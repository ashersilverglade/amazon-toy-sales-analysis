37,4.0,"Fun hoop, but does sag","This hoop is about what you would expect. It has a large basket, which is nice. The adjustable height is easy to operate and is a great feature for a growing kid. I would absolutely recommend this version with 3 balls. The only negative I've found so far is that, similar to other reviewers, the rim does sag down. It appears to be due to a combination of where the backboard connects to the pole and then where the rim connects to the backboard. It is all just plastic snapped together, so the combo of these two imperfect connections means that the rim does have a slight downward sag. It's a kid toy, though, so it ends up not being a huge deal. It seems like something the manufacturer could correct with a slight design change. Overall though, I would recommend the hoop.",[],B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AFRDZS6JQQJ7PSHEPZJ726FBGJXA,1614564154688,1,True

It is &#34;go green&#34; packaging in a large cardboard box with the name of what it is written in small letters, but no photo, explaination or instructions of what is inside. Packaging is large and heavy. Hopefully assembly instructions are included in the box. I'm sure it's pretty easy to assemble without instructions and I'm sure something is included, but it would be nice to have it all right there on the box when they open it, since it is a gift. Just makes it harder for them to see what they are being given.

The net gets unhooked sometimes (not fully apart though) and I have to hook it back on.  The knob where you either put water or sand into the base, was a bit difficult to remove.  I haven't put water or sand into it yet so I cannot comment about that but I would say it's necessary!  Especially for a grabby toddler.  It will easily tip over.

784,5.0,PROVEN LITTLE TIKES BBALL SET,"I would imagine they sold millions of these, because I see it pretty much in every friend's house who has a young boy(s) at home.  There are lots of similar products, and even Little Tikes came up with a one that extends higher in height, but this is perfect for my 16 month old son (currently I have it set on the lowest height and my son walk-dunks on it regularly.  Walmart also had it for cheaper at the time of my search ($29 compared to $34 here at Amazon) but the picture showed only one ball, so I went with this one.  Having three balls is definitely a plus if you don't like to be fetching for your son non-stop.  Some reviewers said the rim falls out over time (and I can see it happening perhaps if you use it a lot), but for us it has held up with no problem after using it for few months (my guess is it might not have clicked all the way during the time of assembly, because they do tell you on the manual to actually step on the rim with the backboard lying flat on the floor to snap it into place).  I have it placed in our living room with the base filled water and my son is not able to tip it over yet so it's quite sturdy and durable so far.  And another thing, I don't know if the designers intended it when they made it, but the front of the base has this slant to it so when the ball drops it nicely rolls back to you if you shoot it straight into the hoop.  Overall, my son loves playing with it from time to time and that makes two of us.",[],B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AEHYVTZQJJF44HZ4VDKRAI4UVSIA,1592947539296,1,True

Joe, 14 and his other cousin, 13 played with it and had a ball. Joe loves basketball and is on his 9th grade team. Anyway, I ordered one for him at his house. He loves it, just doing shots. I ended up ordering one for my house too. I had my two other grandsons, (10 &8), for a few overnights last week and they had a ball playing with it in my entryway. It’s all plastic so nothing get damaged . I just move the little entryway table into a different area, put the basketball stand in front of my entryway door and they go at it. It’s winter and cold here in Michigan, and this is just great even for a boy who will be 15 next month. My only issue is, I’m not sure I put the net on properly, there were no directions. I did enlarge and look at the picture on Amazon to see how they have it and I think I did the exact same thing. Also, we couldn’t get the rim to stay in, but I think the issue was we really hadn’t push it in until we heard it snap. Finally did that with my husband’s help and now it stays in no problem. Love that my grandson have a ball with it here at Nonna’s House. 😊👍🏻🇺🇸",[],B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AGPPHW23GUFN2HSFPNQRVCN4XK6Q,1550360601745,1,True

1308,5.0,Fun introduction to basketball and helps improve gross motor skills,Assembly was pretty quick and easy. The instructions say to pour sand in the base to keep it upright. We decided not to do that and haven’t had any problems. A toddler can definitely pull it down on their own but as it is pretty light weight I doubt that it would ever cause much damage but if you have a small baby around that is something to think about.<br /><br />I got it for my daughter’s first birthday and at first she needed a boost to put the ball in but she soon figured out how to lift the ball above her head and gained the balance necessary to do so and put the ball in. She started walking right around her birthday so it was perfect for helping her to learn to balance better. 4 months later we still love it and play with it often. Ours came with 3 balls.<br /><br />Please mark if you found my review helpful. Thanks!,[],B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AFLBCRL3U4WI226E2LVMLZ222EBQ,1573940617864,3,True

1313,5.0,Fantastic product,"Everything was easy to snap together. The rim took some force and effort to snap all the way in so it wasn’t hanging like in other reviews. But it made a very audible snap when it was together correctly. The balls that come with it are a great size for kids and toddlers. You can also dribble them. Like me and my husband stood at normal height (he’s 6 ft 1 and I’m 5 ft 7) and could dribble them from standing.

We got it a little over a month ago and store it in our garage and get it out when we go outside. It’s so great that it comes wth 3 balls so multiple kids can play at a time and not have to wait for a ball. The different heights are great, the lowest setting works very well for our 2 yo but he likes it to be a challenge so we have it on the highest setting. I only gave 4 stars because we purchased a bag of sand to put in the base to keep it from tipping over easily but it was kind of difficult to get sand in through the hole so eventually we gave up and filled it with water. Also the way the net is attached to the hoop could be a little better, the net keeps slipping back out of the holes (see picture). Overall my husband and I are very pleased with this basketball hoop and so are our kids. It was a great price, and seems like it will last for years.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DVdYZdrYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DVdYZdrYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DVdYZdrYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YrDcW5GlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YrDcW5GlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YrDcW5GlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AENSROLCG6BEFMJP2NTOL4RIIGTA,1527349664347,23,True

1981,5.0,Every child needs this...boys AND girls,"Well made (for being plastic), sturdy even without sand in the base (although it will need the sand when my grandson gets older). Two-year old likes this, although it doesn't keep him busy for hours...I expect it will, though. The selling point on this is the ability to adjust the height, making it a real bargain. How many toys that keep a child ACTIVE can you use over four years? This develops hand and eye coordination and provides lots of movement as children chase the balls. Highly recommended, especially since I find myself (an old grandma) enjoying sitting in a chair and tossing a few hoops, too!<br /><br />Update 1/29/17: A flaw in the design of this is the basket is easily loosened, even by itself. We awoke one night, grabbed the shotgun, and stealthily tiptoed down the steps to discover that the thump we heard in the den was the basket falling off the stand! While it was a relief, then, it is not fun when my grandson throws a ball that hits the rim a few times, then KERPLUNK goes the basket. There is no need for the basket to be this loose as it has no part in the adjustability of the toy for the child as he or she grows. This needs to be redesigned. Grandpa is going to fix this problem with a permanent solution, but obviously the set will never be able to be packed in a box after that.",[],B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AEWZHPUPDP24KTKXACZPYIHDTLAQ,1478391714000,21,True

2469,5.0,Game On!,"We have bought two of these Little Tikes Easy Score Basketball Sets. The first time was for our then four and six-year-old kids. We set it up inside for rainy-day fun. The second time was for my 85-year-old mom to liven up her physical therapy sessions. Her ball boy is my now 13-year-old, former Little Tikes-playing son.<br /><br />I love repurposing products in ways beyond what the manufacturer intended. This hoop has brought a lot of fun into my mom’s workout, and allows her grandson to participate in her exercise program. Don’t let the “tikes” name fool you; this can be a challenging upper body workout for your senior. It tasks four key areas: balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance. We set the hoop on the two and three-foot heights for chair throws. She shoots, my son rebounds, and my mom has to track and catch the ball. We save the four-foot height for standing shots – this works the balance portion of her therapy.<br /><br />She does this for 20-minutes every day. All that arm motion, as well as the effort required to position and launch the ball, and maintain her posture, is a thorough workout for her. Plus, it’s engaging – both physically and generationally: they can do serious work together in a silly way. Its lightweight design poses no tipping hazard, and is easy for both my parents to set up and store. This hoop is one of several products we’ve bought to strengthen my mom’s manual dexterity and fine-motor skills. We also have the [[ASIN:B01FADOJ8K Giant Kerplunk]] (highly recommend for all ages), and the [[ASIN:B06XBZH1DZ RockJam electronic piano keyboard]].<br /><br />Keep your elders in the game with this Little Tikes hoop set.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hvf45F5SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hvf45F5SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hvf45F5SL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zpO4H1lSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zpO4H1lSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zpO4H1lSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AHE2QW3HQFEVOETHNYWQ7R7Z5V2A,1502659475041,7,False

This is the perfect gift for your kid if you have no job and no domestic responsibilities other than following a three-year-old around and fixing their toys every five minutes. If, on the other hand, you have to do things like--oh, I don't know- make breakfast for an entire family every morning before going to work, for example--this thing will drive you slowly insane. I don't wish harm or despair on anyone, but I hope the person who designed this thing has a bad day.",[],B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AHRESL2YLBNFJH5LJZXSWHOPV2HA,1667909271705,3,True

I'm sure most don't have holes and this is probably not a good representation of the product but it definitely was a disappointment discovering this on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />**** Edit *****<br /><br />Product worked great and even with hole in base (so no weight could be added) Item never fell over during intense play by my toddler.

3437,5.0,So Easy To Assemble!,"My children love this not just my toddlers but my 7 year old as well! Came packaged in a clean dent free box, inside it’s in 5 pieces; the base that can be filled with sand for stability, the trunk which adds the height, the backboard piece, the hoop, and the net. It was extremely easy to assemble without the instructions no screws, nuts, or bolts to struggle with. It’s so lightweight and easy to move both inside and outside of the garage so you can play with it even on rainy days. It comes with 3 pre inflated small basketballs (bonus) perfect for my toddlers hands. My 1.5 year old was able to use it and make baskets she does a little happy dance when she makes it in. :) so adorable seeing the look of glee written on their faces! The balls are soft enough that they don’t hurt when someone accidentally bonks themselves. The only complaint I have is it was really really hard to insert the hoop into the back board.

Not sure why, but he saw some kids playing basketball at the park one day six months ago and ever since all he wants to do is play basketball.<br /><br />His grandparents got him this hoop for his second birthday and it has been fantastic. I know this because I myself play a lot of basketball on it. I probably spend a minimum of four hours a week shooting hoops on this thing. As a grown adult, I can say it's actually a fun hoop to play with. The balls are sturdy and bouncy--not made of a cheap, hard plastic like some of the models we've seen. The hoop is sturdy and the whole thing can be moved indoors if it's hot or rainy outside.<br /><br />The only problem we had was a minor one--parts of the net would sometimes slide off from the hoop attachments. It wasn't a big deal just a little annoying. I fixed this by tying a little thread underneath the parts of the net that would slide off (three or four little areas) and we haven't had an issue since.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rD3uN8TtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rD3uN8TtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rD3uN8TtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C5A2WJO,B07XRFH11M,AE2DI2MBMXCOKRUCXJCBPRVEP2JA,1563402445317,0,False
