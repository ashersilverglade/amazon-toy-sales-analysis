0,5.0,Follow directions and you will love it!,"Well as a TOTAL NEWBIE to this whole drone thing I have to admit I was a bit intimidated at first.  Read all the reviews on a MULTITUDE of drones and decided on the F11.  Was scared to death my little black beauty was going to fly away......still have it and have had several successful days.  Love the tips that I was sent for flying tips which explained why I lost control a couple times (stay away from trees that can block satellite connect, duh) and crashed (LOL) all turned out okay despite a scratch or two as expected in this learning phase.  However, it has peaked my dog's interest who thinks this mechanical black bird looks like it could be a lot of fun to chase!  Highly recommend the F11 as it is sturdy for the money apparently and a great learning drone with what seems to have a decent camera & video capabilities.  I have yet to totally master those skills.....ha, ha!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEBOZUPXR2IOM5JJOVZA6EMTM3IA,1587482405971,0,True

I guess I did something wrong you are looking for a wonderful great drone I would definitely recommend this. Easy to assemble, easy controls, great view camera I mean amazing view.

4,1.0,Misleading,"Great advertising.  Wonderful reviews.  Great packaging.  Once it arrived I opened it, set it up, configured the drone.  Anytime I need to connect Wi-Fi to something is when the issues begins.  App wouldn’t connect.  Drone and controller were paired.  I was able to configure the gyroscope and calibrate.  I took it outside and all I wanted to do was a simple up and down motion and the drone went crazy all over my backyard.  Back in the box and a return label was printed.  It’s not as simple as people here claim it to be.  It doesn’t pair well with the app.  Beautiful device, but for 300.00 I can’t risk replacing something if it lands upside somewhere and can’t fly back.<br /><br />Update-  8/3/2022  I’ve been flying drones for years so I know what I’m doing.  Purchased this again and gave it another try.  First day it was perfect.  Second day there is lots of miscommunication, drone is spinning out of control and I’m in beginner mode to get used to this new product.

The only problem I encountered was it doesn't know to avoid obstacles, so make sure you don't fly it too close to anything while not familiar with the remote control.<br />I've tested all the functionality, and they are all there, just make sure you stay in the Beginner mode until you're confortable enough with control the drone.<br />Charging the drone and the remote control is easy, as they both use the same charger (USB).",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AESSTMEMLNY6EZYHFBGRB3EXPH5A,1608998501671,0,True
7,5.0,Easy To Learn,"Takes a little practice, but if you go easy on the controls you get used to it pretty quickly. I got the hang of it as a complete drone newbie after about 15 minutes. It takes several hours to charge the battery and it's only 28-30 minutes - the only real downside. The camera is very good, but the angle controls are a little clumsy so it can take a little bit to get the camera shot just right.

Absolutely, it is easiest to set up and use, not much complicate like another drone I have tried. It is good for beginners and experience. It has an awesome battery, for sure it with 2 batteries you can fly around 60 minutes, I need to upgrade my phone which has last long battery to use this drone.  I love the price, actually, it is a good price for a drone. I have a cheap one under $200, but I need to return it quickly for a couple of days to work on it. Why? it lost signal, can't catch GPS signal as well as, battery is said 20 minutes, but actual was 9 -13 minutes. And another one like DJI is expensive to afford it.

I love the altidude locking. The return home feature is perfect.<br />Works as advertised.

19,5.0,"Steady in the air, looong battery life","After going the cheap route - I earlier bought and quickly returned two under-$100 drones - I decided to get serious and spend a little more money for something that was more solid. I read and read ... and read, and became discouraged because it appeared as though I was going to have to spend $700+ (and probably $1,000+) to find a good drone with all of the features I wanted: high-resolution video and stills camera, good battery life, long range.<br /><br />And then I found the Ruko F11 Pro, for an amateur price :). The reviews were consistent - this seemed like a professional quality drone for about $300. The battery has a 30-minute flight time, and it came with two batteries. It had all the features I wanted or needed as a beginner pilot.<br /><br />The other drones I had bought immediately veered away on take off, finding the most convenient nearby tree to ""hide"" in. This Ruko F11 Pro drone was steady from the start: a straight-up take-off, even with a little wind. The remote control feels sturdy, and my phone connected easily to the app. The camera quality is awesome. I bought a little USB card reader that plugs in my computer so I can easily download the hi-res drone video footage.<br /><br />My son and I have only flown it for one day, and we both had a great time. (Maybe dad had even more fun haha.) I have wanted a drone for awhile, and I am glad I spent a little bit more than the ""toy drone"" price range to find something that is a blast right out of the box.

20,5.0,This Drone Has Everything You Need and a Little More,"I’m so glad I purchased this drone instead of the DJI Mavic Mini for my son's first drone. I spent the better part of a day reading a learning a lot of information about drones. I also wanted to purchase a drone for him that he could possibly  use or get experience to use for recording football games since he also films for the high school football team. Video clarity and the stability overall while in the air was a major factor in my decision to purchase this drone. I watched a video that was recorded by another reviewer and after watching and reading other reviews and you tube videos, I quickly clicked out of the video and hit purchase! I almost caved and bought him the more expensive dji mavic mini and even with using the education discount combined with refurbished price it wasn’t worth it compared to the value and quality I feel this drone offers. My son is very pleased with his drone and we have been enjoying the videos it has captured- really amazing. I will return and upload one as soon as I can get him to cut a video down.

From opening the box and finding the very nice storage case that holds everything, including the impressive F11 Pro & the controller, spare battery, spare propellers, & instruction manual, everything all fits in this amazing case with room for more.  I thought it was probably too windy (6-10 mph) but I really wanted to try this baby out and I am glad I did.  The F11 handled remarkably well, the wind did push it around a little bit, but it was still very easy to navigate.  The app was very smooth and intuitive.  I only tested a few of the apps cool features on the maiden voyage, but everything I tested worked perfect.  This is my first real drone and I could not be any happier!

This was my first drone with the primary purpose of getting photos and videos perspectives I otherwise would not be able to.  It was an exciting prospect.<br /><br />Flying the drone was surprisingly easy (I had zero experience prior to purchasing it).  It is a very maneuverable and steady drone with a lot of very useful features.  My primary goal however was to use it as a platform for photography.  For this purpose it was quite disappointing.  The pictures and videos were marginal, at best- they reminded me of shots captured from a 15 year old Cellphone (poor contrast and white balance, over-sharpened yet not clear, etc.). This was ultimately the deal-breaker for me, and I sent it back as I just could not justify the cost for something I was not going to use for it's intended purpose.

43,4.0,"More than I bargained for, for sure.... Follow up 12 days later.","Prior to this drone, I used to have Yuneec Q500 4K Typhoon, 3x the price of F11 Pro.  I say I ""used to"" because my CO3 Camera ST10 got busted during last landing (I consider it a flaw in design in the way cables are exposed to stress in case of a hard landing).  F11 Pro does not have this issue but the trade off is that video can get a bit shaky in a windy weather.  However, at this point, I don't care.  My my meager needs, F11 Pro fits the bill.  It lasts much longer than my previous drone (Yuneec) which means more air time.  On top of it, this ""entry"" level drone had features that my $850+ Typhoon did not have, namely fly by ""wire"" so to speak.  What I mean by this, set a number of way points, press go, and the drone will execute the path flawlessly.  It's great if you want to take a video of an area, for example.<br /><br />I see plenty of ""happy"" hours with this drone as it really makes you want to use it rather than worrying about breaking it.<br /><br />2020-07-16<br />This is a follow up to my review above.  I took 1 star away from my review due to a faulty motor. I had this drone only for 12 days and I had to replace it due to a front right motor failure.  Lucky for me, it did not happen up in the air but on the ground when I tried to take off.  So, I am not sure if I simply got a lemon or the product itself and workmanship is at fault here.<br /><br />I have to give high marks to the company for promptly replacing the drone.  I got it literally the day after.  Thank you, Ruko, for such a great customer support.  When criticism is warranted, I will criticize and when praise is required, I will give praise. I took my replacement drone today for its virgin flight.  Let's see if this time it does not break after only a few flights.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFY6KN5VH3GZIHP6SNGOBLHRMBHQ,1594076853904,0,True
44,4.0,Could be perfect…,My friend got a DJI drone and I was really amazed at the technology. I didn’t want to spend a $1000 so I searched the features and came to this drone. So this drone wowed me during the initial flight. There is a slight learning curve that I had to get past calibrating the compass etc but once it acquires the necessary GPS you’re ready to fly. This part was what hooked me. Easy to control and the picture is great. You can even set waypoints to have it fly to automatically. The flight time is right at 30mins and will auto return if the battery gets too low. The only major drawback I can see vs other drones is the camera loses signal at around 100 meters. Otherwise this could be a long term keeper. Compared to the DJI mini 2 the distance is roughly 10km. So easily you will reach the max distances of this drone which is assume is the cause for the price difference. BUT the DJI Mini 2 is actually around the same price. So my advice is to go ahead and get the DJI Mini 2 unless you want to just operate within line of sight.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1BorOpD1fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1BorOpD1fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1BorOpD1fL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGGZFLMHWK6G3OCD573HY6JAUZIA,1627995640472,0,False
45,5.0,It's worth the price,"The first drone I bought met it's end in a tree and power line. I guess the interference of the power line wiped out any control I had over it. But before I did that I knew that I wanted another drone that: came with a box/case, had a longer flying time and a camera I could aim.<br />This drone is soooo much better than the first one I had. It's also a little more than two and a half times more expensive too. As a photog I appreciate the ability to rotate the camera (which isn't a bad little camera for it's size and intended use) to get the angle I need. My first flight was in the back yard under a pecan and crape myrtles. I was able to pretty easily avoid the lawn furniture and branches. It's much easier to control than I expected.<br />I like the carrying case. It's going to come in handy - I am going to be travelling about the countryside and having the drone protected while bouncing about off road will be nice. It holds the drone, extra battery, controller and extra parts. Plus, there's a zippered compartment in the lid for the instructions and FAA certificate.<br />What else.....? The camera angle is controllable while flying. That's a huge plus. It's stable and much quieter than the first drone i had.<br /><br />NOTE: the controller does not accept a ""plus"" phone like the iPhone 8 plus. it probably wont fit a Note either. Not a deal breaker but it is something that you are going to have to work around. I used a wide rubber band today which worked great, actually.

It was more expensive than money but compared to a few others I've seen that other people have, this one runs much longer, almost 30 minutes per battery, and came with two batteries.  Plus, this is heavier than the cheaper ones so you would think the battery would not last as long as the light weight drones.  The app is very nice, it has strong motors, feels sturdy.  I ran it through all of the features it can do and all of them work well.  I'm still learning, and gradually going higher and farther each time.  I noticed if it gets behind a lot trees, the app, even with 5G, has a delay on the camera screen, but my dad's cheaper drone with only 2.4 G has a bad delay when there are no trees in the way.

The video quality was phenomenal for such a small camera and i saw no pixelation or lag even when flying at an altitude of 100 mtrs and distance of 400 mtrs.<br /> I would definitely recommend this drone if you’re thinking about getting one but arent ready to drop more than 200-300$ for your first one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SFX6cu6CL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SFX6cu6CL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SFX6cu6CL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yq75tcEJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yq75tcEJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yq75tcEJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGL5ZQOJ4QDU4SQCSPYPSUYU3I5A,1591228792887,0,True

75,2.0,Issues with Video and Photo Reliability,"Rugged, easy to learn and use, smart features, integrates easily with phone.  However, there are significant camera limitations.  While it advertises a 4K UHD camera, the video on the F11 Pro is 2.7K, and the photos are the same resolution as the video (video and photos are 2976x1680).  This means 5 megapixel photos, rather than the advertised 8 megapixel photos if true 4K photos.  The video and photos are a fisheye, as would be expected with the 120 degree view.  Video can be unstable, since there is no camera stabalization.<br /><br />Calibration is easy and has been reliable. Hovers very steadily once calibrated.  Return to Home feature very accurate.  Certain recommend as a beginner drone as long as the video / photo specs meet your needs.  Battery life meets advertised flying time.<br /><br />--Updating review.  Still no 4K photos, and more than once the video failed to save to the SD card.  Other times the video file is corrupt.

85,2.0,"Amazing until it failed, zero customer service","This is (was) my first drone.  Was?  Yeah, it’s smoked and no bringing it back to life.  That’s the bad part.  The good? I’m a first timer, so I have nothing to compare it to, but here goes.<br /><br />The good:  Flight capabilities are amazing.  It feels well built.  The fold in arms are very stable.  The motors are powerful and the battery performance was as advertised.  Although the motors are brushless, 4 rotors spinning will make quiet a bit of noise—not a flaw, just a fact of physics.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The software is very limited.  The same software is used for 4 different drones and you have to select the correct type each time you choose to fly.  I did try to set up way point flying, but I couldn’t get it to work.  Cell coverage is very bad in my area, so that may have been part of the issue.  In the settings, you can use beginner settings for the allowable range of the drone.  If you turn off beginner settings, you can adjust the range to 1200 meters.  Be very careful adjusting that range setting.  I think this is one reason for fly aways/lost drones.<br />The manual is not good.  It gives you the basics, but you need to find another source to understand the details of things like headless mode and what happens if you turn off GPS.  It’s recommended that beginners fly with support of an experienced operator—that’s a good idea.  Definitely want to take time to work through and learn all controls.<br />The camera is ok, but not great.  No stabilization, but that costs more.<br /><br />The end: Zero customer service.  You buy it, you fly it, you break it, maybe you can fix it, maybe you can’t.  I had a motor fail, I attempted to contact customer service via email and have never received a reply.  I purchased a replacement rotor assembly, installed it, ended up smoking the electronics, now I have a drone paper weight.<br /><br />Buyer beware—despite the impressive performance, if/when it fails, your money is gone.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEFTQZXGLSHWNUA7XJO3GXRQVRXA,1592860593102,2,True

I receive my new drone and inspected it and found that it was brand new.  I charged the batteries and the remote control unit for a couple of days.  We have been having bad weather with rain and wind for the past two weeks so I decided against test flying it.  Today after connecting the drone to to the app on my iPhone and calibrating the compass and syncing to the GPS I flew it for the first time.  It flew flawless and took outstanding pictures and movie clips.  It cost around $300, but it's well worth it.  I flew it in my backyard for about 25 minutes on one battery.  The controls was great even on my iPhone.  I recommend this drone to anyone whether you are a beginner or a professional.  Start with this one until you are comfortable paying thousands of dollars only to crash an expensive drone.  I've flown both and all sorts and sizes and this one is right up there with the pros.

110,5.0,Well made feature packed drone,"The Roku F11-Pro GPS is my first drone and I could not be more pleased with the product.  Although the quick start guide tells you everything you need to know to start flying, I strongly recommend that you read the included manual to better understand all the features of the drone.<br /><br />Following the flight preparation procedure in the quick start guide, I easily paired the controller with the drone.  The Wi-Fi signal from the drone was strong and my phone quickly connected.  The calibration process for the drone's compass was straight forward and linking with a GPS signal fairly quick.<br /><br />Both the drone and controller are well made.  The drone is good size and unfolds to a size of 10 x 8.5  inches from motor center to motor center (16 × 18 inches from the tips of the propellers).  The battery life is very good and will probably come close to the 30 minutes advertised.  The drone comes with two batteries, so flight time shouldn't be an issue.  The drone comes with extra propellers and screws, charging cable, controller, padded carrying case, and instruction manual.  You can also add a 32 GB micro SD card (not included) to the drone to store photos and videos.<br /><br />The controller has a built in rechargeable battery that outlasts the drone batteries.  It has handles that unfold from the bottom of the controller, a spring loaded clasp that folds out from the center of the controller to firmly hold your cell phone, and a dual antenna that also folds out from the body of the controller.  The controller is packed with features to fly the drone and control the camera.  The 4k camera takes great photos and videos that are transmitted to your phone by the drone's Wi-Fi.  With the SJ-GPS Pro App, you can view live video from the drone and control many of the drone's functions.  The App is reasonably easy to use and intuitive.<br /><br />After flight preparation, take off can be accomplished by pushing the left joy stick forward to rev up the motors and launch the drone  vertically.  You can also press the land/takeoff button on the upper right face of the controller.  Two joy sticks are used to control the drone's altitude and direction.  Landing can be accomplished in three ways: manually using the joy sticks, pressing the home landing button if you have a good GPS signal, or by pressing the land/takeoff button.<br /><br />I am still learning how to use all the features this drone includes, such as the follow me mode, way point flight, and point of interest flight.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o3h7qbLJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o3h7qbLJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o3h7qbLJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yHE36XYKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yHE36XYKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yHE36XYKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEQX7DVF7IXYIGH4HLH2X4HLLMXA,1599529234408,1,True

On the downside, the absolute downside, I got sent a second unit and now with more experience with these drones I can honestly say they are terrible.  They do not hover in place, constant adjustments need to be made.  Sometimes they fly off on their own (for fun I guess), and lastly, what ultimately lost this drone was its obsession with circling in large circles at high speed, something I’ve heard of as toilet bowling, or I guess doing the reverse and shooting off into who-knows-where.

Also the camera just randomly gave out the last time the app crashed, but the seller offered a new camera to install with an extra battery for free so all will be good. With all these scams and crap dealers it’s good to know that the seller will own up to a defect and honor their warranty.

As a beginner who never used a drone before but was a aircraft mechanic in the Air Force so I have knowledge of flight attitudes etc. This drone was simple to get flying in an hour.

In between gusts I would fly drone low and go higher as I gained confidence. Finally got anxious and brought up to 30 meters to take a few pictures and video. All I can say Is WOW!!!!!  Quality is unreal.<br />Batteries lasted 20-25 minutes each before I stopped flying drone. Controller still has a full charge.<br /><br />Like i said before, I find this a perfect drone for me as a beginner BUT will grow with me as I learn more. Settings page lets you set height/speed etc limits that you can change later. For instance as a beginner drone is set to max out at 30 meters (100’) but you can change that later to allow full travel of about 120 meters (~400’).<br /><br />If you want to step into droning but dont want to spend a lot of money to crash.

147,5.0,**UPDATED** Have to charge everything before flying. But still a good drone.,"[[VIDEOID:839610ab6d64f15fe37cad143c1756bf]] The drone came with everything it said it would and you can leave a video review of you flying the drone to get an extra battery. I was going to give 5 stars but upon opening the box to check to see if I could start flying the drone, none of the batteries were charged enough for a decent review of the drone. So now I have to charge the drone (which they state 3.5 hours) and it's almost night time here (I wanted to fly in the day time). I will update later after I have had a chance to fly and test out the drone and its features.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />After charging it and having a chance to fly the drone. I updated my  review to 5 stars. The drone controls good and is a beginner friendly drone. I did have trouble flying due to it was dark and couldn't see anything while using the phone app. Overall I had a great time flying and would buy again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91NMBPBf4KL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91NMBPBf4KL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91NMBPBf4KL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A16upQ4zdvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A16upQ4zdvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A16upQ4zdvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Et1ZC9vBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Et1ZC9vBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Et1ZC9vBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ixTvmu0PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ixTvmu0PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ixTvmu0PL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ygcaCXlGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ygcaCXlGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ygcaCXlGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGADBRKFVO2WR6Y22RTASKTJHQ2Q,1610752901499,0,True

149,5.0,Better than I hoped for,Just want to start by saying I am not giving this 5 stars because I think it is the best drone on the market. I am giving it 5 stars because I believe that at this price point this is about as much as you can ask for. Many features you would find in a much more expensive drone but at a price you can justify for your first learn to fly drone. Took me five mins to get it operational and the drone took right off and held position. Your not going to get image stabilization or 4k video but you will get a crisp image and decent 2.7K video. I wouldn't buy this if making money from drone photography was my thing but if you want to experience what it's like to fly a drone and maybe learn to fly so you can make money then this is a great start. Had my 9 and 10 yo children flying it with very little instruction and no crashes. GPS feature works great and return to home is perfect if you're worried about crash landings. Many more features I didn't mention and some I haven't played with yet but wouldn't hesitate to recommend this drone to any beginner enthusiasts.,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGQD3LIEYAVQZMWA4UEMVEWSBIAA,1611174290955,0,True

177,5.0,Totally worth the money!,"This was the first serious drone I bought after flying some little toys.  I LOVE my F11 Pro!  Very easy to fly.  The app is very intuitive and makes it really easy to get everything set up properly.  This drone will return to the takeoff point if it flies out of transmitter range, or if the battery gets too low.  I have tested both of these features and they work great.  A couple times I forgot to check my battery level and suddenly my F11 Pro flew back to me all on it's own!  Because the F11 Pro is heavier than many other drones in this price range, it handles wind better than anything else I fly.  I can fly my F11 Pro on days I couldn't fly anything else.  Flight time on a battery is amazing!  GPS stabilization works beautifully.  If I am headed for trouble, I let go of both sticks and my F11 Pro just hovers in place until I decide what I want to do.

I will come back later to update after time has passed and many more hours of flight.<br /><br />Pros:  Follow the instructions and it is easy to calibrate.  Once calibrated, it is super easy to fly, as it hovers in place if you let go of the controller sticks.  I did find that it is pretty sensitive to movement on the sticks and it will take some time to get used to moving them slowly for a smoother video.<br />Good video and photo quality.  I have added a still with this review to give an example of the photo quality.<br />The flight time is pretty good!  I haven't gotten a whole 30 minutes out of it so far since there has been some pretty stiff breezes while flying over the last 2 days, between 4 and 9 mph (according to my weather station).  It handled it very well, though I wouldn't want to fly in anything over that.  That's just me.<br />It connected to satellites, the controller and the android tablet quickly with no problem and stayed connected while I was flying.  I only pushed it out to 70 meters so far at 30 meters height so it wasn't a true test.<br />I tried out the Point of Interest feature, which works great!  I also found the return home feature to be very useful.  It came close enough to the pad I launched it from to satisfy me, being that there was some wind each time.  When it was only blowing a couple mph, it landed within 6 inches of the spot it took off from.  The furthest it landed was 3 meters away.<br /><br />It appears to be well built, solid.<br /><br />There are only a few things I think could have been better at this price point<br />The fish eye look when the camera is tilted down - but it does straighten out when the camera is horizontal so I can't complain about that too much.<br /><br />There could be something to make it more clear which is front and rear when it is flying near enough to see it clearly with the eyes.  As long as you're using FPV, that's not bad either.<br /><br />The only other thing I think could have improved is having a sound when it shuts down as well as the musical sound when it starts up.  Another small thing that sure isn't a deal breaker.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NHyWtBeLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NHyWtBeLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NHyWtBeLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFQCQAR442F4UDMILEU42IYOLQ2A,1625003933733,0,True

186,5.0,"Compact, intuitive and fun! Great drone for beginner through intermediate!","I just received my Ruko F11 Pro Drone from Amazon.  I am amazed at how compact and portable it is. I am a beginner drone flyer, but I have watched the instruction video (which wasn’t too bad), but then I watched Captain Drone’s review along with another reviewer on YouTube. Both showed off the capabilities of the F11 Pro and really went into details about the operation of the drone.<br /><br />I love how you can set up a beginners “wall”, where it won’t go beyond 30 meters away or above you.  It is very useful for learning to fly without the “headless” mode.<br /><br />One thing that I liked was the quick reference card they provided.  The instruction manual is very helpful, but the quick reference card was something that I could have handy while I was flying.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this drone. I had a Potensic T25, but the battery life was too short, so I purchased the F11. I had 25 minutes of flight my first time out (right out of the box), and there were only three of four charging lights on when I started.  I think I will get 30 minutes from a fully charged battery.<br /><br />The case that it comes in is also perfect, however the drone folds up so nicely that you could drop it in a backpack and not need the case at all.  The drone seems very sturdy and I think is made to be able to take a beating.<br /><br />If I had to complain about anything (so far), it would be that when you mount the phone onto the controller, the side of the phone somewhat blocks access to the buttons that take photos and video.  Other than that, I think you will really enjoy this drone!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGSHQNZ5LV7NWSWQ6ZM6K2G2EJGQ,1580661446336,5,True

They were fun, but had no range and easily broke.  Yes, I learned a bit on how to control one but still it was not that good.<br /><br />I took time off of my hobbies for a while.  But this past year (2020) and with gift money for the holiday I decided to get back into drones.  I used my cash and bought this gem.  It is the best thing I have bought that is remote controlled. I am so glad that Amazon has teamed up with Ruko.  My 1st drone came with a broken remote.  Amazon took the replacement and sent me a new one the next day.  Ruko got back to be super quick.  All is well.  (I think that shipping was the cause of the issue and not amazon or Ruko).  Anyhow, as you can see from the video I am up and running.  It takes a bit of time to get used to so the ""beginner"" level is nice.  It never got away from me as I learn the tools and functions.

192,4.0,F11 the drone for the new pilots,"I took a long time to write a review for the ruko f11 for many reasons. Most importantly is the fact I crashed mine the first day. Ya... I know, it was a stupid crash too of my own poor choice. But the things I expierenced after fixing my drone could of been result of my actions. So I will review what your getting from ruko.<br /><br />  The f11 is a great drone for its price range. It's a great drone for adults to learn with. The f11 also can produce in the field in most ways ruko claims. The package ruko offers however is a matter of POV. This one offers the f11 4k model with spare battery and case.<br /><br />  The f11 is not of ruko but of sjrc. Ruko is also not the only provider of f11 types. Sjrc offers its versions of the f11 as well. Ruko deserves credit and a bit of support for a more recent app released for the f11. If ruko decides to make the app work for only thier named drones, would be tragic and noted. But as far as I know has not come to pass.<br /><br />  Offered in this package is 2 battery. That's not bad, I've seen deals over 300 that only offer 1 from other vendors. Ive also seen packages from vendors under 250 that offer 3 batteries.<br /><br />  It should be noted you are offered a free 3rd battery for giving a positive review. I cannot say I appreciate these offers. It's also why I gave a 4 star review.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AG6VHH26DBVWJHNYPWJJC5W23IMQ,1603820609005,0,True

I bought another battery and another set of propellers just in case.<br /><br />I crashed it into a tree already.  Scuffed it up but nothing broken.  It was my fault.  Initially with the app it is in Beginner Mode.  It limits you as to how far, how high it will go/fly.  I wanted to go further and higher and somehow messed that up.  It tore off and went sideways into a tree.  Day 2.  I took it off of Beginner mode and adjusted hot far and how high it will go. No problems.  Went 341 meters away and 32meters high.  No problems and very fun.  I like the fly home feature.  I can land it myself but it's cool to press a button and here she comes.  LOL.<br /><br />It's very easy to learn on.  The app is easy to understand and also has a Quick Start guide in the app which is useful.<br /><br />The app also logs some stats on your flight.  Video is good and it saves to my phone also.<br /><br />Can't go wrong with this as your first drone.

197,5.0,Fun little drone!,"I had wanted a drone for a while. I didn’t want a toy, but at the same time didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars to buy a “real” drone. I read several reviews raving about the quality of F11 Pro, but was a bit skeptical. Then Amazon offered the drone as one of their lightning deals.  I decided to take the risk and I’m glad I did.<br /><br />Flying the drone is relatively easy (I’m still getting the hang of trying to navigate with the added dimension of up & down). In addition to the instruction manual, there is a quick start guide on the box as well as a handy dandy sheet with instructions on how to begin your first flight. Within a few minutes, I was in the air. Unfortunately a few minutes later I crashed into the side of our porch, but that was due to my piloting prowess, or rather lack thereof, and not the drone. I was worried I might have totaled it, but other than a bit of dirt from hitting the ground everything seemed fine, so I’m guessing it must be pretty durable.<br /><br />One of the main criticisms I’ve seen in reviews is the camera quality. I have yet to try filming anything so I can’t comment on that, but the camera stream on my phone using their app seemed pretty good.<br /><br />There are several other features (such as the GPS system) which I haven’t fully explored yet, but even without them I think the F11 is pretty amazing. While it might not be suitable for young children, it makes a great beginner drone if you’re looking to have some fun without having to spend an arm & a leg.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFRPVY5UQL6UQWMFM4656EHETCIQ,1580342213067,1,True

I went through forward and back, up and down, 360 L and R then into a low hover and with the stick back the drone approaches the earth hesitates and slowly lowers itself to the ground and slows the blades!  It helps that I am a Flight Instructor and am used to delicate handling of the controls, but I had the feeling that were I complete newly the result would be the same.

Other wise their is a small learning curve to understanding what your doing when your setting up to fly. But once you get your first flight in you’ll be set.<br /><br />  The speed of the drone is nice not as fast as some but the weight of the drone has a lot to do with that. Up to this point I had only flown smaller drones like the dji ski rider which is about 1/6th the size of the F11 but all in all it’s quick.<br /><br />The distance from which you can fly away from the controller is excellent. I was surprised at how far I could go before I was shown on the screen I had weak receiver signal.<br /><br />It comes with an extra battery which none of the other drones I looked at buying had you had to buy them extra for around 50$US. That was a huge influence seeing as with 2 batteries you can fly up to an hour. The batteries are also excellent they last as long as stated in the description of the item. Also the case is very nice everything has its slot even the extra battery and spare parts. The case is foam lined for protection and zips up tight so nothing flops around.<br /><br />The follow me setting works well and way point setting too. I have just tried these out I haven’t used them for any specific reason.<br /><br />I have no dislikes really the drone is awesome easy to fly easy for beginners to learn. And has awesome distance and altitude. I love it if your in the market for a drone you won’t be disappointed with the Ruko F11 Pro or the Ruko F11 since the only difference between the two is the camera is 4K on the pro and I believe 1080p on the standard F11. All in all I’m very happy and satisfied with the product and the price for what you get is about the best for what you get.,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AENFUAFII3LJEOOZ27VSJS7AUSCQ,1586749314774,0,True
222,5.0,"Absolutely great drone, camera. Perfect beginner drone!","[[VIDEOID:ef1ea654c067fae94d47e3f5f892c32f]] This drone is incredible! It's easy to learn to fly and the GPS works great! I do recommend you try it at a large open space such as a soccer field or somewhere because this thing is FAST! But you can slow it down too. The controls are very easy to learn and on only my second outing I trusted it enough to push it out there, going 245 meters out and 52.8 meters high- all displayed on your cell phone! Features work great- follow me, orbit etc. And the camera is incredible! I didn't get a storage card and it automatically saved everything on my phone!<br />My only complaint is that the bracket that holds your phone didn't open enough to hold my phone with the Otterbox cover on it- I had to take my cover off. But other than that, I can't give enough praise for this drone! Incredible for the price.

233,5.0,I’m a total novice & this worked great for me. Buy it.,"[[VIDEOID:d49ffea7a7bf53363d3efc3dc1a25177]] I’m a total newbie when it comes to drones and so is my 20 year old son. 10 years ago my son lost a $60 toy drone when he flew it into a tall tree on its first flight because the technology was immature and unstable back then and he couldn’t control it. I felt really bad for him but there was nothing we could do. Fast forward to 2020. I bought this drone to get both of us back into the hobby and to correct the mistakes of the past. The video I’ve attached to this review is from our very FIRST flight with this drone! We were able to takeoff and land effortlessly and the controls were very intuitive. The camera takes high quality video and was easy to use. Of course, my son is a total geek and was able to figure out the drone and remote control without even reading the instructions so that was a big help. But there’s no reason you can’t do the same if you follow the instructions and take your time. We also watched a couple of YouTube videos that demonstrated how to configure and fly this exact same drone so that was a big help. Some things that were described in the instructions weren’t clear and the YouTube video cleared up the confusion. It’s funny because I just assumed that this drone would crash and burn on its first flight just like what happened ten years ago but the exact opposite happened. Both of our initial flights were an astounding success and my son had a great time flying this thing. In fact I had to plead with him for the remote control so that I could get some flying time. Each of the two batteries lasted about 22 minutes which was plenty of flight time for us. Needless to say, we are both hooked and can’t wait for our next flight. This drone was a lot more stable and controllable than I expected. With the GPS feature enabled It almost seemed to have a mind of its own when it comes to takeoff and landing. And the return to home button worked like a charm. What a difference ten years makes. Overall I am very pleased with the high quality and performance of this drone and I would recommend it to any beginner. If you’re on the fence and, like me, can’t decide whether $300 is worth it, let me tell you that it is worth every penny. Just buy it, and you can thank me later.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Psq9bT0VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Psq9bT0VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Psq9bT0VL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lLoWBoyiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lLoWBoyiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lLoWBoyiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFBQ7EGC7YCLLYJVP327VIRCJ3SQ,1594338658828,0,True

However with all the glowing reviews for this drone surprised me once I got it and took it out for a demo.<br /><br />The range is not very good. It's not even decent. You can go just about a mile out, but only if unobstructed. On fact, once I started to get about 400 ft out, controls were in and out. I did manage to get out about 600 ft befor the drone decided it was time to RTH.<br /><br />I think video quality was ok for a couple hundred ft, but wasn't 4k by any stretch. I believe it is ""upscaled"" 720p.<br /><br />This drone also does the toilet bowl thing. Very strange thing to witness.<br /><br />The remote is super basic and feels cheap. The ""antennas"" aren't. The actual antenna is inside the control box.<br /><br />The app is so vague that one actually has to read the directions to figure out what some of the hieroglyphics mean. There are a couple of doodads on the back of the remote that do not serve a purpose.<br /><br />Battery life was a dismal 16 minutes on one fully charged battery and 18 on the other fully charged battery.<br /><br />But wait, there's more.<br /><br />Just kidding.

I had never used a drone before and purchased to scare cormorants off my sailboat.  I had it working in no time.  I made a couple of mistakes, such as taking off from a table (where it crashed on landing) and flying it into a tree - and amazingly it kept on working.  Unfortunately, my boat was too far out on a mooring, and the drone lost video - which made it impossible.  I was successful with boats closer in - it worked fabulosly.  Other than the loss of video at about 1000m, the product is outstanding.  They do offer a free battery if you write a good review - which may explain why there are so many in so much detail.  But after purchase, these reviews seem warranted and accurate.  Now i need to find a new use case for this excellent drone.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AH3DIRANJDNR7FS3ZU4JBLIIGRCQ,1601298031806,0,True

The video quality is better than I expected. I watched a lot of video on YouTube before making a purchase. There are tons of comparisons of different drones to watch and the video footage is awesome. I really didn’t want to spend $800.00 and up for a high end drone and then not enjoy flying.  Finally I found this Drone with 30 minute  battery life and the batteries do last as advertised. Well I was sold and now I am so impressed with it that there won’t be another drone. The second flight was an hour ago. The flag in my yard is straight out and this drone held itself steady. I stuck the landing two times and feel like a pro already. It has auto land but I like being in control of the flight. I am 65 and wanted something to mess around with after I retire next spring. This is going to be great. I may take it out fishing and do some checking around behind sandbars and such. Looking for reduced current where there might be a walleye hanging out.

For the wall charger I got one with two usb ports each providing 5V/2.4 amps which charges the batteries in just a few hours.; the one I got is also a multistage charger meaning I can leave the batteries connected overnight without fear of overcharging, when the batteries are fully charged the charger automatically goes into a maintenance mode.

I am not a drone expert and felt this drone was perfect for me both for price and other reviewers saying about it.  I do have an issue with camera not moving but I haven't gone through troubleshooting tips on that yet and I'm sure it is a simple issue as described in documentation.  Camera image is very good, I'd say excellent.  Only issue is if there is any wind and you don't control drone well enough the image will be a bit shaky but not bad.  You won't be using the footage in a feature film anyway so it is very good for this price.  The drone was very responsive, fast, and easy to control and maneuver.

304,5.0,Built and Flys like a more expensive drone!,"[[VIDEOID:e7c2a8b824aaf3bdb48daa92df108ac6]] Got this drone about a week ago and have put in about 10 hours so far in the hot Texas sun. I have flown other more expensive drones and I was very suspect as to how this drone would be. Needless to say I WAS NOT disappointed!<br /><br />FEATURES YOU WILL LOVE<br />I did extensive research and need a drone to inspect my roof with the recent electrical storms that we have been having. My major requirements were great quality FPV camera, well built and long flight time. This drone remarkably exceeds all that and more. Not only does thie F11 Pro fly like a champ (even in moderate wind), it has amazing features like a more expensive drone. I have used the automatic takeoff and landing which is accurate to roughly 1 ft or less. The safety features for beginners, like a safety range and auto return are excellent. In fact, my wife didn't want to fly it until I showed her how well those safety features worked. One of the things that I absolutely love on this drone is the ability to toggle the reaction time for the flight controls. Located as a roller switch at the top left, I can toggle whether I want the F11 Pro to respond quickly or have a software response for my wife and 3 year old nephew. It has all the other features like more expensive drones like follow me, waypoint navigation and orbit.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY<br />This drone is so well built! It seems its made very sturdy plastic but not brittle. I thought since this was a decent priced drone it was meant for more seasoned pilots that wont knock it around. Well I realized quickly that this thing is super durable. Since the F11 Pro allows you to learn really quickly with its safety features, I didn't have MAJOR crashes, but I have ran it into a few things (Fence, Chairs, Wall) trying to learn how to land. Just when it thought I completely destroyed the props, to my surprise they were just fine. AND the F11 pro come with replacement props so it even better. Its super quiet and handles great at high altitude or in ground effect.<br /><br />CAMERA<br />One of the requirements was a 4K camera, good luck trying to find a drone in this price range with an articulating camera. All the other drones I researched showed the FPV video quality like 720p or worse. Even the 1080p drones sometimes only recorded 1080p and wasn't necessarily broadcasting in that resolution. This drones video quality is outstanding (see the attached video), the pictures look incredible. I was able to get great pictures for my roof inspection. I have not had the video feed drop out or even begin to lose connection. I cant wait to try test out its range in an open field eventually.<br /><br />BUY THIS DRONE... you will not be disappointed, I'm getting obsessed!

It was really, really easy to fly!  Since I am a beginner I did get confused on which way to move the controls a couple of times.

I ordered the F11 pro.<br /><br />My initial response was well I just don’t get this. It folds up nice and small. It came with two batteries a little screwdriver and a couple sets of helicopter blades and the helicopter and the remote control.<br /><br />Initially I charge the batteries and was very happy the next day when I woke up and they both were green good to go.<br /><br />I had tried playing with the helicopter at home. But I was not ready to turn it on and take it out for a flight until I was certain I was in a place where I knew I would not ruin it on my first flight<br /><br />I had emailed the company back-and-forth a couple times about questions about the helicopter. The company was very forthcoming and responsive to my stupid questions.<br /><br />Of course the company never referred to my questions as being stupid.<br /><br />So here I am at a campground in north eastern Pennsylvania. They have a part of the campground where hot air balloons take off daily. So we thought that would be a great place to try out the helicopter.<br /><br />So our first day was a little bit of a learning curve. I have had other helicopters but none of them ever were successful and we’re not GPS or any quality whatsoever.<br /><br />I watch the video on how you should use your new drone for the first time. It listed the five things you should do before you’re confident enough to take your drone out.<br /><br />So we followed his steps and it was definitely worth practicing our landings hovering and basic Fleitmann ship skills.<br /><br />One of our first big things we were the happiest with was bringing up the helicopter to 75 feet and turning on the camera and spinning around in a circle.<br /><br />We had some great photographs that we took over the next couple days.<br /><br />We had one near miss as I accidentally turned off the GPS and the helicopter went flying into the woods. It’s survived and work just as well afterwards.<br /><br />We practice the next couple days taking off and landing taking photographs and adjusting the camera and moving around the camera mount and the angle.<br /><br />At this point we are very comfortable with the hovering going up and the items that really are needed in basic flight.<br /><br />At this point we had learned to bring a couple chairs with us and sit in the field with an obstructed view. On our second day my wife decided she could fly it as well. I was so happy that she got to try it and enjoyed flying it. It kind of made it even more fun for me watching her fly at as opposed to me concentrating on just flying.<br /><br />Another couple days went by and we learned more and more skills. We purchased one of the instant helicopter pads and it worked wonderful. My wife was able to take off at a pretty high speed and come down and land pretty close to the helicopter pad.<br /><br />After our first day of flight we brought on the batteries and plug them in to charge. But unfortunately we did not bring our charging cables with us.<br /><br />So we went home and got our tables and were able to charge the batteries for the next day.<br /><br />We really had a lot more fun on the next day and each day forward.<br /><br />So I truly think it is a great helicopter and has a lot of high-end benefits.<br /><br />I was originally surprised by the compressed Styrofoam carrying case. But I have learned to like that as well. It holds all of the items perfectly.<br /><br />They came with the two batteries and now we have two cables we will keep in the case along with a charger.<br /><br />On my complaint list it would have to be the directions were printed on a microscopic font. But I am older than your average teenager who can read better.<br /><br />So we took photographs of the directions and I was able to see them with my iPad Pro. It was also easier to see him when they are inverted in color.<br /><br />We’ve attached some of the photographs. The videos came out in great quality and the photographs came out and great quality. Taking photographs and sharing them was quite easy.<br /><br />The consul display was easy to follow and once we figure that out we were doing pretty good. We need to complete lesson number three to become more proficient at flying takeoff and landing.<br /><br />All in all we give it thumbs up. Very easy to learn. I can’t wait to explore some more of the Pennsylvania woods.<br /><br />It’ll take some time before I reach the comfort level where I feel comfortable flying around in my neighborhood.<br /><br />So thumbs up. Great value and great price great quality.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HRwG1-1mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HRwG1-1mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HRwG1-1mL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p-sjobXBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p-sjobXBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p-sjobXBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QHNhJPnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QHNhJPnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QHNhJPnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QHNhJPnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QHNhJPnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QHNhJPnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719qzq5brhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719qzq5brhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719qzq5brhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGLRRXH4HUEK5DLUE4SKJWLTPJ5A,1569294858434,240,True

334,5.0,What a Thrill Right Out of The Box! You Will Feel Like A Pro! It's Made To Fly and Have Fun!,"[[VIDEOID:3d06e80d130f86cf3b86663be6d4e8fc]] There are few products or services that get it right. This is one of them. Years ago I bought a drone and it was a small but nicer one. It was hard to fly, hard to control and ended up broken, then repaired but never used again. It was just not fun. Fast forward to today and the Ruko company got it right.<br /><br />I researched for months about what to buy, what would be good for me as a beginner, but as I became more experienced would do what I would want it to do. Well this Ruko drone does all that.<br /><br />When you open the box for the first time, it feels like you are opening something of a much higher priced item. The packaging is sleek and well thought out. The feeling is of an experience, not just opening a product.  Once inside, the drone and its accessories are packages well inside a wonderful foam lined case. Again, you realize that much thought went into every little detail.<br /><br />I followed the instruction for charging the batteries, reviewed the flight instruction as well as the app instructions. Please take your time to review everything, as with me, it was all new.<br /><br />My Son and I took it outside to take our first flight. I was very nervous, like I said the last time I flew a drone, it was a horrifying experience.  We did the initial setup and turned on the motors and WOW!!! It fly to a preset height and just stayed there. No all over the map. Just stayed at the height it was set at. We began to slowly take it through its paces and it did everything it promised it would and more. Again WOW, it was such a pleasure to fly and feel in control.<br /><br />We had it set to beginners mode in the app, we downloaded from the andriod store, as we used an old Moto g6. I could not believe how easy and how much control you have over this great Ruko drone. Again, it has so many features to help you maintain control and if something goes wrong, you hit the ""return home"" button and sure enough, it returns back to you. We tried it and in our case, it landed within 1 foot of where it took off from.<br /><br />For me, I truly am impressed with the quality and feel of this drone. Once you feel more comfortable with the drone, you can switch out of beginners mode and do many other things on your own control. This drone made be feel like a kid again, but also because of the thought that was put into the complete experience of the Ruko drone, I felt like a true polit. I could have fun as well as know that much thought had gone into making it fun, but safe and if an issue would to come about, that it would return to me and not just be lost forever.<br /><br />You do have to register it with the FAA as it is a larger drone, but that took me 5 minutes and I had my number to put on the drone.<br /><br />I have posted a video of our first flight. Again, for once, I feel like I got a product that not only was true to its statements, but went above that and I felt that I had received much more then what I paid for. In todays world, that is normally no the case.<br /><br />Well Done Ruko, Well Done.<br /><br />Thanks for giving my Son and I a great experience and memories of a good time.<br /><br />Glenn",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEXG7QEQFMH2FOYN6PEZZ43HCSJQ,1603386630045,1,True

344,5.0,Deciding between an F11 Pro and a F11 GIM?,"This was the first drone I've ever purchased. Let me start off by saying it was very easy to learn how to use it. You get great instructions with this along with an extra battery, controller, and sturdy carrying case. It only took me about 10 minutes to get used to the features of this drone. When using the app on your phone along with the remote, media is also stored on your mobile device (although, the quality isn't as good as what comes off of the memory card). One downside for me was the fact that this drone only accepts a 32GB memory card. If you're anything like me, you've probably been comparing this drone with the newer F11 GIM. Let me help you out here. As my focus for this purchase was to take great pictures and video, I found the capabilities in that area to be just satisfactory. The F11 Pro takes decent looking video and good images. It does have a bit of the ""fisheye"" going on. That being said, I ended up returning this drone and decided to go for the F11 GIM. I will say, getting used to the flight operation of the GIM took me a little bit longer to get used to. For example, on the F11 Pro, you could rotate the left joy stick and the drone would turn (in place). On the Gim, doing the same action makes the drone turn but it covers a wider area, so you have to pay attention if you're operating it with objects nearby. I wish the GIM shared the precision of movement that the F11 Pro has. The being said, the pictures and video taken on the GIM had me saying ""wow"" when I saw them on my computer. The colors seems to look better as well. The image and video quality is much better on the GIM. I've added two photos, one from the PRO and one from the GIM. These were pulled from my phone but you can see some differences (1st is from the PRO, 2nd is from the GIM)<br /><br />Bottom Line: If your on the market for a great done that gives you a lot of value, with precise controls and is fun to fly, get the F11 Pro. If you're looking for a drone that will take amazing images and video, get the F11 GIM. I hope that helps!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ogZ+NsGwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ogZ+NsGwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ogZ+NsGwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ZcecLSGaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ZcecLSGaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ZcecLSGaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHQHUGGMGY2BOV643DOWD4T3GMDA,1625788646058,3,True

Quite literally, I was flying the F11 Pro within 5 minutes!  It has been a continued pleasure to fly. I am getting much better at flying and using the software during just one and a half hours of flight. Flying is now becoming second nature and I can start focusing on the side of making compelling videos.<br /><br />The drone batteries do last as long as advertised.  The only thing I noticed is that it starts to slow down a little bit after 21 minutes.  Two batteries definitely lasts a long time and is satisfyingly long.  Today, the winds were gusting to 22 mph and the drone continued to fly perfectly stable and controlled. However, you do need to be careful around trees and bear the ground when it is that windy as it takes about a second and a half to stabilize in a really stiff wind – and I mean a stiff wind.<br /><br />This is one of the best recreational things that I have ever purchased.

The unit is well-designed and sturdy, and the case is akin to an ""Apple"" experience when opening.

There are no useful hints on how to unfold the drone, or extend the transmitter features - I had to literally pull, prod, etc. and hope I wasn't breaking something in the process. I found better tutorials via searching and went with those as opposed to the Ruko vid.

369,5.0,Great beginning drone that met my expectations and more.,"The packaging for the F11 Pro drone is very good. The foam insert with cutouts is a great way to store the drone and accessories and offers above average protection to the drone and accessories. The controller is a bit small at first but with practice I found it to be adequate for my needs. I do wish there were a way to use a table rather than a phone for flight only because the larger picture would be more plausible. Other manufacturers provide an aluminum frame that holds the controller and a tablet. Ruko does not (please look at offering such a frame). Connecting the phone to the drone is simple and quick. The app is easy enough to follow. The drone starts quickly (I recommend following the startup procedure in the app - it is easier to follow than the paper guides). Flying the drone is not difficult although I left it in beginner mode and did not attempt difficult procedures. Did I crash? Absolutely. When landing I tried coasting near the ground and the legs caught the grass and flipped the drone. No damage done, just some mud on the top and side of the drone. I definitely need more practice and expect my skills to improve with each outing.

Once you loose video, you can press the return to home button and then cancel once the video reconnects.  The video range depends somewhat on your phone for sure.<br /><br />The images were much better than I expected and I hear they are better if you use a card, which I haven't installed yet.  Took some nice pics of the snowy neighborhood.  The video worked well too.<br /><br />I flew it well under 30 degrees with no problem, but 12 degrees F was too cold. It was unstable and it complained about the battery being low prematurely.  To be fair, this is well under the operating range and ice was starting to form on the body and blades.<br /><br />Is this as good as a DJI in the same price range?  (I don't think there is a DJI in this range.)  I would put it up against a DJI mini fairly well, although the video range and full gimble goes to DJI (it might have other categories as well).  The F11 definitely was quicker than the mini and is heavier, so might not be as vulnerable to the wind.<br />If this is in your price range I don't think you will be disappointed.

I received my drone and with even charging the batteries (the first battery was almost fully charged) I followed the instructions and I was flying in a matter of minutes. I was amazed how easy it was I got well over 20min flight time right out of the box. This drone come with a nice semi hard case extra propellers with a place for every thing to fit nice and secure. The only negative I have for this drone is it will not hold my iPhone X plus in an otterbox  in the phone holder. I was suggest they extend the phone holder to except larger phones.

397,5.0,"Value-packed, Solidly-built, Great for Beginners, Advanced enough to be FUN!","[[VIDEOID:ae89eb0f01731809ae4274c025172a09]] As a first-time drone flyer, I wanted more than ""toy-class"" but didn't want to be intimidated by a steep learning curve. The F11 Pro is sturdy, easy to learn, robust and has many advanced features you usually find on $1k-plus models. Downloaded app from the internet installed it on an unused iPhone & I was flying within minutes! The default beginner mode keeps you out of trouble until you get a handle on flight characteristics. Once it's locked onto GPS, it held steady in moderate winds. The ""return home"" mode works whenever you fly outside of boundaries or when the battery is close to dying (or whenever you want it to come home).<br /><br />The only weak point might be the lack of two-way camera gimbal to stabilize video footage when maneuvering, but for the most part, video is reasonably good when the drone itself is stable in flight. The camera resolution is a bit weird (somewhere between 2K and 4K), but since most users will probably covert the video footage into a more standard format before editing, that's not a big deal, especially at this price level.<br /><br />Bottom line: the F11 Pro is nicely-built, the flight software is easy to learn but has enough ""high-end"" tricks built in to keep you interested, customer service is fast & friendly when you need help, the camera/SD card setup makes footage easy to transfer to computer (it also lets you alternately capture your footage & photos on the cel phone you're using to run the flight control app), and it's robust enough to survive your first few inevitable crashes!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AH3V3HHH2KROMSG5FZ4UEVBPUJ6Q,1582142457811,0,False

408,4.0,Good beginner drone. Fun to use! Pro & Cons,"OVERVIEW: First off, this is a beginner drone! Second: if you are brand new to drones, and aren’t loaded, get a drone like this one as there is a learning curve and risk with drones if you want to push the limits and have some fun with it, which we all want to do. And thirdly: if you are finding the instructions confusing, I would strongly recommend watching a 3rd party YouTuber like captain drone or something.<br /><br />PROS:<br />•Fun<br />•Fast<br />•Responsive controls<br />•Lots of fun features for a beginner drone<br />•Price/quality - it’s a well made drone, it survived a 30 foot fall after hitting a tree pretty well, the blades were slightly scuffed up<br />•Prettt good 2k camera<br /><br />CONS:<br />•Title is misleading about the battery life. This is something that frustrates me more than anything, if you put 60 minute fly time in your title, that implies that you can stay in the air for roughly 60 minutes right? Well no. You get roughly 60 minutes between the 2 batteries you get. So 25 min/ea is a safe bet if there is low wind and you aren’t racing it non-stop. This is the thing that dropped my review from a 5 to a 4. I want complete honesty in things like this. It’s like saying your new electric car can go 800 miles, but they don’t tell you that that means swapping out your battery half way which they’ve included.<br />•Range is not the advertised range. I think 4000ft is what is advertised, which is a little less than a mile. This goes no where near that range. Maybe 1000? I’m not sure.<br />•Instructions can be a little confusing - again go watch a YouTube video on the drone to make it easy.<br /><br />CLOSING: fun drone, I’m in my mid 20s and I’m having a blast with this. You may be tempted to get yourself a mavic pro 2 or something because that’s what all the youtubers will say. If you are brand new, don’t do it!! There is too much risk. And I doubt you are going to insure your drone. Make sure you are going to stay committed to your “videography” career before you go all out on a high end one.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHLGZWUAC7P43VPKNUEGT5LNORCA,1572537330649,1,False

It could be for beginners as well, and while the price point is a great value, it might scare some users who spend less and end up not happy with their drone. This is very easy to learn and control with its auto start and return feature, very long battery, latest 4k technology, and GPS with follow me which are all the top features a great drone should have. Each battery lasts about 25 minutes of fly time and there are two batteries included. They charge fast and full in a couple of hours so you could continuously charge through while flying. The drone itself has a brushless motor which is what you would see in top tools for its durability and quality. It has a bunch of advanced features like adjusting camera angle, GPS hold, GPS map points, circle an area, 5gz connection and comes with extra propellers. You do have to connect it to your phone trough their app which gives you the full ability to control and access the extra features, while the joystick remains for the controls. The app is easy to use and navigate through. It fold up as it should and fits a very nice lightweight foam case. The picture and video quality are better than I expected at this price even for 4k.  For a good fraction of the top drone price, it definitely gives the Mavic a run for its money. I would definitely recommend this to any level drone user and is a very good value at the price point.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61atAjMzL8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61atAjMzL8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61atAjMzL8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hbNTkTRlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hbNTkTRlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hbNTkTRlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEFXBYTFC7GO3QU3KRELTF7BPJ2Q,1567138646784,71,True

But if you go at slowly it's remarkable.  Still having a camera problem but maybe due to using a 64G sd card. I will have a 32G tomorrow. Flies great. Pretty study and can take a beating. (come with spare wings if needed.). Get the spare front landing legs.  They are the weakest thing on it, IMO.  Using with phone application is great fun. Range is better than rated. Not sure on battery charge length, but so far no problem. (comes with spare battery also.)  Carry case is nice. Several videos on YOU TUBE and even on the phone ap. Watch them all several times.  I can't imagine one better for the price. EMAIL support was also prompt and accurate , (but in rough English.)  :)  A better translated user guide would make this thing a perfect 5.  Haven't spent a lot of time with all the available functions, but so far they have been great.<br />Update:  My camera works great now. You MUST use a 32G card.

First of all I posted the first so quick because I was told by the seller if I gave them five stars and positive comments they would send me a third battery for FREE.<br />I have received the FREE battery now my TRUE feelings about this drone<br /><br />I LOVE IT. As a middle age man who has every toy in the world. I am having tons of fun. Crashing it while taking videos is a blast. I have rigged up a remote control release and it will lift a raw egg and I can drop it from 100 feet.

442,5.0,Worth the $$,Very good drone pretty easy to fly. Only a few things i dont like. One is the camera does not go all the way up to point straight. Second is it loses camera signal about 6-800 feet away. Other than that it flys good and fun to fly. Its fast and has lots of things it can do i havent got to try everything it does yet. I really out does some of the drones in its categories and cheaper. The camera is one plus side it has a very wide angle and good resolution.

448,1.0,"Well, so far so bad......","First, I've flown other drones (Mavik, mavik mini) that friends and relatives have and decided to try this out.  After watching many videos and seeing positive reviews of the F11 pro i ordered it.  received yesterday and took it out 1st time today.  Sunny day a few clouds slight breeze (3-4 mph).  After running the setup, connecting to WiFi, opening the app everything seemed to be going well.  I began carefully by just doing auto launch and was working fine.  I did minor moves at 20 ft, within a distance of about 50-75 ft.  Was getting used to the controls and the app after about 15 mins.  suddenly clouded up a bit and the wind started to kick up to maybe 5-7 mph.  Decided it was enough for the first flight so I used the return to home to make sure it worked.  I was working fine, seemed to handle the wind fine.  Just as it was coming in to land, about 3 inches from the ground there was a sudden wind gust and the drone tipped a bit to the left and propellers on that side hit the sidewalk and the unit flipped over and landed updside down !!! :(  After picking it up, there was no visible damage except for some cosmetic damage on the propellers that had hit the sidewalk.  Turned everything off and took the unit inside for awhile.  about an hour later the day was back to as before, clouds gone, sunny, slight breeze so I took it back out to check everything.  Bad news.  Everything seemed to initialize (compass, gps, wifi) but the camera would not display anything in FPV.  Also, the camera would not rotate via the controller.  It just stayed in the same place no matter what.  Camera basically dead.  Naturally had to send this back and had to decide whether to get replacement or refund.  Decided to get a replacement, hopefully this was just a one off issue.  Will have to see.  I will update this review on the new unit after it is received.  If I have other issues will just have to get a refund and look at a different drone.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHUFEYGTMIMYC54NBT3BDKU2OFZA,1594333819257,16,True

450,5.0,EXCELLENT Beginner Drone!,"if you've read any of my reviews, you know that I like to wait until the 'new car smell' wears off to write them so I can give a more honest picture of how happy (or unhappy) you will be with this purchase. So, here is my take on the RUKO F11 drone.<br />I am not a professional user of drones. Far from it-- I am an absolute rookie, so please understand that my perspective is based on a limited set of expectations. When this product came up on a pre-Christmas price drop, I checked the reviews for any pattern of bad juju and, Seeing none, too the plunge. I am VERY happy I did! Here were my factors for selection, all of which have proven to be accurate for this drone:<br />-Ease of use. Both I and my 10 year old had no trouble learning the basics. The instructions are clear and usable.<br />-Feature packed. This is a LEGIT drone. I has most of the advanced features you will find on a much pricier unit. I am still learning some of them, but they are all explained clearly, so... start having fun and learn as you go!<br />-Good camera! This is a 4K camera, so it takes beautiful pics and video.<br />-Sturdy, with a qualifier. It is well made, but this is a sensitive electronic device designed to be light weight, so don't let the dog play with it.<br />-Good battery life. It'll stay in the air for a good while. If you are working it hard, you'll kill the battery faster (duh) , but it will stay up pretty close to the stated 30 mins if you are conservative with it. It comes with two batteries (good) but they do take a while to charge back up, so if you need a LOT of hang time you may wish to buy an extra. They charge with a regular old mini USB instead of a dedicated charger, so you can have multiple batteries charging simultaneously. The controller lasts a long time and charger fairly quickly.<br />-Carrying case is nice. I'd pay extra for the case that comes with this unit (but I'm glad I didn't)<br />-Comes with parts. Haven't broken anything yet, but it is inevitable. The drone came with a bunch of blades.<br />-Does well in the wind! Surprisingly, a good breeze is not a problem for this thing!<br />In sum, So far I have nothing bad to day about this unit. I hope this review helps you with your decision.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHYKO3E6AKEISI673KRT4U7Q4TUA,1609371259928,0,True

The pictures are clear and for my use I couldn't see investing in a more expensive one to learn on.<br />The flight time has been between 20-25 minutes although I'm still trying to sort out why the controller charge indicates a low battery despite being fully charged before a flight.  The drone comes with 2 batteries so hopefully the controller charge thing is just something I am doing wrong.<br />This is supposed to be the same drone as the SJRC F-11 which can be purchased for less money but the Ruko brand has great customer support and as with many Chinese products it seems like there are quality differences between two products that look identical so I went with this one,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41OHRjtpWRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41OHRjtpWRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41OHRjtpWRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NzWHS2JwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NzWHS2JwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61NzWHS2JwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEQ476HCKNQ4Q4GHUWS5SUUXCG3A,1581353923179,0,True

I took it out of the box, followed the clear instructions, charged all the batteries, and was ready to test it the next day. My primary purpose for purchasing it was to use it to see things in the 500 acres of trees we farm, particularly the location of beavers that destroy the trees and feral hogs that do extensive damage to the landscape. I've been practicing in a clear area, and I'm almost to the point that I'm ready to move out to various areas of the farm; the condensed instructions are very helpful as I fly the drone. I also appreciate the relatively long battery life (30 minutes) and the crystal clear pictures/videos I get with it. I often say when I buy equipment that it'd be nice if things worked as advertised--this drone does!<br />What would I change to make it even more useful? I'd add a small light in the center of the back so I'd always be able to see the orientation of drone; I'm going to add reflective tape. Of course, I'd prefer cheaper replacement rotary blades, but cost is comparable with other brands.<br />I highly recommend the drone; based on my experience to date, I don't think you can go wrong with it!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHUZ5YPJKSSVR5FAPTY6BYYD2VLQ,1621893817764,0,True

The camera is not the best you can get of course, but it still took great photos and videos that I share on Facebook and Youtube. The GPS works very well, and keeps the drone stable in flight and when hovering. It's fairly light, so strong winds do move it around a bit, but it self-corrects itself with little effort.

495,5.0,A fun and simple to use drone,"It is a fun first drone to have. It is easy to use and has lots of helpful features to make your first flights as smooth and as safe as possible. I live in a mountains region and during my first flight the wind picked up drastically. Enough to overpower the drone preventing it from using its auto home feature. When the power finally died mid flight, we went to look for it using the gps last know location feature. Since the drone died before it touched down, its last know location wasn't close enough to were it landed. Untimely we couldn't find the drone and I reached out to the Ruko support line. They got back to me very quickly and once I sent them the flight logs of the drone that went missing, they were able to send me a replacement. The replacement was definitely an older model (slightly heavier and uses micro usb instead of type-c) but I wouldn't be able to tell while flying it.<br /><br />Now that I have hard more experience with the drone I can say that it is pretty great! The controls aren't as tight as I would like but they are very intuitive and easy to pick up. Safety features like auto landing and distance limiters work great even under less then ideal circumstances. Just keep an eye on the weather. If you start having issues with either of those safety features, it's likely the result of external factors and you should try to land immediately.<br /><br />I would definitely recommended this as a fun first recitational drone.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGSFPU2WIKEPK3E2E5MO57VSZHMQ,1671380818865,3,True

I have never used the joy stick controllers in games or anything like that before (I'm old and ""old school"").  After reading all the great reviews and watching numerous YouTube videos highlighting this RUKO F11 Pro drone, I took the plunge.  I had it for 5 months before I even tried to fly it.  When I finally did, I was disappointed that the SD card in the drone wasn't capturing photos or videos.  I knew the camera was working as the images were being captured in the RUKO PRO APP and on my cell phone.  But I wanted to be able to take the SD card and view the images on my larger screen laptop.  After changing out 3 different 32 GB FAT32 formatted SD cards, I was at my wits end.  Finally, I emailed RUKO customer service with my problem.  I fully explained all the steps I had taken up to that point.  The friendly (and fast responding) Customer Service team determined that the drone was not communicating with the SD card correctly.  They sent me a replacement camera at no charge.  It arrived in a matter of days.  (I was afraid I would have to wait months seeing as how these things were made in China.)<br /><br />I can't say enough about the great response I got from RUKO Customer Service.

505,4.0,"Very good Drone, many variations, and that is part of the problem","By many variations, I am serious that the vendor is selling so many versions of this chassis and software that the Quick Operation Guide (in the lid of the box) lists the use of ""SJ GPS PRO_XXXX"" instead of the complete manual that states that you use the ""RUKO PRO"" app. The software differences are extreme! That was the first problem since ALL of the similar units set up and find GPS the same way.<br /><br />Second, The instructions don't warn you not to use an older Android Version like v8.0 which my ASUS phone that I was going to use uses. They just warn that it won't work unless you have WIFI for 5g (not 2.4g). I struggled for over an hour trying to get the Drone to show video, and stay connected to the Drone. The phone is totally stable on my home WIFI 5g - Not the drone. I would have taken off two stars if I knew better to start with - I take some responsibility for not figuring it out.<br />Also, the software interface uses different icons to enable the advanced features depending on what 'version' of the Pro app you use. Initially, my phone kept dropping out of connection further exacerbating the issue!<br /><br />Third, the app uses one icon that looks a lot like the GPS return icon that buries 8 different functions and the manual initially only addresses this as 'More Functions'. I tried for 30 minutes to find the Waypoint flight. It is ONE of these 8 functions!<br /><br />Fourth, I just noticed that the Take Off button tells the Drone to take off and hover at about 5 ft  - well on my slightly inclined driveway ended up more like 8 -10ft. Good thing I didn't assume I could do that indoors, or my ceiling fans would have eaten the Drone!<br /><br />I am sure I will find out more, but these are my observations in Beginners Mode after 2 hours of struggle. I think after killing two batteries and loading two Apps that I can now set up Waypoints and film a surround view of my home roof (preparing for Solar).<br /><br />Update: The Drone works great when you know how to find the Waypoints section. Will try now some of the advanced features. We are in a very wooded area, and flight is precarious, so I use even more caution. But if the Gyros and Compass are set properly, the Drone will hover perfectly while you get your act together!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFSLELNLKNT7IIOQODGVP55TITBA,1631668569951,1,True

It weighs over the 250 gram limit (519 grams) meaning in the US you have register it with the FAA which is $5... no biggie.<br />The remote has a press trick to turn off. This is so you don't accidentally just turn off remote in flight. The recording app will record on the micro sd card plus on your phone. The recording on the micro sd is 2K while the recording on the cell phone will be 720p. App also has a starter mode that you can later change. Controller feels nice in the hands. It barely holds my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus with case.<br />Very powerful to withstand high winds with the brush less massive motors yet very quiet.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Comes with 2 Batteries. Battery life is over 25 minutes (depends on wind speeds and your speed settings)<br />2. Remote is rechargeable<br />3. GPS, return home, low battery warning, launch/land feature<br />4. Camera Quality is crazy good on micro sd card<br />5. WiFi distance and controller distance is insane!<br />6. Build quality is very high<br />7. Camera moves to face straight down from remote<br />8. Comes with nice carry case<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Batteries take around 4 hours to fully charge<br />2. Hard to tell front from back while in the air so I added orange eagle sticker which you can see on the video and pic","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FzCXOfPZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FzCXOfPZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FzCXOfPZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MuJVtEGpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MuJVtEGpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MuJVtEGpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AG3KPJRADEH2E4JKVBV3HIL7R4EQ,1579649056669,97,True

522,5.0,Fun drone for a beginner,"This is my 3rd drone and I'm finally glad I spent a little more money to have something that is easy to learn with.  My first drone was a micro drone that was a nightmare to control and the second was similar in size to this Ruko, but it did not hover well, was not easy to control and it would take off if it lost control, which it did once and was only saved from flying off into the deep woods by a tree top pulling the battery back out before it left my property.  This drone hovers in place very well and seems to handle wind pretty good too.  I brought out for the 2nd time today and got a little brave with it on a mildly windy day and it wasn't too bad down low, but I brought it up a bit too high and got a little nervous as it seemed to be caught in some pretty strong winds up over the tree line.  I was able to get it back under control and all was well.  I have taken a few pictures so far and one came out pretty nice with my son testing the gesture feature.  The sun wasn't out much today so the rest of the pictures were clear, but dull due to the lack of light.  The gesture feature I have found to be less than responsive so far, but I will keep playing with it.<br /><br />Over all I'm happy and can't wait to enjoy some more flying time.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHUBRW7XXWQ2CVX2553KQIF56IPQ,1606016915897,0,True
523,5.0,Great drone,Best birthday gift ever! Very easy to get started and learn to fly. I really enjoy the speed setting while I am getting used to the controls. Very stable and takes great photos.,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFRHWWA5R6KLZYXYFPZJ5BNBV2EA,1603071839767,0,False
524,5.0,Professional grade drone at beginner/toy price!,"I've owned five drones and I'm extremely impressed by this drone over all the others.<br /><br />The pictures I've attached are taking off at maybe 30m, view looking straight down from about 100m high during daylight, and skyline at night at about 120m (max height allowable by FAA).  Do note it was pretty windy up at 120m the night I took that picture.  These are just the ones that were sent to my phone; pictures saved to the SD card are of higher quality.<br /><br />Pros: Outstanding power - this drone can fight, and win, against light and moderate wind!  The app even tells you when the wind conditions are getting dangerous for flight!  Well done.<br />Folding profile and carrying case is extremely well done - over and beyond convenient.  Folding arms snap into place, so they aren't going to jostle out of alignment during flight.  Case is soft yet protective; no trouble fitting it in a backpack and hiking along with it.<br />ABS plastic + reinforced aluminum frame means this thing is durable and built to last.<br />Using the 5GHz wireless signal and my phone I've gotten steady real time video transmission from over 300m away and 120m high, consistently, without losing connection.  That's impressive at this price point!<br />Return to home/GPS is ALWAYS spot on; you can count on this drone coming back exactly to you!  Major plus.<br />This really does fly for up to 30 minutes as advertised.  This will of course depend on wind, speed setting, and how aggressively you're flying it though, so your flight time will be influenced by your conditions and flight pattern.<br />Extremely responsive controls, and steady enough flight to get quality pictures and video.  Three speed modes; I like to put it on the lowest speed setting once it gets close to the ground for landing, or when I'm steadying it to take a picture relatively close up.  Putting it on max speed and racing it around is a blast too.<br />This drone uses 5GHz band to connect with your phone wirelessly.  This is good; better video quality and better signal transmission means you can communicate with it from further distances without being crowded by numerous 2.4GHz signals usually in any given area these days.  You want this over 2.4GHz for a wireless connection to your phone.  (Of course the pictures and video are saved to the SD card, but for maintaining a good real time image and connectivity you want the 5GHz channel.)<br />I really can't recommend this enough; skip the toys and get this - it's worth every dollar of the price!<br /><br />Cons:<br />I have to nit-pick here, and there's not much to dislike.  These are very minor points I include to make this review fair and unbiased.<br />It is loud; not at all hearing unsafe or offensive, but it is noticeable compared to a toy-grade drone.  Any drone with this much power (read: not strictly a toy) is going to make some noise.  It is not offensive though; you won't bother the neighbors.<br />The camera has a slight fish-eye effect when you're trying to look straight ahead.  You can see that in the first picture I posted and the nighttime picture.  Do note the camera is in-flight adjustable, so you can go from straight ahead to straight down, and all points in between, on the fly.  So big plus for that.  I can't knock the camera too much because it doesn't have a stabilizing gimble.  That's a necessary trade to fit the profile.  Plus if you're watching the ground at an angle the fish-eye effect goes away.<br />It can be just a bit slow to get a GPS lock.  Don't be put off though; it's not difficult to obtain one, it just takes a couple extra seconds.  It never loses the GPS signal once it's got it.  (So you can hold it up high to get a signal quicker, then set it down for takeoff.)<br />You do have to register it with the FAA (it just barely meets their weight requirement for registration).  Don't be put off: this process takes less than 5 minutes on their website, and there's zero waiting on paperwork.  Just fill out the form and you're ready to fly immediately (register as a modeler/recreational flyer and you're good to go with no hassle).<br /><br />Tips:<br />Disconnect your phone from any wireless networks it is auto-joining.  This will ensure you maintain a video feed to your phone as you fly greater distances away.<br />Android users: when you connect to this wireless signal, you have to tell Android OS to keep connected even though there is no internet connectivity.  This is a quirk of the Android OS, not the drone.  Be sure to do this the first time you connect to the drone and you'll be fine.<br />To get a GPS signal quickly, calibrate the compass and the gyroscope as per the included instructions then hold the drone up off the ground while it searches for a GPS signal.  You'll get the necessary 3 bars of signal much faster than sitting flat on the ground.  (Also note - to unlock the motor to take off you must have 3 bars of GPS signal!  If your drone motor is not unlocking for take off, this is why.  Do not fly without GPS mode!  You'll be thankful when your drone is auto-returning to the takeoff location from who knows where you've flown it - trust me!)  Then just set it back down, unlock the motor, and take off.<br />On the geo-fencing feature, set the auto-return minimum height high enough to clear any trees in your immediate area.  That way, when auto-returning, it will climb safely over the height of any trees between the initial location and the drone's current position.  This will avoid crashing into anything on its automated return path.<br /><br />Overall verdict: this has all of the features of more expensive, professional grade, drones at (if you catch it on sale as I did) an entry level/toy price point.  Buy this.  Grab an extra battery - you'll need it to feed your addiction!  I can't imagine how fun this will be using VR glasses in first person view.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pME5XUEpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pME5XUEpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pME5XUEpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EXjfHzm9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EXjfHzm9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EXjfHzm9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NZi4CPVVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NZi4CPVVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NZi4CPVVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGULLOKV7H7BK3O7A2255ZX6UEXA,1580131028301,189,True

538,2.0,Awesome drone! (Edited),"So I unfortunately need to update this review to reflect an issue I started to experience. I got the free battery that ruko gives out for fair reviews.  Everything was working good, up until my phone updated to Android 10, after that I started to notice some odd issues. Like I couldn't get a GPS or camera lock at start, its as if the software/controller and the drone would not connected.  I tested again later from another location, and after some futzing and calibrating several times I got it to lock and engage the camera. But when I took it up and started to fly I noticed the controls were all messed up. I could fly forward and back and side to side, but when I rotated and hit forward the controls would move me left or right instead of forward or back. The support person I spoke to said this was because it was in headless mode, but I didn't engage that. I even reset the drone/controller and tried it again and it did the same thing. With that I decided to trade it in. I'm reluctant to try a replacement based on that experience as it seems like the software on Android 10 note 10+ isn't ironed out. On Android 9, I didn't experience any issues, it connected and worked well. I'd be curious to know if others experienced odd things with the software on android 9 or 10.<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />This is my first drone ever and really like it so far. It's super easy to fly, practically flies on its own with a little assistance from me. I've played with the sub $50 dollar drone toys and enjoyed them, well for 6-7 minutes before needing to charge. This got tedius and boring after so much time spent charging. One of the major attractions to this drone is the battery life/flight time. I got about 25 min before it started to blink, which I'm sure I could've squeezed out that 5 min, but didn't want to risk it. It's durable, I tried flying inside and hit the couch, it crashed and I saw a small indent on one blade. So I don't recommend any indoor flight with this. Like others have stated, i think it would be the best drone if they included a collision sensor. Other than that, this is a great quality drone. I'm really liking all the more advanced features like the follow me option is great to record the family out having fun at the park. So far I have nothing but great things to say about the Ruko F11 Drone. I will continue to use it and will report here of any issues.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AETSFVD3S2UHFR4ZYZNEIVTJEKGA,1577486697565,7,True

542,5.0,Easy to operate,"This is my first drone, it was very easy to pick up and learn how to use right away. After some quick reading of the manual, and after following the intuitive calibration instructions, I was flying all around my neighborhood in no time. The features work surprisingly well. The tracking of the software allows for easy use of the active track and hand gesture feature.

550,2.0,Camera motion very inconsistent,"I bought this drone because it was written up in an article as being one of the top affordable drones for home inspections. For home inspections the camera is really important. Right out of the box the drone was easy to operate but I quickly noticed that the camera was stuck in the down position. I landed the drone and followed the trouble shooting guide and managed to get about 30 degrees of motion with the camera. Unacceptable. I called the numbers provided for technical support and only got an answering machine that said ""the google subscriber is unavailable, please leave a message"". It gave me no indication that I had reached Ruko. I left a message and a day later I received a call from Ruko and they promptly sent me a new replacement camera. It was easy enough to replace. When I flew the drone and tested the camera I had the full 90 degrees (up & down) of motion but it was very jerky. When I went to point the camera up or down it would get stuck about halfway down and then suddenly snap into motion which made for jerky, clunky video. To make matters worse, it would not move at all on other flights. Knowing that the camera was not gimbaled was not super important for me but with the motion of the camera being rough as it is I decided to send this back. For home inspections I don't need anything fancy but the camera needs to be smooth and reliable.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEVJCRMSRPGXLXEDVBQ22XVLOOLQ,1597582793835,3,True

576,5.0,Very well made and so much more than I expected in this price range,"[[VIDEOID:761e6e011b0e8b2abc7b732575cbdafb]] I feel it's important to explain how I came to buy the F11 PRO Drone.  Several weeks back I got suckered into purchasing a drone that was advertised on Facebook.  It was an elaborate video about how some engineer at a big name brand company realized the company he worked for was purchasing lower valued electronics but charging a high brand name cost to cover advertising.  So he left the brand name company and started his own with a few of his co-workers offering the same high quality electronics at a fraction of the cost because they aren't spending money on marketing.  But I need to buy it now because this price won't last long after the word gets out about how great it is.<br /> It looked like a lot of fun and now I had to have it.  so I ordered it right after the advertisement ended. I know it was a compulsive purchase because before seeing the video I had never thought about having a drone. Whatever, I'm only human.  Now I was excited to get this awesome drone in the mail.  I waited and waited and waited, several weeks for it to finally arrive.  I had never seen a drone before but even I could tell  it seemed really light in weight and cheaply made.  Trying not to deflate my excitement so quickly, I rationalized with myself thinking maybe it has to be light in order to fly.  I very quickly learned that was not the case.  The supposed high quality drone couldn't even get off the ground.  When I contacted the seller about it. They told me to shake it up and down to get it working. OMG are you kidding me???  Long story short it never worked.  After being let down by the drone scam, I did some research and found the F11 PRO on Amazon.  It had great reviews and was still very reasonably priced.  So I ordered it. Unlike the other bogus drone, the F11 PRO was delivered almost immediately.  No waiting at all this time and no letting me down this time either.  The difference between the two drones is night and day.  The F11 PRO is sturdy, weighty, very well made and has so many cool functions i haven't even begun to master them all yet.  In one of the pictures above you can see the two drones side by side.  The little one is the cheap knock-off I got scammed into purchasing from a Facebook advertisement and the larger drone is the F11 PRO right out of the box.  EVERYTHING is better on the F11 PRO than the cheap piece of crap advertised on Facebook.  I was talking to a friend of mine who is also a beginner.  He told me he had received the Mavic drone as a Christmas gift a year or two ago.  The funny part is he's afraid to fly it because he hasn't gotten insurance for it yet.  It's so expensive he feels the need to insure it before even attempting to fly it?  That's just silly.  The F11 has many of the same features as the Mavic and if I happen to crash it due to my limited knowledge in flying?  I'll just buy another one because they're priced so I can.  I don't see that happening because the GPS and other features on the F11 PRO prevent it from crashing. Even If you'r a beginner.  Why spend thousands on a drone? You can get the same high quality experience and just as much fun with the F11 PRO.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  You don't need to research anymore or think about it anymore.  Just buy it and you can thank me later.<br /><br />It's been a few days since I wrote my review.  Since then I've been learning more about this drone every day.  It hasn't ceased to amaze me.  Every person who has seen me flying this drone, said....I have to get one!! This thing flies so high it's hard to believe even when you're looking at it with your own two eyes.  I've added a couple pics and a video I took with the drone.  The video may be a little bumpy in some parts but that's all on me.  I just turned on the video to see how it worked?  I was still having fun flying it around.  Zipping from one place to another,  rather than paying attention to the filming.  It still took some great footage.  I'm looking forward to putting together some really nice photography & video shots with this drone.  So there ya have it.  After a few days I'm still loving it.  As a matter of fact I bought another one for my wife because she was jealous of mine...LOL","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Oh4eO17qL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Oh4eO17qL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Oh4eO17qL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZahZSaYhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZahZSaYhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZahZSaYhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81luPrnWUVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81luPrnWUVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81luPrnWUVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vDVSpD5QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vDVSpD5QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vDVSpD5QL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91reHy+zOgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91reHy+zOgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91reHy+zOgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEBSWRITUJ3CUOF4I2LNWQLBTWRA,1580197266416,27,True

Once I got it calibrated I easily got it in the air and flying.  The first trip I had the beginner limits on so I was limited in my flight range.  The second fly I extended the range by turning off the beginner limits and took it out to around 130m distance - no where near its range.

606,4.0,** Fanstastic Beginner Drone **,"This is my first drone.  I'm not going to lie when I say shopping for your first drone isn't easy.  There are so many to choose from based on price, reviews, skillset, etc.  I had originally purchased the Holy Stone 270, as it's essentially the same drone but about $100 cheaper.  After needing to send the first one (and the second) back to Amazon because the remote control would not hold a charge, I finally settled on the Roku F11.  I was a little nervous because it's the same remote control.  But lo! this one works just fine. :) I was prompted to purchase this one for an extra $100 because it comes with an extra battery as well.  For a beginner user I want to be able to get up in the air as much as possible for practice.  It was nice to know I had an whole extra battery and 25min for extra flight time (total, darn near close to an hour) to really play and get to know my drone.<br /><br />First impressions:<br />1. Sturdy carry case and well protected.  I like that if I'm traveling.<br />2. 2 batteries a huge plus<br />3. Sturdy drone and surprisingly heavier than I expected with the battery installed.  It's not a cheaply built drone.  Well made.<br />4. Downloading the app and setting up the drone for first flight - super simply.  Less than 10 minutes.<br />5. The auto take off feature is really nice. One button launch and you're in the air hovering.<br />6. The return to home feature is a life saver for a beginner.  First time using the RTH feature and the drone landed about 10"" away from the launch pad.  That's pretty good!  Though I got the hang of the remote control pretty quick and probably could have landed the drone myself on my first time out.<br />7.  Took some quick same footage.  In the daylight, it's hard to see my phone's screen to see what the drone is seeing.  But that's not an error with the drone.<br />8.  Don't be discouraged from the photo quality on the Amazon reviews.  I was really shocked at how nice and crisp the photos are.  I wonder if Amazon has a rez limit.  I think they look really good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  My first time out, so I can't really say much at this point, but I thought the drone would do a little better in the wind.  10mph + winds today.  Drone did struggle to fly against it.  It worked fine, but with effort.<br />2.  Attempted to leave the drone hover, and again, shocked it would pretty well stay in place even with the wind.  Just going straight into the direction of the breeze is where it hurts the most.<br /><br />One last thing, on final landing (during my first flight experience) I did forget how to have the drone auto land and I accidentally turned the drone off completely and it fell to the ground.  Thank god it was already hovering about 18"" from the ground when I did so.  Even still, dusted off the dry dirt and the drone and propellars took no damage.<br /><br />I would personally recommend anyone on a budget to purchase this drone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716JcoptvwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716JcoptvwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716JcoptvwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nGhc1gomL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nGhc1gomL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nGhc1gomL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81b8U5MKyhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81b8U5MKyhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81b8U5MKyhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fDTAwmSGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fDTAwmSGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fDTAwmSGL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFLGESWSRBUNUY4IJZ34V3MKO4CQ,1591641365106,0,True

Very prompt and friendly responses.  I’ve had the drone for a little over a week now and I’m still impressed. Flight time is as advertised about 25 minutes for each battery.

It has very good Construction and  not cheesy. The motors are very powerful and it flies very well in windy conditions. All the features work very well and had a great experience with it. I did have some technical difficulties where it fell from the sky I think I may have hit the disconnect button or something but Roku customer service support is very awesome they sent me some replacement parts at no cost to me and it runs very well. I am a beginner with drones. Also the remote control was very user-friendly. The video quality is excellent especially on the 32GB SD card I put in the Drone that's 4K it also record simultaneously to your phone as well. Mine came with two batteries and a great case. The flight time was awesome it was over 25 minutes it felt like a long time. The GPS return home function work every time Also you can rotate the camera 90° straight down with the remote control. The only thing I didn't like was the battery charge time it takes about 4 hours to charge when it's completely dead. But if you need more flight time than 45 to 50 minutes Roku also sell extra batteries.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PJWskvmdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PJWskvmdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PJWskvmdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g6xWj8idL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g6xWj8idL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71g6xWj8idL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fhLRQkjZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fhLRQkjZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fhLRQkjZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xHy40kbyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xHy40kbyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xHy40kbyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGPLP2XIUMJQRFTV2ANQX2HBS7CQ,1603807957665,0,True
647,5.0,Great for beginners and experience pilots. A great price with great features.,"[[VIDEOID:8bcf16cb4315044080444b68ba008e1a]] Great drone for beginners and experienced this is my first drone, it is very easy to fly. I like how the controller folds up and also has a spot to hold your cell phone so you can see the video from the drone on it. I believe the video recording is 2.9 k and if you take pictures the camera is 4k. It comes with two batteries and the option to leave a review for a third battery for free. It also has headless mode which means you can go back and forth and left to right and it will be easier to control the drone in headless mode. And normal mode depending on the direction of where the camera is on the drone that would be your front and if you move around you could make it go in the wrong direction but after a few test flights you should be able to get it down very easily. I still have mine in beginner mode. I've flown it four or five times just shortly and last night is the first time I've recorded video on it. You don't have to use but I installed an SD card into the drone so every picture and video recording gets stored on board. If you don't have an SD card then everything gets stored on your phone, I actually think that it stores to your phone no matter what but the SD card might possibly always be running I'll have to check that out. it's great and once I figured out all these features which will take some time to learn them all you can do all types of things with the drone. It has follow me mode, it can circle around a location, you can set waypoints on the app on your phone so we can automatically fly to those spots that you choose and it also has hand gestures which I have not personally tried myself but I guess you can use them to start videos or to take a picture. The drone goes up almost 4000 ft although I believe you can only see the live video for 500 meters I believe the specification said. I think if you start the recording for video when you take off and you go above the 500 m it will still record for you right onto your SD card and I think that's really what the SD card option is for in case you lose the video feed on your cell phone when flying. For this price range in the quality of the video and pictures this drone is a excellent option. The only thing I wish it had that it doesn't is obstacle avoidance. But you won't find that feature on any other drone for less than $1,000. You don't really want to get it out of your line of sight anyway though just for the chance of the drone running into something that you cannot see like power lines or something else. I'm very happy with this drone. The video I have posted isn't the best. It's the first time I've used the camera and video option and it was dark out and very cold. I had the app set to beginner mode so my range was limited. I could have flown a lot higher and farther.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711X+U-JdKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711X+U-JdKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711X+U-JdKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714feZIikOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714feZIikOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714feZIikOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715GTUcZj4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715GTUcZj4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715GTUcZj4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K6y5iqbdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K6y5iqbdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K6y5iqbdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ciGtK8iUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ciGtK8iUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ciGtK8iUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eWoRCVkFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eWoRCVkFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eWoRCVkFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aGH9PMknL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aGH9PMknL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aGH9PMknL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j-U5jCsJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j-U5jCsJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j-U5jCsJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHYMPPP2ROQ7MGKIM237QL4J55AQ,1604853052934,2,True

657,4.0,Surpisingly decent little drone,"This little drone surprised me at how good it is for the price. It's my first drone, and it got me interested enough in them to buy another one with better features.<br /><br />Flight time is pretty good, RTH works great, distance is pretty good, and the drone is responsive.<br /><br />My complaints are as follows.<br /><br />The biggest complaint is that you can only connect your phone via wifi. Sometimes it takes my phone a long time to find it, or I'll have to shut the drone off and turn it back on to get it to show up, and it likes to disconnect fairly frequently. But when it's working, it works good. The option to use a cable from the remote to the phone would be wonderful, and this was one of the compelling reasons driving me to purchase another (but much more expensive) drone.<br /><br />Another complaint is that sometimes if you crash or even just land, the drone thinks it's still in flight and there is no way to shut down the motors. The poor thing will sit there, sometimes on it's side or upside down, trying it's hardest to spin the propellers and there's nothing you can do about it other than stick a hand or foot or something into the spinning blades to rectify the situation.<br /><br />I wish the app would remember your settings. You can turn off beginner mode and it will stay off, but every time you go to use it you will hit max distance within 10 seconds and have to stop, go into settings, and change max distance, max height, and RTH height to your preferences again.<br /><br />Don't even think about flying this indoors. With GPS turned off this thing will not hover in place. It's always moving. I can fly it great outdoors very easily but I can't fly it for more than 5 seconds inside without getting a wall or something and crashing.<br /><br />All in all you get a lot for the money with this thing. The photos are pretty decent and it does about everything you could ask it to do. I think the level 7 wind claims are BS, but I expected that considering some of the top recommended drones out there in this category are level 5 winds.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFLONXVK7NCVP6DOW4UBOZEZITCQ,1640546946203,0,False

662,4.0,Great quality for the price - until it stopped recording.  Easy to fly.,"[[VIDEOID:a3102b41b76ad188ece21c248049c64c]] UPDATE: 2/15/20.  The Ruko F11 unfortunately stopped recording and I lost some irreplaceable footage, which really upset me.<br /><br />I was just inside the return window by a few days, so I returned the drone and was refunded.<br /><br />THIS is important:  I decided to purchase a DJI MAVIC MINI drone, which is 2.7k, and does not have all of the features of the F11, such as follow me, BUT has a gimble - which makes the video butter smooth.  The BIG deal is that the lense on the DJI is such superior quality that the video image is MUCH better than the F11.  Crystal clear.  Quality is noteably higher, it is easier to fly and quickly and automatically calibrated the compass to GPS.  Just turn it on and fly, no spinning around before flight.  Range is well over 1.5 miles compared to 1/4 mile at most for the F11.<br /><br />As a new drone buyer, I was sucked into the allure of 4K video, and all of the features, but now I have learned that a crappy camera that shoots 4K is worse than a high quality one in 2.7 with a gimble.<br /><br />And now I don’t have to worry about losing important footage that cannot be replaced.<br /><br />Spend the extra $100 (or $200 for the Fly More combo pack with 3 batteries), and go from a disposable drone with low quality everything to something that is engineered to last years, and will take professional cinematic quality videos.<br /><br />I commend Ruko for trying, and I appreciate that they have copied everything from the carrying case to remote functionality - from DJI, as this helped me to fly the DJI out of the box, but this drone misses the mark in quality and reliability.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />This is my first drone, which I bought to work on a video project for a group I'm in.  Video and photo quality is very good, and photos are indeed 4K!<br /><br />Flying is easy, and all functions work very well.  Setup order is important:  Power Drone; Power remote; pair remote; turn on app; calibrate gyroscope; connect to GPS, etc.<br /><br />Range is decent.  Turn phone to airplane mode and this gives the best range.  Trees and buildings limit range significantly.  The range of the remote is much further than the WiFi range, so your phone camera feed will freeze up hundreds of feet before the remote will no longer control the drone.  Return to home is a great feature, and when I have lost sight of, and my bearings to where the drone is, this brought it back to within about 2 feet of where it took off every time.<br /><br />Battery life is very good, at over 20 minutes.<br /><br />Overall, a great drone, and a lot of fun to fly!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kVbYn7OJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kVbYn7OJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kVbYn7OJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGEEKFDK37FL22UIE365RIQLMEJQ,1578369094242,9,True

710,3.0,"Great potential, but nowhere near advertised performance","There are many things I like about this drone.  It does seem to be of good quality, and the basic controls and short-range responsiveness seem very good.  The control app is also vgood, and I especially like the map display with waypoint and drone orientation features.<br />While I understand that it is a lower priced drone, the main thing I was willing to give up (versus one of the drones that are 2x or 3x the F11's price) is the lack of gimbal and image stabilization.  It is a little shaky and image tilts with the drone body when maneuvering, as expected, so no real complaint there.<br />However, even at a lower price, I was still expecting something close to the range performance that it advertises. Even in fairly ideal conditions, it way under-performed on its advertised specs.  Especially the live video transmission: with the drone at about 150ft/0.5m of altitude, video feed got glitchy around 150m and froze up completely in less than 200m. Far short of the advertised live video range of 500m.  With live video frozen, I was able to re-orient and fly the drone back using the map display, or the Return To Home option.  But if the live video transmission range falls so short, it is hard to trust the other controls and commands beyond that range.  So it could be a great drone if they could improve the actual range performance, or for someone that is sure they will always want to  operate with such short range needs.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AF2ZHLGP73SHABZM3SZEF7M5GA4A,1599850859669,0,False

713,5.0,Easy to Fly,"[[VIDEOID:8dbb9457b07c4e27ca8de8420e2768c7]] New to the sport.  Started with a cheaper, lighter quad copter and was getting discouraged having to constantly fight with controlling one that seemed to have a mind of it's own.  The Ruko (SJRC) F11 Pro is very easy and forgiving to fly, which makes it fun instead of frustrating.  When you release the joy sticks, it stops and hovers until you make the next move, which is great for us beginners.  The drone is solid and appears very well made.  I had no trouble connecting to the app with both a Galaxy S7 and a Galaxy S9 Android phone.  I have not used a micro sd card as yet.

717,5.0,Great bang for the buck!,[[VIDEOID:343b82a3b87c2c0cfd8e1ed1d8a2d9c7]] This is a great drone the won't break the bank for beginners and experienced  fliers. This is my second drone I have owned.  A couple years ago I purchased a little toy drone to learn the basics and recently decided to step up my game and boy am I glad I did. This is easy to set up and fly. Comes with good paper and video instructions. Camera works great and is easy to learn. Unfortunately it's been a bit windy while learning to fly this drone and look forward to sunny and calm skies. It seems to do very well in the lower winds and being that it weighs a bit over 1lb helps. I am very impressed with this so far and would recommend it.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vr+2Q1CPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vr+2Q1CPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vr+2Q1CPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHEV24V7KJMYZKCOR7FFDBN7TEBQ,1593713221377,0,True
718,4.0,"Awesome Drone, Excellent Customer Service","I've only had mine for a few days but so far this thing performs great. I've had no problems with the video to my phone although I haven't gone a great distance yet. It was very easy to set up and as far as ease of control this thing is unbelievable. It's not fast, at least in beginner mode. I haven't taken it out of beginner mode yet. If you're going full speed forward or side to side and you let go of the sticks, the drone comes to a hover. The flight times are as advertised. I got 30 minutes out of both batteries on my first flight and I don't think they were even fully charged. My next few flights we're just as good on time. So far the video seems as good as they claim and I haven't used the memory slot video. It's supposed to be a lot better. I haven't noticed a lot of shaking going on in the video. The servo that moves my camera is always buzzing which, in my experience, means it's under some sort of stress. I'll update after I've used the ""follow me"" and ""waypoints"" part of the app but so far I am very pleased and the drone itself is powerful and can handle the wind.<br />UPDATE: I was having an issue with my camera so they were going to send me a new one. They sent me a video on how to switch out the camera but when I was removing the camera, 2 micro wifi board connectors popped off the wires. I talk customer support and ask them to send me a couple of new connectors but they didn't have any so they replace my drone with a new one. This is the best customer service I have ever dealt with. They respond to your emails quickly and are ready to help in any way they can. I love this company and I love this drone. Highly recommend for beginners and mid-range drone pilots. If you're looking to do some aerial photography then I would also recommend this drone. It may not have a gimbal but you can line up your shots intake great photographs. Especially the ones on the memory card. This is a great deal and I always get it while you can.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEA7CDXAGBWGVDO7GGYLIBDHIKSA,1614730662638,0,True
719,5.0,Great Customer Service,"I will divide this review into several different parts. Part One: Flight. The F11 flies well enough for the price. It’s responsive. It tends to over react when you end a maneuver. This does not bode well if you are taking a video.  Part Two: Remote. This remote is very basic. The remote on the HS 720 is a much better remote providing a lot more information. Part Three: Smartphone Display. The WiFi signal between the F11 and my iPhone is weak at best. I only get video displayed out to about 300 yards. After that the WiFi signal drops out and the on screen video freezes. Very disappointing. Part Five: Camera. The camera is ok. I don’t like the built in down angle on the lens so you don’t see the blades. It can make judging the height of obstacles in front of you hard to judge. It also has a hard time adapting to light changes. A him left mount would be helpful. Overall I give it about 3.8 out of five stars. Give it a stronger WiFi signal, software upgrade and fix the camera and it would be a solid 5 star.<br />New update on this drone. Nearing the end of my flight yesterday, I enabled the RTH feature on my drone. After what seemed like a really long period of time, my drone finally appeared overhead. The drone never stabilized to a hover, but instead was flying erratically. I tried to regain control but could not. The drone would take off in one direction and then change course to another. I could control the altitude and the direction, but as soon as I tried to hover it, off it would go. I had good GPS signal the whole time. Finally crashed into the woods bout 100 meters from me after the battery died. Only plus note was the tracking feature on the app enabled me to find my drone in the woods. Result, right front arm broken and several props damaged. I do not recommend this drone anymore and would not by it again.<br />Well the saga continues. Contacted Ruko again. They sent me a refurbished drone. Have been flying that one with great success. Even though I have had some problems with their drones, they do provide great customer service and they make it right. I am aware that this happens to just about every manufacturer that I have looked into. I think drone manufactures are trying to develop their drones features to quickly and maybe not testing the environments they fly in. But customer service is the key and Ruko comes thru in spades.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AF2TBJ6GWAYSBEZ2YZWSYINS57EQ,1582681195890,65,True
720,2.0,Drone malfunctioned and went off into a tree with less than 3 months use.,"[[VIDEOID:477ea69d12c189d41ac474481148f237]] I would have given this drone a great review because it was good while we had it, but on my husband's last flight in November 15th the drone malfunctioned and would not allow him to gain control while it was suspended in the air. The drone lost its control and went off into a tree and we were unable to recover it. I contacted the seller on this issue and I am having a difficult time trying to get any resolution on this issue. The product was still within 3 months of receiving it. We followed the instructions to send over flight data but the app is not working as the instruction specified. We sent the last video recording which clearly shows it was malfunctioning and a screen recording of how the app is not responding. I would be lying if I said I wasn't frustrated because to spend this kind of money for something to last less than 3 months just feels like a waste of money and upsetting to be honest. I am hoping to receive some positive responses from the seller.<br /><br />I will update my review once I am able to have this issue cleared.

Drone was very responsive<br />3. The F11- Drone was easy to calibrate, fly, and store<br />4. Battery life- I got 22-24 minutes out of the 30 minute rated battery. I think I can get more but I didn’t want to push it.<br />5. Camera- The camera took great videos of my neighborhood and the footage was very smooth, not jerky. It literally made me look like a seasoned flyer instead of a first time one<br />6. Aesthetics- The look is badass, no need to say more<br />7. App features- The app is packed with features. I didn’t test them all but was satisfied with the waypoint feature, one touch takeoff and land, and follow me mode.<br /><br />Cons- For me, I don’t have any, I absolutely love this drone and am looking forward to many hours of fun!

We are glad we waited about a year before buying our first drone. This was mainly due to short flying times unless you sent close to $1000 or more.

748,1.0,"Drone flies well, can't aim camera. Won't get again.","Update: It seems like a firmware issue. The camera will run the entire 90 degrees quickly and without issue during the boot up process. After that, it moves to the center(45 degrees) and stops. The remote can only move it about 10 degrees up and down.  Which makes it useless as a camera platform.<br /><br />The drone flies well, if you don't need the camera. It only aims in one direction,  and you cannot adjust its angle in flight.  There is a control on the remote,  but it doesn't actually do anything.  Documentation says to turn it off, move the camera, and turn it on again. No help.<br /><br />Out of the 5 initial flights,  the app has disconnected twice.  It's UI is ok, not my favorite out of the drones I've flown. Probably will stay away from this brand in the future.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFE74KMH7Y7O3YY325C2KUBO6WTQ,1585252553919,6,True

They said format as FAT, which does not exist for mac. Then, the drone recorded in an unreadable mp4 format. I use mp4 every day and have never seen this.

750,5.0,Awesome beginner drone,"[[VIDEOID:103e88937be651ed3da9846d1f4b440]] So, this is my first big expense drone. I am very happy, for the price, this drone far exceeded any expectations. Ruko has hit one out of the park with this one. It is very easy to learn how to use right out of the box, had no trouble doing it by following the included instructions. The drone has a lot of very neat features you would only find on more expensive drones, and the camera image quality is amazing. In the US it does have to be registered because of its weight and size, and on that, it is a very sturdy and tough feeling drone. You will not be disappointed with this investment. For beginner, amature, or even expert, you will enjoy it.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/10/20: So, just wanted to add, the companies customer service and follow up has been amazing. They emailed me twice with follow up, and some nice suggestions for flying, and helped me very quickly resolve a small issue. I have had the drone for about two and a half weeks now, flying everyday to learn all its tricks and handling. If I could give this more than 5 stars I would, and Ruko goes above and beyond on customer service.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+lph9WibL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+lph9WibL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+lph9WibL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHMZC33WZ47HLRQHFWYT6PIRV3GQ,1591243425223,38,True

761,5.0,Great starter drone,"I recently became interested in the drone piloting hobby. I did my research, quite extensively if you ask, to find the beat drone at the $300 price point I was looking for. The Ruko F11 Pro beat out the Holy Stone HS720 due to the reviews on the F11 Pro’s camera. When it arrived one battery was already charged so I just needed to charge the remote and the other batter. I took it out for its maiden flight the following day. Setup and preflight were as instructed and straightforward. Once I was in the air I amazed at how nibble the F11 Pro was and how easy it was to control. I took mostly video and then screenshot some pictures in post. I will try to link them in the review without any editing. I was very pleased at the picture quality and video quality. I would highly recommend the F11 Pro to anyone that is looking for a first drone to start an exciting hobby.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715nPKTQisL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715nPKTQisL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715nPKTQisL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SHN1wsP-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SHN1wsP-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SHN1wsP-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHOKJNCJ6G5UCWQMG74DMHOMWM7Q,1594288814085,0,True

765,5.0,Terrific Quality  and Affordable Drone,"I picked up this drone because of the price and the high amount of positive feedback.  It's clear it was a good choice.  First thing you notice is the nice case.  Everything fits very nicely into it's cut foam area to keep it very snug and safe during transporting.  Then you notice the solid build of the drone and the weight. Not overly heavy but you know you can fly it outside and not worry about a breeze blowing it away.  Because of the weight it will need to be registered with the FAA but that was only 5 minutes and $5 for a three years.  Next you notice how easy it is to change the battery.  This is great as I've had some drones you nearly had to do surgery on to get to the charge port on the battery.  Then there is the flight.  I've only had it out for it's maiden flight but talk about impressed.  I hooked the remote up to my  Samsung Galaxy Note 9.  The instructions to get the drone up and flying were very easy to follow.  Then it was up.  The drone starts in ""beginner"" mode so won't go as high or as far.  This is good so you can get used to it but can easily change it and set your own height and distance limits.  Very smooth controls and response from the drone.  No jerkiness.  Took it up, flew it around.  Pivoted the camera remotely. (great feature)  then took it as high and far as I could in the beginner mode and hit the auto return/land.  It put it right down less than a foot from where it took off.  GPS worked great on it.  This being my first flight and spending extra time getting used to the features of the App and remote, I spent all of 20-25 minutes on this flight on the one battery.<br />Overall I'm very impressed with this drone and very I chose this one over all the other drone choices.<br />For the money, I don't feel you could find a better drone.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHESWXLTLCYNZIYRNG5CTF2JQIFA,1610809556002,0,True
766,4.0,Great product for first time user.  Instructions could be improved.,"I love my purchase but I had to spend a lot of time watching third party youtube videos and ultimately sitting down and making my own cheat sheet to use while I was learning the system.  I would love to see a laminated quick guide with launching steps on one side and flying/control diagram on the other.<br /><br />The unit itself is well made and feature rich.  I recommend keeping things simple to start:<br /><br />1. Go thru launch sequence a few time perhaps just launching and landing.  Make sure wide open field and lite to no wind.<br />2. Move on to make sure all the functions are calibrated and working such as GPS, gimble, etc.  the drone should be able to hover with not intervention from controls.<br />3. Next try the manual flying with something simple. Don’t panic most corrections can be made by releasing the controller and allowing drone to return to hover.<br />4. Test and fully learn the return to home function<br />5. Test and fully learn the emergency landing function<br />6. Try the automated flight function (creating a flight way points)<br />7. Play around with video and picture taking<br />8. Play around with follow me function<br /><br />Now you have the basics.  And for the advanced you can go after facial/person recognition follow function or hand gesture functions.  I have yet to cross that line.<br /><br />VERY COOL PURCHASE AND TRULY RECOMMEND.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFXY6RPM3W3T6YVB5T4LHGV4YTLA,1680580557014,1,True

780,5.0,GREAT Drone Value,"This is my 1st drone. I'm 71 yrs old, retired and have been flying RC planes for many decades, but never a copter.<br /><br />PROS - The F11 Pro is VERY stout, simple to use, has terrific flight times, is super steady in the hover and really could NOT be easier to safely fly while having great fun. The camera provides a great picture and the operational range and the speed of this drone once out of ""Beginner"" flight parameters is simply amazing. But in Beginner mode I am certain anyone can fly it and learn to fly it well. It comes with two flight batteries which many drone packages do not offer. The carry case is good looking, fits the components perfectly and provides very good protection. I feel the F11 Pro is a good starter drone and still maintains being an ""adult"" drone with NO toy-like sie or features.<br /><br />CONS - The transmitter's fake antennas serve no purpose at all and are rather silly IMHO - the real antenna is inside the transmitter on a circuit board. The smart phone holder is rather 'flimsy' and the top & bottom ""lips"" of the holder cannot grasp my Moto G6 Play very well if I leave it in its protective case. If the edges were only slightly deeper and the spring slider more robust it would be a a true treat.<br /><br />Other than those two admittedly 'picky' negatives, I think this unit represents a solid value at a reasonably price.

Getting started takes a bit, but once you get that down this drone just let's you fly and not fight it the whole time.<br /><br />One feature that is great, especially for beginners is the return button. If you get out and can't clearly see how to get back to where you can land you hit that and it comes flying back.<br /><br />The 2 batteries give you a good amount of fly time.<br /><br />I have attached some camera examples of this drone. Let's you observe things from a different perspective.<br /><br />I feel this is very much worth the price. Lots to enjoy here and no steep curve or struggles to get going.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uIxNYo2zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uIxNYo2zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uIxNYo2zL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEA4CBG25RVOMAMP435JPOPSOSLA,1659400179114,0,True

I've already replaced one arm and a couple of blades. It's not easy, but you can buy the parts, rather than replacing the entire drone.<br /><br />It takes practice to get used to it. I still have a long way to go, but am slowly getting better. The camera is good enough for basic work. Take the time to learn all the controls. Realize you can go in a slower mode to start with, which is useful because most crashes happen when going too fast and I react in the wrong direction. I'd recommend this for someone wanting to start out.<br /><br />Addendum: when using the ""follow me"" option you can't move faster than 5 mph or else the drone rocks while trying to follow you.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFX7AYS3OYGOO7IVUCZHMWSFAJKQ,1616448950392,0,True

798,5.0,Simple and Easy to Use,"Decided to pick this up for an upcoming trip I have to some national parks.

If you are in an open and clear space outside, and follow the instructions (which you are in three different places, so you always have a way to look at the instructions) you can literally start flying this thing in a few minutes. The speed level of the drone is a bit high at first, but you can turn that down on the fly. Makes controlling way way way easier when you do so.<br /><br />Very important to read the instructions first and the manual so you get a grasp of the different functions and procedures beforehand, but after that, it is extremely easy to fly outdoors.<br /><br />Would recommend to any novice that wants to get into drones.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFL6LEODTWDQO3QLDRNPF62OJLDQ,1598619266588,0,True

Yes, it comes with two batteries with the option for a possible third if you ""write honest product review"" on Amazon. The batteries last about 25-30 minutes as advertised.<br />When I first started (without fully reading the directions) I crashed it into the furniture three times and it seems no worse for the ware. It has solid high-grade plastic construction. Motors are relatively quiet.<br />This thing essentially has an inertial navigation system paired with GPS. Did I mention that it is Amazing?<br />In a 5-8 mph wind it does fine. On a moderately windy day I moved it up to about 200 feet where there was a stronger wind and I had to bring it back down to maintain control.<br />I don't know what the other recent generation drones are like, but this one is well worth a few hundred dollars.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AECCHVGLOW2FJ5LBQRFRA5GNYLTA,1576876318205,6,True

The developers could have kept all stages in connection different colors but it’s primarily blue and white all the way into the setup process. Took me 30 mins to get my head around how to setup before ready to fly. After that, we flew it it was exciting and the drone felt amazing flying with the controller it could go far up and stay in the air with winds. The description said its 4K camera however it’s only a 1080p so that was misleading. After that, we charged the battery for the whole day and it wouldn’t charge, eventually had to use the replacement battery included. Didn’t fly the second time, the app could not find a GPS signal, and after 1 hour of attempting to get it all set up, did not work.

826,5.0,"Great drone, Worth it for the price. Great for beginners and Intermediate/advanced","I don’t normally write reviews but I was surprised by the drone quality for the price that it is. This is my first real drone I’ve purchased. (I have other RC type drones that are much cheaper in function and price) I did do a good amount of research on drones before purchasing. I believe this is a great drone for beginners and for the intermediate/advanced. Especially for the price.<br /><br />In depth Review below...<br /><br />Follow the directions. Read/skim through the short manual it comes with. The later pages are the most important on the functions and operating, charging etc. Theres also good videos on YouTube you can watch as well since the manual and video they provide is not the clearest of explanations. The drone is in beginner mode by default so it won’t go that far or high until you override the settings but it’s great for a beginner like myself to get used to. For my first few times using it I made sure to use it in a wide open space but it’s easy to get the hang of and feel comfortable with controlling it. After 2-3 uses i was comfortable enough to increase the flight height and distance in the settings in the app. You can also change the speed setting from the controller and the angle of the camera which is great.<br /><br />I don’t really have any negatives to say except that I think it’s crazy it takes 5 hours to charge the battery for 20-30 minutes of flight time (depending on conditions/flight speed/movement) But thats not specific to this drone it’s just normal average flight time with drone batteries. Also this comes with 2 batteries so it makes up for the short flight time.<br /><br />I’ve flown the drone 5-6 times now and once at night. I’ve used the Take-Off/Landing button/function which works well. The Return Home one is great as well especially if the drone gets out of your sight and you lose your sense of direction in regards to the location of the drone and the take off point. Just be aware that when in Return Home mode the drone does not avoid obstacles such as trees. But I did see a Return Altitude setting with the Height and Distance settings so I think as long as you set this high enough (above the trees) you can have the drone “Return Home” to above you then safely land it manually. I haven’t played with the rest of the functions like Follow-Me mode, Point of Interest, Way Point Flight or the Hand Gesture function. I just don’t have any use for those functions at the moment or the right environment to test them but I will update here once I test out the rest of the functions/modes. But that being said there’s a bunch of functionality. I think the drone is worth it even with out having tested all the other functions yet. Its easy to use and control. The camera quality is pretty darn good. I would recommend this drone for anyone whose looking for a quality drone for a good price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61k47mITDML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61k47mITDML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61k47mITDML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dt-U1nBZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dt-U1nBZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dt-U1nBZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qG3jzum+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qG3jzum+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qG3jzum+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rJUDg84GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rJUDg84GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rJUDg84GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-pJuyljtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-pJuyljtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-pJuyljtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGVGFZOLYIYI3YO3SZYB65APMRNA,1603066767482,1,True

It's a huge step up from the little $60 micro indoor drone I'd been using previously.<br /><br />The GPS stabilization is great with light wind, and makes learning feel safer. You can just let go of the controls and know that it'll stay in place, or press return to home if it gets out of sight and you panic. The video transmission is clear, and I felt comfortable flying solely by looking at the camera stream in quick time. The follow-me, orbit, and point-of-interest guided flight functions all work well.<br /><br />It's also durable. I crashed it once while flying indoors, and it fell from about 9-10 ft with no major side-effects - just a few scuffs on two of the blades.<br /><br />The instructions and the video that they offer to teach you how to use drone are good, but there are also many helpful videos on youtube to get the hang of any functions you're struggling with.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend the drone to anyone considering it!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGH7MJF75QQEI5OOK7NB6QGZG6WA,1582479589745,0,True

It also included a second set of blades.  The Amazon ad indicated if I ordered it now, I would get $100 off which DID NOT happen.  The drone company, however, offered me a third battery, additional blades and extended the warranty to compensate.  Also, the distance it can fly was greater than most other drones I looked at.  I wish it had an Obstacle Avoidance feature and the directions were a little more detailed. However, since I am just a beginner and learning, I was able to fly this drone right out of the box without much difficulty.  The remote battery lasts much longer than the drone batteries so it doesn't need to be charged as often.  In wind, this drone does drift a bit when flying but holds its on while hovering.

We have only gone out twice  with it for half hour each time., but already tested most of the features.  It returns to where it launched from, within about 3 meters. It self adjusts when blown by the wind. The video and still camera are easy to use, though aiming the lens is pretty tricky (especially in the wind).  We were not able to get the hand signals to work yet, but that may be due to the wind not allowing a steady image. We have also not tested way points yet.

844,5.0,Perfect drone for all skill levels.,"For my first drone, this is exactly what I need. I’ve been wanting a drone for so long and after waiting and reading and watching reviews I took the plunge. No regrets at all so far. With two batteries that hold for the length of time they’re rated at, 30 mins. each, I have plenty of time to practice flying skills. If you are as new to drone flying as I am (even with video gaming experience reaching way back) it does have its learning curve. I make sure I’m away from everything  and just fly - the only way to practice.  It did come with spare propellers but I also bought a separate set that Amazon recommended. It also comes with two rather short cables for charging either the remote and/or the batteries. Charging time does take a bit so keep that in mind. I had seen somewhere an actual device made to charge two of these at once, but really I just use my own longer cable and 5v adapter and it works just fine like that. It also has a beginner mode that is active by default on the app which is definitely a good idea as this thing can escape from view real fast and unless you are already used to looking at the FPV the drone gives you could do some chasing. Once you want to take the leap though, disabling beginner mode is just a click and then you can set your own limits to the distance, height, and return height for the drone. The max is 2000 m and to be honest as a biginner that is more than far enough. Going any further sounds fun in theory but I’m more than happy with this as I progress to better flying skills. The case is pretty good quality and the instructions in English are very easy to follow and complete. It also comes with a quick start thicker insert that you can use for reference quickly instead of thumbing through the manual.<br />Again, I say this is a home run for sure and I could not be more satisfied at all.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFRIONWP3KCRPRVN2HBMLOZKMB2A,1578446067195,3,True

846,5.0,"Impressive - A+ bang for the buck, maybe best value in drones","Wow. About five flights in and extremely impressed with the engineering, design, but above all the quality. Prior experience was about two weeks with a $100 drone but this device is about 5,000% better and more able than that one.<br /><br />I don't think you can beat the fun factor + features of this device at this price point. You can pay more but I don't think that you get more in the exchange. So if you want a starter or entry-level quad device - this is IT.<br /><br />Lots of great features. In order of importance:<br /><br />(1) Flight time is incredible - nearly an hour in the box (among 2x batteries)<br />(2) Compared to other drones at this price point this guy is STURDY (high quality)<br />(3) FUN to fly<br />(4) Tons of additional features from GPS flight / recovery / 5 gHz connection<br />(5) USB (micro) rechargeable batteries + controller (I have a ton of these cables lying around)<br />(6) Folds into a protective foam carrying case the size of a car battery for easy portability<br /><br />I see a lot of value in the GPS but I actually found it to be not what I was looking for - for backyard flying (close to the house / obstacles) I prefer the ""attitude"" mode which just means manual / user is in full control.<br /><br />Out of a 100, I give this baby a 98 - especially, again, at this price point - you're not going to do any better.<br /><br />I just have two things to mention that could use some improvement - both possible with updated firmware:<br /><br />(1) Device tends to lose altitude during turns - it is very minor, but if the device pivots / yaws especially in a mid- to high-speed turn, it tends to drop altitude slightly during the maneuever. This is not something that cannot be corrected - I've found myself just giving it a little ""boost"" with the left joystick while turning - but during turns in tighter space it can be jarring. I think it is because the device is redirecting power to the turn and in doing so it doesn't have as much available, at the inflection point, to keep the device level - it is easily corrected for but I thought that I'd mention it<br /><br />(2) I'm still getting used to landing - in fact my entire last flight was dedicated to practicing landing. So what happens is if there's any movement due to right joystick corrections meant to keep the device steady in 2D (wind primarily) at all the device tends to not want to land properly, in that it somehow senses the imminent proximity of the ground / surface and ""jumps"" up while you're trying to get the skids to touch down - I have been tinkering with the one-touch button landing feature and to be honest I have not yet mastered it - compared to other drones it feels finicky when trying to touch down. The workaround could be just using the cut-off which requires about a three-second hold while hovering VERY near the ground but I did this at too high altitude at one point and it dropped a little too suddenly for my taste, so I'm back to the drawing board more or less.

887,4.0,Excellent Customer Service for a Great Drone,"[[VIDEOID:411c59426510e50336dd4dd5e9f17b1d]] I bought this drone initially for the hd video, but there was a significant problem with the initial drone's video quality.  Between Amazon and the company's excellent product support, however, I received a replacement drone in no time.  This customer service for me is a big deal.  The drone video quality is now excellent.  I seem a little slow to master this contraption, so it's highly likely this is a 5-star device being operated by a 3-star user.  That said, I'll share some of my challenges.<br /><br />It says it can be operated inside, so I thought this might be a good way to get familiar with the drone's basic operation.  I'd follow the instructions for inside takeoff, and just like that it would it careen into something.  It doesn't seem to want to just go three feet up and hold still.  It prefers to go three feet up and careen wildly to the right or left.  After multiple crashes and terrifying the cat, I decided to move outside.<br /><br />Usually, the outside operation works pretty well.  The video I attached, however, shows one instance where my transmitter suddenly lost connection with the drone at precisely the same time it was running it out of power at relatively high altitude.  (My iPhone conveniently decided to change wifi from Ruko to my home's wifi network instead.)  I retained the ""death spiral"" down as I was trying to regain control of the thing and (a) keep from crashing and (b) keep from crashing in neighbor's yards.<br /><br />The remote is not particularly intuitive to use, but I think it just requires practice.  The drone's camera is quite good, as mentioned previously, but the final video needs to be edited due to the choppiness that takes place when you change direction or encounter winds.  It seems remarkably durable, which is very important for a drone too.<br /><br />I do recommend this drone for new flyers, but I also recommend getting the extended warranty and being sure you read everything carefully.  It's a great product, but it's NOT a toy!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AH4ENHFYKGXYWZATODKRQFFX6VPA,1659234125124,0,False

892,5.0,"Built to last, this amazing quad-copter will surprise you! I promise!","I was extremely happy to receive the quad-copter a day early! Overall, after looking at the many choices on Amazon, the Ruko F11 Pro caught my attention and it DEFINITELY delivers! It's perfectly rugged and sturdy and nicely steady even in a moderate wind. It's easy to learn the controls and everything go straight to your phone (also an option to have a microSD card but it's not required!). The best part is that the height of the camera is adjustable, so you can take amazing landscape shots! I purchased this to a chance on a decent drone that I could learn to fly with, and the F11 Pro has over-exceeded my expectations! Evidently the controller can be used with other RC drones as well, if properly synced. In regards to the controller, the build quality is also very good. The handles are firm and not easy to pull out when I unfold it, but the controls and buttons feel absolutely solid.<br />The case is also a big plus, has a really nice finish and I love how all the pieces fit securely ( as I mainly want to take this on trips and get some cool footage ).<br /><br />This is the first drone I've ever flown, and I was able to do it fairly effortlessly.<br /><br />Overall I'm beyond happy with my purchase and if you're looking for a drone to start out with that has a ton of incredible features, GET THIS DRONE! 110% worth the investment!",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHFEXEW7VXZ3P2ID6UJXH5D3YMNA,1588090685343,0,True

906,5.0,A definite win!!!,"*****5 STARS*****<br />I bought my Ruko drone at the beginning of March. I have had a dozen or so drones and helicopters in the last 12-15 years so I do have quite a bit of flight experience. The Ruko drone is a dream compared to all of them!<br /> I have flown it 3-4 times per week and I still get 30mins of flight time out of each battery. I love this drone. It is super simple to fly! It hovers when you let go of the controls right where it is. It automatically adjusts and keeps itself in the same spot when you let go of the controls.<br /> PROS:<br /> Flight-<br /><br /> Flight time is awesome! 30mins per battery. Stable and easy to fly. I let my daughter who has never flown anything RC and she did it effortlessly.<br /> The distance is adjustable.<br /> Can be flown first person or line of sight.<br /> The speed can be adjusted to three different levels. So if it’s a tight area you can slow down the movements to help avoid crashing into objects.<br /> It also has a self landing feature that is awesome! Push the button and it will start landing right then. It won’t just drop either. It slows itself down and lands smooth and gently.<br /> It also has a return to home feature that is cool. Hit the button and it comes back and lands from the spot it took off.<br /> In my opinion the greatest thing about this drone is how stable it flys in the wind. Every single drone I have had up until this one, I could not fly if there was any wind. Not this one! I’ve flown it in some pretty nasty wind(20+mph) with ease!<br /><br />Camera-<br /> The camera takes great video and pictures. I’m not a camera pro so I can’t really get too detailed about the quality. So far it does everything I need it to do.<br /><br />Battery-<br /> The life of the battery seems to be holding great! I fly my Ruko quite a bit(3-4 times per week for an hour) and have not seen any drop in flight time. The battery’s are easy to install and remove. Pinch the buttons on the sides and it pops out. Push it back in until it clicks. Simple. Charge time isn’t bad at all. I haven’t timed it or anything however, I’ve had drones in the past that take half the day or more to charge one battery. This one is a couple hours.<br /><br />Durability-<br /> So I am very impressed with how tough this drone is. I have crashed it into my tree(or two) and into my clothes line and have yet to change a blade or repair anything else. It still flys perfect! Not even a cracked or broken blade.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br /> Flight-<br /> Be careful when using the return to home feature...if you fly it to where there is a tree or house or any other object between the drone and the spot it took off from, it doesn’t know that and will crash into them trying to get back to where it left from.<br /> The only other thing that I would like to see improved is the lag between the camera and phone when I am flying. It is pretty good til you get a couple hundred feet away then it starts lagging and the first person view is worthless.<br /> The only other thing I would change is the camera recording sound. You have to manually turn it on each time or you get a silent video. In order to turn it on you have to be paired with your phone. That part sucks.<br /> These are the only cons I have found with this drone.<br /><br /> So to sum it up, this drone is awesome! I definitely recommend it! I have recommended it to friends already.<br /> A buddy of mine is a drone freak! He custom builds his own. He was impressed with my Ruko. He really liked the flight time.<br /> If you want a fun and easy drone to fly, this is a great place to start no matter what level of experience you have flying drones.<br /><br />Ree B",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGWMIYRLDFEF7DGMZ4GC4X2BN7CQ,1589746933855,8,True
907,4.0,"Good First Impressions, Not Hard For A Beginner, Need More Use For A Deeper Review","I recently became interested in buying a drone as a complement to photo/video work I enjoy doing when I go out to different places. I was looking for something at a reasonable price with some decent features, and the Ruko F11 came to my attention as a generally low-cost intro-level drone with some options that go beyond the very basics. A little more digging found the F11 Pro, which comes with a second battery and a few more features for a very similar price to the base version along with buying an extra battery separately, so I went with the Pro and bought a micro-SD card to use in the unit for recording video/photo.<br /><br />Out of the box, the drone is essentially ready to fly once you do a bit of initial setup. You can install an app that allows you to see through your phone what the drone sees, and the remote has a convenient clip that will hold the phone in place. I took the case off my Galaxy S10+ because it fit a little better without it.<br /><br />It is very important to go through the full setup process for calibration. If you skip any steps or don't let them complete, you will run the risk of the drone trying to fly off on you as soon as you direct it into the air, and fighting with the controls can be a difficult experience especially for a novice. I had this happen to me twice and the second time, it came close to veering into the side of a hill before I got it close enough to cut the motors for a semi-rough landing, but the drone itself was undamaged and it was a lesson learned. Do not just assume everything is good to go just because you calibrated it in a different place half an hour ago.<br /><br />That said, setup is relatively easy and the instructions walk you through it step by step, whether with the booklet, a separate card that comes with the drone, or through the phone app. When you've set it up properly and connected to the drone's own wifi, you will be able to see remaining battery power in the drone and the remote, through the app. If you're flying the drone close to you and there are some obstacles such as tree limbs or power lines nearby, you might find it easier to steer it while watching it yourself, but once you're used to flying it further and higher away (and if you turn off Beginner limits in the app), this is where viewing it through the app comes in very handy. This will help with positioning, direction, and so on, and adjusting the camera's angle can be done through the remote as well.<br /><br />Be aware that there are limitations to the distance in which the wifi signal comes clearly back to the phone, so you can fly beyond that and get a choppy visual image. The range of the remote itself extends beyond this, but as a novice drone pilot this was something I found I had to be aware of. It is also important to keep an eye on your battery's charge. Each one lasts nearly half an hour from a full charge, and when it gets low the lights on the drone will start to turn red and it will try to return to its launch point. If there are obstacles in the way, it is not high-end enough to have a feature such as collision detection, so pay attention to that.<br /><br />As for flying it, I found it to be easy to control and very responsive to my input. As a first-timer, I went to an open park and just got used to how it flies, and of course I had moments where I jerked it too far one way or another, but it held its position very steadily when I brought it close to a fence by a baseball field, elevated it above it, flew over it, then lowered it and repeated the other way. On my second try, I flew it close by some trees and power lines, and it was responsive with a little bit of adjusting needed to account for a mild breeze. I'm not sure yet how much wind I'd risk sending it up in, though.<br /><br />The primary reason I got it, and the third time I flew it, was to take it down to Shasta Lake in California to view some places left behind when Shasta Dam was built, such as old roads, bridges, and rail locations that are normally underwater except during drought conditions. The drone performed very well here, and I recorded about 35 minutes worth of video that I split between the two batteries I had. This is where I had a near-miss when I didn't go through the proper calibration steps all the way, but that is a lesson learned. You can see some still images I took from videos I captured.<br /><br />The drone flew steadily and I while I think I would prefer a non-fisheye lens to the one the F11 Pro comes with, along with a gimbal, which the F11 Pro also does not have, I found the video quality to be adequate for what I paid for. If I want better features, I would need to spend a bit more and Ruko offers a newer version of this drone that has a gimbal with a non-fisheye lens, but based on some reviews I've seen the jury may be out as to which one actually flies better.<br /><br />Anyway, I've found so far that keeping the lens facing straight ahead gives me better color quality to what I'm seeing, and based on the angle of the drone as it's flying I can still see the majority of what I want to. You do get a little bit of the propellers in the shot, but that's not too bad. The fisheye distortion shows a bit more as you're turning or straightening things out. If you don't like the fisheye effect and want more image stabilization, consider a different model, whether one by Ruko or another manufacturer.<br /><br />Batteries take a few hours to charge, and there are specs listed as to what kind of power adapter you should use. Basically, a phone charger will do fine and you want to make sure it's about 1-3A. This model comes with a nice little carrying case that can house the drone, one battery, the remote, and the documentation that comes with it. It is recommended to keep the battery disconnected from the drone when you are not using it.<br /><br />The drone software comes with additional features I have not yet had the chance to explore, such as a 'follow you' function, the ability to circle an object for a 360 view of it, and a point-to-point ability you can 'draw' on a map of the place you're in. These are not important features for me, but they are there for those who want to make use of them. The app will also provide you with a flight record and keep what you recorded, but you can use the micro-SD card to transfer higher-quality videos to your computer later.<br /><br />I think as a first-time user of a drone, this was a good entry point for me. I've found actually flying it to be easy to pick up as a beginner, and with more experience I will get more steady with it. Do be sure to download an app like 'B4UFLY' to check for any restrictions in the area you live in or go to. I live close enough to a small airport that there are height limitations to be aware of, for example.

932,5.0,Highly Recommended Beginner Quadcopter Drone,"This was my first Quadcopter experience.  The value is outstanding with excellent features including 5G dual-band wifi, GPS, 4K video and photos.  I originally ordered the F-11, then noted there are two versions, the F11 and F11 PRO.  F11 PRO includes enhanced GPS and 4K video, while the F11 has standard GPS and 4K photos, 1080P video.  It took a bit of research to notice the two version and identify the differences.  F11 Pro camera lens is slightly different with no outside ring and the bottom of the camera module is flat where the lower resolution camera module has a dip toward the front.  Replacement camera modules are available online through other sellers for both versions, however Q/A state that the PRO 4K video camera module is not a compatible swap for the F11 1080P camera module.  I did not order to try to upgrade the camera module, rather I returned the purchase through Amazon and upgraded to the F11 PRO which is about $20 more.  The purchase was refunded as soon as the F11 model was dropped off at the shipper with no issues.

The carrying case comes with everything you need to operate it with just your smart phone. Set up is quick and easy and there are step by step instructions before each flight that are accessible.

It's definitely not a $50 drone.  It comes with a nice sleek case for easy carrying.  My son LOVES the HD camera on this thing.  At first I thought it would've been complicated to figure out, and honestly, it was for me.  However, my son got this thing up and running before I knew it. Two drawbacks. If you're up high and this thing loses satellite/wifi connection, you're screwed. It's going to take a fall.  It also doesn't do well in moderate wind, so definitely wouldn't recommend if you live in or will be using this in a very windy area.  All in all, this is a spectacular drone for a teen.

I have been practicing with the drone in close quarters in my backyard. Some breeze and my inexperience caused it to crash into a dense tree.

Seems like a sturdy little beast but hoping this was the last time doing these stunts.<br /><br />Update March 2022<br />After a year battery packs started to get tight in the drone body.

989,2.0,"Live video transmission range is really weak, otherwise a great drone.","My biggest issue with this drone is that the live video transmission (to your smart phone) while flying seems to be limited to about 100-170 meters. This is significantly less than advertised for the drone.<br /><br />Besides this issue, the drone is actually very high quality and fun to fly. The GPS system works very well. However, I do note that when the battery is low the drone will automatically take off and return to home. This is a good thing, except the drone does not fly to it's ""return to home altitude"" before flying back home. In other words, if you are not flying in a completely remote area with no obstructions in the air, when the drone hits low battery it will take off and hit into something. This is a flaw in the software I think because when you push ""return to home"" and the battery is not low, the drone will fly up to it's predetermined return to home altitude and then come back.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFMIWLU7XQORKO2Y264AURKMS5AA,1577983897254,2,True

Once it's ready to fly, it's stable, even in moderate wind, and easy to control. The included additional battery, replacement propellers, and carry case are wonderful additions, certainly at this price point. I've had the drone for only a short while, so I'm unable to offer detailed feedback on the camera and flight modes.<br /><br />One critique - the introductory video is in Chinese, and there appears to be no option to change the language settings or view subtitles. In addition, the video very clearly indicates the drone camera offers 1080P resolution (numbers in Chinese subtitles are still just numbers), which is of course contrary to the advertised resolution of 4K.

The first one I had received had an issue right at initial take-off where it did some interesting things due to a faulty motor from my assumption.

1040,5.0,Good drone for beginner and great customer service.,"We got one of these units at work and had a blast. So I decided to get myself one. The unit has great control, great video for the price, and lasts a long time in the air. I never brought it back down going, ""man this thing needs more battery"". The fact it has two batteries is even better. The drone flies and maneuvers greatly for me and was able to zoom zoom around the back yard once I figured it all out.<br />One side note is anything that gets in between it and you can hurt the camera signal but other than that it flys very far away and stable. Return to home works flawlessly.<br /><br />Now to the part about customer service. So I decided to take my drone above the tree line, and that's when I believe the battery lost connection, it might have been loose and not secure at the time. The drone fell from the sky and into a 100-foot tree. It did not come down that night and there was a very bad storm coming. I contacted support on this and within the night I got a response. The next day they asked for my address and told me a replacement will be shipped no other questions asked. This was on Dec 23rd. Today I got the new replacement drone and it works flawlessly. Just do not go over trees or water if you can help it! I would say that is A+ Service.<br />The old drone eventually fell during the 40+mph wind and rain event, and it stayed in that rain for atleast 10 hours. The battery was about 10 feet away. I let the drone and battery dry out and all works except for the camera no longer pivots. So I would say it is also very durable.<br /><br />All in all, while not a $1k drone, it works and acts like one to me. I would recommend this drone.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHTT75KUFKHCKRZF33MTAPUWVTEA,1610398911999,0,True

1122,5.0,Hands down worth the money.,I just wanted to reach out to anyone who is thinking about purchasing one of these drones. First off it's well worth the money. You get more than you do with a $150 drone. Also so far I'm not using an SD card. All my images and photos go directly to my google photos automatically. I didn't have to set anything up for that. Automatic and this is great. I'm using a Samsung note 10. In terms of a beginner? We are all beginers aren't we at one point? So if your a beginner than I recommend  this drone. It's a huge selling point that it comes with a spare battery. Also a case.  I bought a$150 drone and returned it cause it didn't offer anything. Look at YouTube videos on how to fly a drone. My advice is to look up Walking The Dog tutorial. It helps. Hands down a lot of fun. I'm 49 and enjoy taking aerial shots of my wife.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ratSE8-DL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ratSE8-DL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ratSE8-DL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gpx05oOfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gpx05oOfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gpx05oOfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEQZ6JZZQNH76LDPRQGKJTCB4MZA,1592137215324,0,True

The batteries seem like they take overnight to charge, which really limits how much flying you can do a day.<br /><br />The drone itself performs flawlessly, it's so easy to control and is very responsive.  My only complaint is sometimes it's hard to get the phone to connect to it without having to restart everything multiple times, and even in an open field you'll be lucky to get 1000-1200 ft before you lose connection and it turns back.  I believe it was advertised as up to 4k and something feet, but being limited by your phone connection ruins any chance of that.  I've seen other brands where the phone plugs into the remote so you're only limited by your remote range and not your phone range.<br /><br />Overall it's been a great device and I plan to keep it for a long time or upgrade to something with a greater range and let my kids take this one over, it's that easy to control.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d6mD8K3SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d6mD8K3SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71d6mD8K3SL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wWOLiKx-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wWOLiKx-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wWOLiKx-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEFTM6Q2XBFHP7FQ222NOHEXW4IQ,1662492725824,2,True

1135,5.0,ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT,"I've purchased those cheap drones on a couple of different occasions in the past. You know the ones that you may find in some big box stores or maybe run across randomly in the mall. The one thing they all had in common were the fact they were trash. They were all destroyed of severely damaged almost right out of the box........that being said this is not the experience I've had with the Roku F11. This is the best drone I have owned and was worth every penny I paid for it. I took it out to a local forest preserve a couple of weeks ago and I was attacked by about 9 young people. I didn't know what to do as they surrounded me. One of them quickly ran up to me and grabbed at the controller yelling that's mine give it here as the rest of the crowd circled. I thought to myself, this is it, it's been a good life! In that same moment my savior arrived seemingly out of nowhere. As she yelled out to all of those young people I felt relief immediately.....""Back up.....Give him some space"" to my surprise they all responded and did exactly what she had instructed. As it turns out daycare providers really know how to deal with large groups of 4 - 7 year old kids. Long story longer those kids really enjoyed the amateur air show I was able to provide all thanks to my Ruko F11 Gim 2 Drone. I would highly recommend this product as it is solid. I appreciate that it came with two batteries and replacement propellers all in a great case to lug it all around. Great purchase.

Control range with the controller was normally spectacular, however, the phone and video signal, in my area which give is a more crowded area and would have quite a bit of interference was around 40 to 80ft. In an area with very minimal, I could get around 200 to 400 ft and still have video transmission.<br /><br />The only issue I had, which unfortunately resulted in the loss of the drone, was the return home feature started taking the drone in the slightly wrong direction.

Out of the box, and after I'd charged the battery to full, I was flying in about 20 minutes. Very easy to sync my phone to the controller and app, sync quad to control, and calibrate the GPS. Very easy and the app is really good, functional and easy to use. The controller is well designed and makes flying very east. Flight controls are not overly sensitive but at the same time very responsive. If you let go of controls, quad hovers in place. The RTH function brings it right back home. Highly recommend this quad for adults that are new to this as I am. I'm sure after a few more practice sessions I'll be rocking and rolling.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AF2NAZUWBVA6TWE2V3S2HQDFSJNQ,1676559214060,0,True

Even my iphone11 with a slim silicone case would not stay in and even ""jumped out"" a few times while test fitting at home.

He's been having a blast finding unique places to take pictures and videos and has been improving his flying every day.  Calibrating the drone is easy, the associated app works great, and the return to home feature has been really helpful as it allows my son to land the drone automatically within a foot or two of the takeoff point. This is a great drone for someone looking for their first GPS controlled non-toy drone but isn't ready to commit a $1000 for the next level up.<br /><br />Update: After three days the drone had an issue and I had to contact customer service.

1155,5.0,Awesome drone with great features.,"I have never flown a drone, or anything remote control for that matter. I was skeptical as to how easy it would be to control and fly while still being enjoyable. I received the drone on Thursday and charged the two drone batteries and the controller battery that evening. I read the instructions and watched a couple of videos on how to fly it. I took it out Friday afternoon to the middle of a field and followed the instructions to get it set up. Within 15 minutes I was up and flying. I kept it in beginner mode as I practiced with the controls and explored several of the amazing auto features as well as taking photos and video. As I was flying at about 15 feet high and about 30 feet away, the drone started coming back toward me and I wasn't controlling it. I looked down at my phone (iPhone 11pro Max) and saw the battery meter on the drone was red. Then drone returned to within 3 feet of where it took off from and landed and shut down. I didn't even realize that I had been flying it for 26 minutes when it returned to me. I took the battery off and put the fresh battery on the drone and turned it on. My phone screen said Ready To Fly, so I started it up and took off again. I did not have to do any setup for the second flight. I took it off of beginner mode and started to explore further. I went up to 120 meters and out to a distance of about 800 meters when I lost connection to the cell phone. The camera was frozen on where it dropped the signal. It was so high and bright outside that I had no idea where it was, only the general direction it was in. I hit the return home button and waited, thinking it must have disappeared and fell. Within a couple minutes I could hear it above me, and I looked up but still couldn't see it. When i looked back to my screen, it had reconnected to the drone and I could then see where it was on the screen again. I flew it around for another 15 minutes or so and brought it back down and landed it manually this time. I am totally amazed by this product. I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before buying this drone, and it was well worth it. If you are on the fence, get down off of it and buy this drone!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PColgOgDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PColgOgDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PColgOgDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TPsEWoZ7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TPsEWoZ7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TPsEWoZ7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WMuaRjJML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WMuaRjJML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WMuaRjJML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ac4JEcoFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ac4JEcoFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ac4JEcoFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AE43P2Y635EZTZNROF5H2CR64CFQ,1578692396082,2,True

I was worried at the beginning cause I live in a fairly windy area. It handled the wind with ease. I built trust with this f11 pro pretty quick. This example was on my 1st try and on 1st battery. The battery lasted a while. I actually wanted to take a break before the battery was out cause I was so excited and had a lot of anxiety built up worrying about crashing hahahaha. But anyway, if you follow the directions you'll have no problem. Just take your time and trust this little drone. It's awesome. I can't wait to fly it again. Ordering more batteries. It comes with a nice case, the drone is made of plastic, but it's not cheap by any means at all. Has 2 batteries, plenty fun time. The camera is awesome without using your phone, with the phone the quality goes down to 720p.  I was however disappointed no video in 4k, I must have read the ad wrong. It only does 4k photos. But doesn't change my mind in the slightest. I was not expecting the quality, ease, and control I was shown. Good job Roku!

Apparently Android does not like connecting to unsecured connections without surface and automatically drops them after a minute or two. The wifi would disconnect, but the signal remained strong and I could easily reconnect...but then it would disconnect again within a minute. Got in contact with Ruko support, but they couldn't do much except shrug and say that they have problems with Samsung phones. I tried playing with every advanced setting I could find on my phone but couldn't fix the issue.

1178,5.0,"Great entry level drone, definitely worth the money!!",The quality of the drone and its agility are actually better than I was expecting. The camera video quality is very nice and it’s exceptionally easy to fly. The first time I flew it it was overcast and I had around a 10mph breeze at ground level so I imagine it was probably much windier as I climbed in altitude though the drone had absolutely no problem maintaining its fixed position even at 80 meters in the air! I would definitely recommend this drone to anyone who is seriously considering getting into the hobby as it not only is very easy to learn to fly but also has the ability to fly at much faster speeds and altitudes when your ready for those challenges!,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGR3OCNAAM656VEDXEJQ3RD7K6JA,1581523599600,0,True

The blades still are good.  Now have been able to get crashless flights in between bad weather.  Looking forward to better weather when I can take it out somewhere besides the back yard.<br /><br />It is easy to connect to wifi with an Android 10 phone.  Battery life is good, 25+ minutes of flying time.  I'm still using 'Beginner Mode' so haven't let it venture far from me.  It does seem to do well in slight breezes, and the return to home function works well.<br /><br />Room for improvement in a couple of areas:<br />The remote control, when first connecting to the phone shows low battery.  It seems to take best part of a minute for controller to report the full battery to the android app.  The drone battery seems to show properly.<br />The  manual could be improved a bit, especially regarding downloading a map and setting way points.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Would I buy this drone again.

I was able to fly at 25 mph and have had it out almost 1000 ft and it will do more.  The battery life is as advertised.  My 5 yr old grandson can fly it in beginner mode with my supervision of course.  This is so much better than the first drone I bought.  It knew one direction and that was to fly as far away from me as it could.  The console is easy to handle and simple to use.  My iphone 10 fits perfect in the slot.  There were some reviewers that thought the camera was pretty good but not the best.  I don't have much experience with that but so far the video and the stills we have taken are very good quality.  Overall this is a great buy for the money.  You get a drone that performs like the very expensive models for about $300.  I would buy again.,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AETTUXJ44NUS6MIMBOPCZ6WJHIDQ,1594327227146,0,True

1225,5.0,Totally Impressed! Highly Recommend!,"I am very impressed! I've never flown a drone before but decided to jump in with two feet. The quality of the drone is excellent. The instructions are very simple to understand and it's almost impossible to crash it with the GPS enabled. On day 2, I flew it across our lake to my friend's house and back using the GPS waypoints. I even had it follow me around the neighborhood while I drove my golf cart. If you get scared all you have to do is press the home button and it will come right back and land. I'm looking forward to using it to film our family and friends while they are wakeboarding and tubing.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m8TySwP9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m8TySwP9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m8TySwP9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VDhBnb4BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VDhBnb4BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VDhBnb4BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFYT6QOUPI44RLWOS7DMMJCAF4NA,1603576064048,1,True
1226,4.0,"Easy to fly, long battery life and durable","I have had this now for over week and have flown it nearly everyday. I bought a different drone prior to purchasing this and only had it for about week and after receiving two faulty drones I bought this Ruko and it has been great, but it’s not as stable as the first drone. Mine came with 2 batteries and they last a very long time. It’s very easy to fly. I’m a first time drone owner (not including the drone I had for about a week before this). The only reason i give 4 stars is it’s not as stable as I think it should be and it takes about 1 minute to calibrate before each flight. The picture quality is decent for the price, but not movie quality or for taking  portraits. I clipped a masonry wall today and 30 seconds later had it back in the air. All in all it’s a great durable  little drone and I recommend to anyone not wanting to spend over $1,000.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QeTcwzEgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QeTcwzEgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QeTcwzEgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b8uT+eP4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b8uT+eP4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71b8uT+eP4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHBD6JR3DKQZP3IA6L5TI3AD7PJQ,1603077881826,0,True

1229,5.0,Excellent High Quality Drone and Easy to Fly for Beginners and Advanced,"My Roku drones have been an absolute joy to fly! I first got the U11 and enjoyed it so much I then got the F11 Pro for the increased distance and having an extra drone for my kids to fly with me at the park. I've flown it in some pretty strong cross winds around 15-20mph and it stayed surprisingly stable. The initial setup to calibrate the sensors is a bit of a pain and takes some getting used to but once you get it down it's not a big deal. There's some good Youtube videos out there that walk you through the process pretty well as the instructions aren't as good as having someone show you on video. But once you get that drone up and flying, it is an absolute blast. It's so easy to fly with the GPS keeping it stable and the auto-land function is spot on. Wherever the drone is, once you hit that button it literally lands exactly where it took off from in the exact same orientation. Heck, it's so easy to fly my five year old son was taking off, flying and landing it with hardly any assistance. My brother was so impressed he ended up buying the higher end Ruko F11 GIM that comes with an even better feature packed controller. You do need to get registered with the FAA for this type of drone but the process was easier than I thought. I did it all online with the FAA and it was only $5. Once you get your license number from the FAA you just have to write that number somewhere on all your drones and you're good to fly up to 500 feet as long as it's not over top groups of people. Roku customer service was a great experience as well. The drones come with a card for a free battery after you post a review, I emailed about the free battery for my earlier U11 drone purchase and they sent a free battery right away. Aside from a high quality, feature packed and great priced drone, It's refreshing having a company like this that honors there promises for extra freebies. Thanks Ruko!!! Ruko will be my one stop shop for all my future drone purchases.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1FltNJWeeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1FltNJWeeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1FltNJWeeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEZ24DNUS2TOFLGAHNYDEX5RAJSQ,1613692737273,0,True

However, you know it is money well spent if the features and the performance back up the price.<br /><br />This drone comes with 60 minutes of flight time. That alone is enough to make you buy it. While many of its peers come with battery time of 20 minutes, the F11 Pro triples that. From a single battery, you are going to get 30 minutes of flight time.

In looking at the amenities of the different models available on amazon, it quickly became evident, that buying something in the low budget area would probably only serve to become something of a frustration. We actually upped our budget to purchase this drone based on the reviews that we have read.<br /> That all being said, this is an amazing and fun form of entertainment. And even beyond that, it will be a useful tool when putting together videos for both personal, and business use.<br />Setting up and calibrating the unit was easy, and the instructions were clear. It is important to follow the instructions exactly how they say. We are still in the learning curve of the expanded controls, and it is pretty awesome that you can view in real time what the camera is seeing overhead through the app on your phone.<br />It's important to consider your surroundings when flying, especially when you're learning. The controls are very accurate, and the smallest movement of the joystick will direct the unit in a very responsive way. Equally, until you have a good grasp of the sensitivity of your controls, I would suggest keeping your unit within your site until you've gained enough experience to venture out to its full capacity.<br />I would definitely recommend this to family and friends that are in the market for a drone. I have wanted one for a few years now, and this has not disappointed.<br />We are so looking forward to the first camping trip of the summer, as this is one of the reasons that we made this purchase.

1260,5.0,Indestructible-Great for Novices,"I am a 69 year-old complete novice to drones with no other air radio-control device experience.  With help from YouTube videos for the F11 Pro, I have been able to greatly exceed my expectations for flying and shooting pictures/videos during my first few hours.  I made some early beginner mistakes and can certify that the F11 is nearly indestructible.  My propellers got badly bruised but did not break.  Also, it does return home.<br /><br />The primary use for my F11 Pro drone is to monitor the progress on large commercial, industrial and roadway projects for personal interest and enjoyment on weekends when there is no construction activity.  This drone can do that very well from the perimeter of the sites.<br /><br />One work around I encountered was that my iPhone 12 Pro Max 5G phone with case was too big for the F11 flight control phone holder.  The 5G & 4G both work great with the controller with T-Mobile service in Metro Atlanta.  The attached picture shows two containers obtained from the office supply and food storage container areas at Walmart.  The work around provided a solution to minimize the impact of sunlight glare on the phone screen while flying the drone and provide a comfortable flight box for the pilot.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Ycvz5d1hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Ycvz5d1hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Ycvz5d1hL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEAT3KA2T6KUXJBDQAO3XZDLNRMA,1621763156173,1,True

Will update later if anything changes.<br /><br /> I spent the evening reading the manual thoroughly last night everything seemed straight forward and I felt comfortable being prepared to fly the next day.<br /><br />I previously had a DJI Phantom that was given to me by my brother. While is was a more expensive drone with more bells and whistles, set up and flying was much more of a learning curve. I eventually crashed it after two week and destroyed it. I was nervous about getting another one but decided to try this one out because of the lower price point. I was worried about the 2 axis cam vs 3 axis cam but figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />Set up and calibration was easy this morning after becoming familiar with the manual material. Everything works and drone is very responsive. I was able to take of, fly and land with zero issues. Spent about 25 minutes playing with it on my lunch break. VERY happy with the extras on this drone considering the price point. Camera video is GREAT.  Over-all very happy with this purchase.

The 30-minute battery flew for 22-minutes before the low battery alarm sounded providing ample time for the GPS Return-to-Home feature to return the F11 to its takeoff spot.<br /><br />My rating was 4-Stars because of a very inadequate Flight Manual. It is difficult to read and lacks much detail. Some areas are to brief. What you must do is to research additional sources to gain a full understanding of what this drone will and will not do. It is what you don’t know that will get you into trouble.<br /><br />Each strength has a limitation. If you are a “quick start “ guide operator, you are headed for trouble. A good Flight Manual will detail limitations and provide numerous cautions and recovery procedures. This Manual is not adequate for this.<br /><br />The F11 Pro is very easy and fun to fly.

You will get almost 30 min out of both depending on what you're doing. I flew it when I first got it and it arrived at night time lol. I bought a $50 drone awhile back just to get the feel of one, got boring real quick lol, so when I flew this one I picked up quick.. BUT it's definitely easy if you never flew one. The uploaded video does the view no justice. It's extremely clear but it's a fish bowl view if you're picky.. I don't care, it's clear and it's good enough for me. The range is INSANE! The video is me flying out of my neighborhood over to the next and that was only 140m at 100ft in the air, the max is 1200m!!!!.<br /><br />Now I gave it 3 stars because today when I flew it (day number 3) It had a couple hiccup's. I flew it out about 100m 80ft and the screen frozen. I exited the app (don't worry you're drone will hover in place until it's given a Command) reopen and the screen was still frozen, had to call it back home. Now don't freak out you're drone will ascend to 100ft before coming back, this just to ensure there's a clear path.<br /><br />2nd... In follow me mode.. it was flying sideways and wouldn't allow me to straighten it out. Then when I turned around to walk in the other direction. It turned around but swung completely too far out and slammed into the side of my house. So one of feet is slightly slanted but no biggie, it's a replaceable part.<br /><br />3rd the maps will not open up. The box pops up but it's grey. No arrow, no terrain, just a grey box. So I have to my point of interest the manual way<br /><br />Update::<br /><br />I don't if I have a bad drone or not but the max distance I got mines to go up too was about 357 meters and that's at about 100ft in the air. The video freeze and it says radio signal lost, than returns home even though it's showing me a strong signal still.. that's pretty disappointing , especially for the money I spent. I got this drone for the range and it's not even doing half of the distance it's supposed to<br /><br />Update #2<br /> So after my review of this product, the manufacturer reach out to me personally expressing they're concern in my disappointment.

1301,5.0,Well built and solid.,"This drone was purchased mainly so I could learn about flying a more advanced drone and I was impressed with many things about the product when I received it. Here are some highlights:<br />1. It is very sturdy and is more stable in the air because of its weight and powerful motors.<br />2. I have limited testing on the Return feature but so far has landed with inches of the launch point.<br />3. Speed on this drone in the beginner mode is faster than I thought it would be however it is still easily controllable<br />4. The written instructions are unambiguous and come on the inside lid of the original box, in the instruction manual, and also on the app and besides, there is a quick-start guide enclosed in the box. The only drawback is the video instructions which are well done, but the voice recording should be re-recorded because the speaker is not a native English speaker, but you don't need that to enjoy your drone anyway.<br />5. The carrying case easily fits in a backpack or a suitcase and is quite sturdy and has compartments for an extra battery. It is equipped with a strap for easy carrying by hand.<br />6. I haven't done much with the camera yet but I have been impressed with its low light performance. I would not worry about flying even at dusk if necessary.<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality drone and does not wish to get into the thousand dollars plus range.

It is easy to control and handle, the GPS feature functions great and keeps the drone in place.

I cannot complain about battery life considering everything that the drone is doing at the time.<br /><br />I did have an issue with the controller, or I thought I did. The second time I used it the app showed the controller battery was dead.  I contacted Ruko about this issue as I felt I had a bad controller. They were quick to respond and explained why they felt the controller was showing a dead/low battery. Basically I did not follow the steps for turning everything on and connecting the phone to the drone WiFi.  I tried again, following the steps they outlined in the email which were the same as the instructions, and everything worked great.

First off, I had only briefly flown my son's small drone, and didn't have much experience flying drones, but this Ruko F11 Pro drone is perfect for beginners. Taking off and landing are the hardest parts, but it self-stabilizes itself once you get it into the air. The camera is great, clear photos and videos even at high altitudes. I was very impressed, especially for the price take, I was expecting to have to get a drone well over $500 to get the quality I needed, but this met my criteria at a much lower cost. I had so much fun using it for work, I decided to buy another one for my sons to play with. Also, seems to be very durable because I did happen to fly into a couple objects (tree branch and powerline) and it crashed to the ground, and kept on ticking, although with a few exterior blemishes, and some nicks in the blades, but that just gives it character. Overall, great drone that I recommend. The only negative I would have is that Ruko needs to come out with a drone that has its camera on a 3-axis gimbal for better video action shots and and less swaying during video recording and flying (stopping/ turning).",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEGBZHM3YNJLWE4VY7HYWGN4T6NQ,1606866632127,1,True

It's excellent camera and flight stability have allowed me to use it to inspect my roof, and take some great aerial shots.<br /><br />If you are looking for a photo drone that has enough intelligence to hover stably, this is the drone for you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71a1ixTM47L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71a1ixTM47L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71a1ixTM47L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFLTWIWYNW6D3DLULSVERAOAS7UA,1671735930106,0,True

1341,5.0,Easy to learn,"I have never flown a drone in my life. It took me a couple of tries, and a few restarts, but I was confidently flying this drone by my third session (days apart). The most important thing for me was making sure the Bluetooth connection was set properly. The directions were spot on, be sure to read them several times if you are new to flying a drone. Whenever I had a problem (other than the Bluetooth) it was because I forgot one of the steps. The carry case it came with is wonderful because It makes it so easy to pack and take with me.  I watched a video with the person using a tablet and I would like to find the accessory to use that with the remote.<br /><br />Things I would change would be the camera video lens, it has too much of a fish eye lens for my preference. I purchased this drone for photography and art. I love the carry case that came with it, but the cut outs for the extra battery and blades only work when the items stay in the boxes they came in. They are not sturdy boxes, so plan on buying extra foam to help these items stay in place once the boxes have given out.<br /><br />The first time I crashed into some trees I ended up putting a small chip in one of the blades. The drone still flies great, but I'm monitoring them to see how much abuse they will take.

Beginners mode limits your range and other functionality.  You'll need to connect to the drones own wifi on your smartphone in order to view the camera or do any of the fun stuff, but you can still fly it without it.<br /><br />It is so much fun looking down on yourself from hundreds of feet up.  Adjusting the camera, looking around the area, flying around.  It even supports VR, although I haven't gotten around to trying it just yet.  Gosh, just imaginging VR from sky high altitudes sounds fun!<br /><br />Camera is slightly fisheye at the edges just so you know what you're getting into.

I am a complete novice when it come to drones so I bought this drone based on reviews. And I was not disappointed. The drone works great!<br />A couple of times the gps went wonky and it crashed a few times. I’ve gone through the spare propellers because the drone doesn’t like its propellers messed up. They get stuck on each other  in flight when they have dings on them and causes crashes. The app is super buggy I haven’t been able to get most of the functions to work properly but for the FPV it’s awesome. Hopefully ruko is working on a fix for this.

The controls are very intuitive and satellite connection holds the drone steady when hovering and returns to home within a couple of feet of the launch point. The camera works well and video is easy use.  The WiFi connection through the app is also very easy to set up. Flight duration is pretty much as advertised, not quite 30 min but pretty close.  Although the transmitter can control the drone for over a kilometer you will lose the WiFi connection and video through the app at around 500m which can make it difficult to figure out if the drone is flying toward you or further away from you but “return to home” will always fly it right back. Overall I’d highly recommend this drone and for the price, I don’t think you can do any better. The icing on the cake is Ruko stands behind their product.

Equally impressive that it goes into a stationary hover position when you let off the controls giving the novice a change to reorient themselves.  Just a little disappointed that it returns to with the 100’ geofence due to battery level while it still has 10 to 15 minutes of flight time left.<br /><br />I do encourage buyers to get the extra battery and propellers.  Battery is Handley to extend the fun.  The propellers are just in case.  Had a couple of hard landings ( read crashes) and the drone has proven to be very robust.  I haven’t needed the propellers yet but it is good to have them.,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFAN3PAKQ3CEY7KVHI7367WBFKPQ,1637886510900,0,True

The batteries are advertised as lasting 25-28 minutes. In my experience, that is true. Conditions such as wind, speed setting, video use all affect the time.<br />The drone weighs in at 518 grams. The micro sd card (not included) needs to be 32gb or less.  The camera lens is very wide - 120 degrees. The video saved on the sd card is 2K, video saved on phones is 720 (samples attached).<br />Control is easy to master and the remote is responsive.

The instructions are clear and the controls are intuitive.  It is nice that if you let go of the sticks, it hovers (key thing to make sure kids know, don't panic, just let go of the sticks).  Video quality was great.  They can't wait to experiment with the features (follow me, VR view, etc.).  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.

She has an iphone 7 plus and has to take it out of the case for it to fit.<br /><br />A couple of notes:<br />- one of the pictures almost makes the drone look chrome because of the lighting, it is just black<br />- if you are flying and feel like the orientation of the controls is ""off"" (as in forward on the stick does not go forward), you probably hit the compass button and put it headless mode (look in the instructions and you will find how to correct it)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TJrXfBz7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TJrXfBz7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TJrXfBz7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHIPM5A42TAMMYELTEVRLT52VHPQ,1599763676818,0,True

1448,5.0,One of if not thee best drone in the market.,"This is one, if not thee easiest drone to date that I have piloted and goofed around on. The video quality is clear and crisp with not much lag or shacking when using your phone to virtually see through the drones camera. I did notice when I used my phone (Samsung Note 20 ultra 5g) I had longer range and better connectivity then I was to use my son's phone (iphone 8) that dropped the connectivity about 1/2 to 2/3rds the distance. I have bought the company's other drone the u11 for fun and it outperformed  my expectations especially the GPS feature when I would lose signal flying to far or when the wind would pick up and take my drone away (living in Seattle during the winter) the GPS would kick in and fight its way back to where I toke off from and hover right where I would be standing requesting to land. I have had it stuck in the rain mid flight and gotten it home safe with no issues even though it's not recommended to fly in the rain if you get stuck in a down pour it'll be OK just get it back to land home and dry it off and you shouldn't have any issues, I haven't and I flown several times in the rain cause let's face it we all are kids at heart and want to play with our new toys all the time that's why we get them.<br /><br /> Overall this is the best high quality drone I personally flown for a low-mid budget price out there and I flown several r/c planes, drones, quadcopters, helicopters if the price is just a little to much and your unsure how you will be piloting a drone then I suggest to try out the Ruko U11 first and get a feel with the GPS feature and then step it up if you wish with this drone. Tmhe sizes are slightly different as seen in the photo I toke but overall same security feeling knowing your drone will Come home back to you and not go flying into the sunset never to be seen again, until you watch the news and see it being reported come crashing down hitting a jogger or bicyclist in the head.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A17vExHIv5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A17vExHIv5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A17vExHIv5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEUEM3B2QG66JP6JJUZ76O34BW5A,1613561540178,0,True

1468,5.0,Very easy to fly,"This is my first drone ever. I've researched other drones, mostly on Amazon, and finally decided on this one because it is portable, has an easy to use app, has fairly good camera functions, and extended flight time.  I especially like it that it can stay in the air almost 30 min. per full battery charge. Realistically it is more like 15-20 min. because of wind conditions and how aggressive you want to fly the drone.<br /><br />Out of the box, I crashed it twice.  That's because this is my first drone, but since then, I haven't crashed it. It was easy enough to learn after you get a hang of it.  I'm still discovering little tidbits about this drone.

1471,5.0,"Easy set up, intuitive controls... only complaint is remote battery life","Received as Christmas gift.  I charged it over night and did my first 4 runs the next day.  Setup:  Follow the instructions closely.  They are not the best instructions, but if you read it closely and follow step by step, this really is an easy set up.  Tip:  Use the Ruko 2 page start up card when setting up and download the app before you start (search for SJ GPS Pro).  Flight:  The first time, I didnt use my app.  That was dumb.  Flip up the phone clasp in the middle of the remote and use the app, much more intuitive for me than the remote as I am getting used to everything.  Also, be mindful of the preset flight parameters (only configurable via the app as far as I can tell) as they are set for ""beginner mode"".  Once you get the hang of things, you will want to increase the distance and altitude (I believe you must do so when connected to the drone).  Remote:  So far, the remote has been the limiting factor on flight time. After my 3rd flight (a total of 15 mins max), the remote started beeping as the power was low.  I then didn't have control of the drone and it just hovered (at a very high altitude), I hit the down controls... nothing... I hit return to home... nothing... so I ran back inside and connected the remote to the charger and hit return to home and by the time I got outside, it was coming down to the launching point.  Thankfully, I wasn't in some remote area with no power.  Could have been user error by not charging the remote enough, but I will carry a powerbank with me when I take it out.  Overall, after 4 flights, I would say this thing is pretty awesome for beginners.  My primary problem is that I can see myself wanting to upgrade pretty quickly!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cdj0Mot5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cdj0Mot5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cdj0Mot5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFCMRZGIX7JF6NP7AZU2FXE4YSUA,1577396540724,0,False

The stability of the drone isn't 100% perfect, especially in windy conditions, but for the price, I'd say it's more than adequate (like 95% perfect). The controls are slightly tricky at first, at least for an absolute beginner. However, after one or two test flights, I feel quite confident in my piloting abilities. Also, the extra functions (ex: target tracking, route mapping) are unexpectedly nifty and work like a charm!<br /><br />Additionally, the customer support has been very helpful and quick to reply. 5/5 stars on that front.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great drone for beginners or intermediates who want a great balance of quality vs. price.

I purchased two 2500mAh batteries that I can fly about 60 minutes.

1508,5.0,Great drone,"I've had this drone for a few months now and it has worked very well.  I am using my Motorola phone and have not had any issues with connections.  It connects every time.  This is my first drone and I am very happy with how easy it is to fly and land.  I have flown it in winds as high as 20 mph gusts and it is more challenging to fly but seems to handle it fine.  I received an email from the seller right after I purchased it and they are very polite and prompt in answering questions.  I recently thought I was having a battery problem with the remote and sent them an email.  I had a response within hours with things for me to try and if it did not help they would take care of it.  It ended up being a mistake on my part so I'm up and flying again.  The customer service is great and in my opinion one of the most important things when purchasing.  If you have a great product and no service, better hope it never fails.<br /><br />I chose to purchase this drone after looking at the Mavic pro for some time.  I just could not get myself to spend that much more for my first drone but also didn't want to just waist money on something that would be of no use.  This drone is great and will help me better know what I truly need for my applications prior to spending more money.  With this said, this drone had a nice camera but it is not gymbled.  If you are hovering over your target or just taking scenic video it is not much of a problem.  But I takes work to move it into place and have the good photo angle since when you move the drone it changes the camera angle.  It also does not have any sensors which is not much of an issue for me since I am not flying it to far away from me and can still see where it is.  If you plan on flying it far or in tight areas, that would be a needed feature.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drone for a first timer or if you are not completely sure of what options you rally need.  As I progress in my needs and get the funds to upgrade I probably will.  This will make a great backup or the one I can have my kids work with so if there is a large mistake it will not be as large of a loss.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHVQ7IEATUMIF3SRQO6VW3DXLLMA,1577990403869,4,True

Thing is, it arrived with only one battery and was supposed to have two batteries. Amazon wouldn't send just a battery replacement, so I had to return for a whole new replacement unit. The second Ruko drone did not fly properly. The calibration appeared to be off, so the control stick steered unpredictably. Several times the drone seemed to have a mind of its own and flew off at high speed in random directions. Finally it crashed itself into a parking lot and broke into tiny pieces.

1542,5.0,Great Purchase!,"This drone has a great camera (see pic) and is so easy to use. The batteries last much longer than expected. The GPS is on point and the remote is actually very easy to control. This is my first drone and I have had so much fun with it. I was flying within an hour of opening the box.It arrived right on time in perfect condition. I use it to annoy the geese on our pond and it works great for that. I have had several wipe outs, hitting houses, trees and the ground but the drone is still going strong. I couple of times I hit so hard I thought sure it would be ruined. Nope. Like a champ it started flying with no problems. I highly recommend this drone! I have owned this drone for over a month and it is still working like it did on day one.

This is a must have and in my opinion outperforms the mavic tello and mini.. a must have drone be sure to use the ad card and charge and follow directions.. rememberyou must of fly this outdoors for the GPS and most app functions to work properly.. also note it's set to beginner so turn that off for full distance capabilities.. great job Ruko,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEEJCSZPL56ZC55EHU3WPSPHYJYQ,1590719128538,0,True

1555,5.0,Yes this is another one saying it’s awesome,"I have had this a couple weeks and it just gets better.  I have flown numerous entry level drones and hands down this is the best.  I recommend a few things.  Read the instructions or at least watch the videos for best results.  With that said, It took my 15 year old son 5 minutes after watching the video to having it in the air.  It has a beginner mode that keeps the unit from getting away from you.  We had it on that mode for at least 10 minutes before we turned it off.  The unit is so easy and stable you really don’t need a beginner mode.<br /><br />1 thing that I didn’t plan on was that my phone was to big for the top mount of the remote.  It fit when I removed the case but a smaller phone like the iPhone SE would have fit much easier without the need to remove the case.<br /><br />I will probably buy another one just to get more air time instead of taking turns with the family.  Who would have thought 2 batteries (over an hour) would not be enough.

The fishing line is then used to hoist heavier antenna guy lines.<br /><br />I'll offer a few suggestions here:  In my search for a drone,  I read many stories how they just flew away never to be seen again, on the first time out.  With that in mind, I first labeled all the controls as shown in the picture.  Even then, it was still confusing, but after 3 days of play at low elevation around my yard I got the hang of it.  Only then did I go up to 100ft as shown in the attached pictures.  I also picked a wind-still day which I recommend for precision positioning.

At first I believed that I would have to calibrate this drone each time I flew it, but that is not the case. After the initial setup and getting everything synced it has been a smooth startup process ever since. The photos are from this being set up on the beginner level.

1608,5.0,The perfect beginner drone,"[[VIDEOID:28d2e306c56f78770642c4b08b956cea]] There's a lot to love with this drone, and very little not to love. If you've never bought a drone before and you're thinking about getting this one: just do it! You wont regret it.<br /><br />This thing is super easy to fly, super fun to fly, packed with features, and has an amazing camera! Having 30 minutes of flight time on each battery is plenty to get good videos/pictures, and swapping them out is trivially easy.<br /><br />I will say, however, that recording video directly to my Galaxy S10 will only give me videos in 720p. This really isn't too big of a deal though, because it will record in 2K to an SD Card.<br /><br />Speaking of the SD Card, I couldn't seem to actually find anywhere in the manual that talked about where to put an SD Card into the Drone! So, I've uploaded a picture with this review to show you where it should be. Wasn't too hard to figure out, but it definitely had me confused for a second.<br /><br />=== Flight Quality ===<br /><br />I bought this drone for myself for Christmas, and thus have only flown for a little bit during the winter here in Washington State. This means cold temperatures, bits of rain/snow, and pretty modest winds. I have had no trouble with this thing fighting the wind at all. There was one occasion where I attempted to fly it before allowing to get a good GPS signal, which caused it to drift a bit during takeoff, however that was my mistake for being in such a rush, and it quickly figured out where it was and stabilized. Overall, I am extremely impressed with how accurate the GPS is on this drone, especially since I am mostly flying it out in the sticks where GPS seems to usually have problems.<br /><br />=== Camera Quality ===<br /><br />The camera is absolutely nothing to laugh at. Having such a wide FOV allows you to get some pretty seriosuly good looking landscape shots, and recording videos on 2K is beautiful. However, I definitely recommend using video editing software to remove the fish eye effect from the wide FOV, and to fix some of the shakiness that can occur while the drone is flying. I've also found that videos will want to automatically color correct, which can be a small annoyance.<br /><br />=== Features ===<br /><br />I think I use the waypoint feature every single time I fly this drone. It is absolutely phenomenal, and lends itself to taking beautiful panning shots. I haven't used the other features quite as much, but when I have. I've found them very straightforward, and they worked very well. Additionally, I once tried to film a sunrise by positing the drone above my backyard pointed east, then leaving the controller and walking inside. It filmed for about ten minutes, then suddenly lost signal. I was pretty paranoid about this the whole time, so I was able to find my drone and get reconnected right away. However, when I did, i noticed that it simple flew back over my house to where I had launched it, then begun landing itself. If I had done nothing, I could have simply walked outside and found my drone perfectly safe sitting where I launched it. This is a huge peace of mind feature for me, and I was really impressed with how well it worked. Kudos to SJRC for that one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tCJ1SiN7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tCJ1SiN7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tCJ1SiN7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71al7hrpocL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71al7hrpocL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71al7hrpocL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEJUALOG44JYD4GQ3RVPWJBVXJRA,1578846927464,3,True

1615,5.0,Good drone overall but there’s a few small problems,"It flies very well in gps mode. It stays very stable midair and you have much control over the drone. However, in the “altitude mode” it’s extremely hard to control and keep stable. When I first took it out of the package I followed all of the pairing steps prior to launch but when I turned on the propellers and pressed the launch button, it immediately flew into the house and crashed. I’m not sure what happened but I haven’t had a problem with that since. None of the follow-me modes are useful unless you’re in a completely open field... because there’s no object avoidance. I’d personally spend a few extra hundreds on a drone with object avoidance, as it helps a ton! Overall good drone for the money. The videos are decent. The WiFi isn’t as strong as the company claims. You start losing connection to your phone about 150 feet away, even in completely open airspace. Also the remote they sent me must have a defective battery or something because it always says it has low voltage about 5 minutes into flying, no matter how long I charge it.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFG367MPIQREZIAJ6YGOQJIWCW4A,1573096548923,0,True

Then after landing and taking off a couple times, the next time I took off it made a noise at me and rose about 40 or 50 meters in the air and then started flying off towards the west.  It rose high enough to clear the trees in the surrounding area and disappeared into god knows where.<br /><br />Long story short be careful, though I am not sure how to be careful if the safety protocols don't work.

1657,5.0,Good Drone - For the most part,"I've had this drone for almost one month now.<br /><br />In the month I took it out 4 times.<br /><br />First Flight went without a hitch.<br /><br />Second Flight, the drone struggled in some wind. I activated the return to home, and it started to come back. However, when it had reached approximately 25 feet from me, it it had gone into a POI Orbit, and spiraled down till it crashed from around 4 feet off the ground. Let me explain a little: I had gone off roading, and had a clear view below and around me, no one in sight, No Power lines, no WiFi interference, cell data yes. I had ONLY activated the Return to Home function, and released the sticks of the controller maintaining line of sight the entire time.<br /><br />I had contacted Ruko due to the weird return to home incident.<br /><br />My next flight was 6 days later, fully charged batteries. the first 23mins battery was fine, no problems. The second battery was installed, drone was sent out to the same areas as it was just a few minutes ago. During Hover, hands off the sticks, drone banked suddenly and hard crashed into the side of small mountain. Live Video showed what appeared to be a cracked lens. I was able to use the GPS map to retrieve my drone, no visible signs of damage to the drone or camera. Except for the drone felt HOT to touch. After letting the drone cool down at home, and recharging my battery, I decided to power it up and check the camera. I was surprised it powered on, motors spooled right up, and image was undamaged. However, the camera could not pitch down, or pitch up (when manual adjustment)<br /><br />Next flight was a week later, I had replaced the camera. Again, first 23mins of flight (battery) was good, no problems. It was not until the 2 second battery did the drone exhibit incorrect response to stick movements.<br /><br />Example;  I applied forward stick, the drone went backwards to the right; Back stick, forward to the left. Not sure what had happened since I changed nothing, except to put in a fresh battery. Controllers charge was still almost full, according to the app on my mobile phone.<br /><br />I have heard back from Ruko about the weird return to home, and they of course said there was nothing wrong in the data log for that flight. So, I am not sure what to think.<br /><br />Picture quality:<br />it is advertised as 4K; lol, even my mobile phone reports it as only 1080p video and photos.<br /><br />Return to home:<br />even after calibration, and satellites check on app; when it lands, it is over 3feet from the landing pad, in NO winds.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHPLRA7WC25CL5OEYLB2VKUIQDYA,1598154806095,0,True

1659,5.0,"My First Drone, A Great Experience!","I've always wanted a drone and I decided to go with this Ruko drone. For a first time drone owner I can say that it is not too difficult to learn to operate with a little patience, as there is a learning curve. But once you get it down, flying the drone becomes second-nature and it is very fun! I love taking amazing photos with it; the type of photos that you can't take if you aren't the owner of a drone. Definitely cool to show off to family and friends too. So if you're an avid photographer, or you're interested in avionics, or just want to have a good time, a drone is the way to go. And this Ruko F11 Pro drone is definitely quality and well built. I've only flown it a handful of times but I know it's going to last.

It follows the flight path I set and when I want it back, I just have to press the “return to home” button and it lands almost exactly where it took off from.  Cool.

1665,5.0,Pretty much flies itself,"I decided that I wanted longer flying times and not with small helicopters and quad copters indoors. The setup for each flight is printed on a card and it tells you what to do once you sync WiFi on the phone screen, so it goes quickly. It was easy to learn because when you let go of the controls the drone stays stable in the air where it was, and you can read the instructions and continue with your flight or with the new feature you just read about like Follow Me, and the drone will follow you around your neighborhood on your bike. This came with 2 batteries and, using video length as a timer, they both average 24 minute flights. I figure that as a beginner you waste energy and the flights will be longer once I'm more gentle on the controls. The return button works as advertised; the drone flies straight up to its max height, goes directly over its starting point, and comes straight down to land within 2 feet of where it launched.

1685,5.0,"Buy this drone - stop looking & comparing, just click ""buy"" and fly happy","Its not often that I'm surprised, well, there was that one time my grandma vaulted over a mini-pony to get to the last cream-puff before the dog ate it, but aside from that, its unusual. In this case though I can say without hesitation that I was surprised. Given the vast list of features that typically demand premium prices, to say nothing of the case, battery and folding functionality, I figured costs had to have been cut somewhere - like propellers are extra or you're only buying a picture of the drone, with a scratch and sniff sections where you can smell the summer breeze that you'd be flying in.....if you had propellers.  It was with no small surprise then and all too rare bested expectations,  when I opened the box to find the F11 Pro every bit the quality machine its claimed to be.  The build quality is exceptional, it feels twice the price you pay. There's nothing cheap or flimsy about this aerial juggernaut, in fact before the flight test I wondered if something so....robust....could actually lumber into the air, let alone fly - but I'd be proved wrong on that score. Everything looks carefully crafted, form and function by design and purpose, as opposed to whatever injection mold was kicking around the shop.  The case is good, everything fits well and even here, something that is often an afterthought thing ""thrown in""  you can see there is attention to detail and a bias toward doing it right.<br /><br />Unfolding the drone takes a bit of thought - I mean, not Mensa-level, but there is an order to it, and in another nod to quality, you're going to need to apply some effort  - not ""Earl, get the sledge"" effort, but the ""arms"" positively move into place and you won't be doing it with one finger - unless you have a really strong finger, like a body-builder, but just your finger....like your finger works out, but the rest of you doesn't. Unfolding the controller is actually as near a work of art as unfolding a controller can be - reminds me of a transformer...auto-bot, obviously.<br /><br />Lets get down to brass-tacks though because as Humphrey Bogart once said, ""design doesn't add up to a hill of beans in this crazy town, if the drone won't fly""  - I'm not sure Bogart said anything even close to that actually, but if they had drones in 1942, he would have - but I digress.  The start-up procedure for this drone is a little more involved than some lesser models, where the start-up procedure is basically ""turn it on"".  This however is a more sophisticated machine and so your ""pre-flight"" is going to be more involved as well - and you want it to be.....it means the drone has complex systems, and just like any pre-flight check, its important to know that they are working and calibrated. That said, its relatively simple -basically comprised of turning in a circle and moving the control sticks - the instructions, app and quick-start guide on the inside of the box lid all do a great job of walking you through it.<br /><br />Flying this drone is is what drone flying should be, but so often isn't. I have four drones and at least half are fair-weather only. Did someone sneeze fourteen miles away? Best not fly because the drone will be sent careening into a hedge. What's that?a perfect day with no wind? great....lets get our 8 minutes of flying in.  Seriously, some drones seem more designed to have you take up another hobby, than fly drones. Fortunately, the F11 Pro makes flying fun. First, it laughs in the face of a breeze - it is basically a flying brick folks, and bricks don't take shtick from any mere gust of wind. Second, it will fly for about 28 minutes on a battery....28 minutes... that's almost 29 minutes, which is almost 30! AND you get a second battery in the box....so ....take 28, carry the four, find the square root of your mom's meatloaf and TADA!.....near as makes no difference, an hour of flight...IN THE BOX.  I found all the flight features to be better than expected and more fun than I had thought - better yet though, is that you can actually fly this drone properly, outside, in the real world, and for longer than it takes some kid to say ""hey nice drone, can I fly it""? To which you must automatically respond ""Heck no kid, buzz off,...and.....tell mommy I'm on an important call, not to be disturbed for another 27 minutes"".<br /><br />I won't go into all the features, you can read them yourself, they are there, they work.  What is important here though is that this drone is worth every penny you spend, and yes, it is more expensive than some lesser models, but those are the ones that don't fly well, or crash if uncle Dave toots in your general direction. It also flies for a long time, in a way that's controllable and adjustable for varied skill  - and not just because it can go faster or slower, but because it has multiple features designed to make you successful and enjoy flying, almost as if that were the point.<br /><br />I have no affiliation with the brand, I bought the drone with my own hard-earned cash and I write reviews for products that deserve them.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGK73PXBCDHJFVCCPIYNLMZDNTIA,1593849862029,43,True

AMAZING FLIGHT TIME, FEATURES, and ITS GREAT FOR BEGINNERS!!

I learned real quick step back lol. But when I finally got it in the air and setup was so easy...when i got it in the air...wow.<br /><br />Now, I was surprised cause I couldn't go as high or fly as far at first...well, that's because this AMAZING feature called BEGINNER MODE... lol. So it limits the height and distance...which gives you a chance to learn how to use it.

1723,5.0,My 4-year old can fly it.,"I got this drone because the reviews made it seem like a good choice for beginners.  The reviews were right!  I needed about 20 minutes of practice (this is my first drone although I've flown a couple of my friends for a few minutes) and then I was ready to fly it with my boys (4 and 2.5 years old).<br /><br />The 4-year old was almost immediately able to fly it and he loves the ""return and land"" feature.  He thinks that's very cool.  My 2.5-year old had a little more trouble but that's mostly because he just doesn't have fine motor control so he's jerky on the controller.  But even he was able to fly it.<br /><br />I didn't understand the beginner mode at first but, now that I do, it's a great feature.  Basically, with it on you can't lose the drone.  It hits 30 meters and just reverses.  It means I don't have to worry about the boys accidentally flying past their sight.<br /><br />The camera features work well.  Took a bunch of pictures and texted them to Grandma and the Uncles.<br /><br />The flight time seems about accurate.  With the two charged batteries we basically played until I was tired, even if the boys wanted to go longer.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun, solid, well-built, drone at a reasonable price look no further.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHON7C67EVWH5B2VBBK4EGA2UFYA,1586295961858,0,True

1732,4.0,First Drone I’ve owned,"[[VIDEOID:2f100e0dd0e6bc78fcc6b6136241cbd3]] Like the title says, this is my first drone. With that being said, I’m sure I have a lot to learn. I’ve owned it and flown it for about a week and maybe 6 flights. Seems like it has interference quite a bit. It likes to try and do level circles pretty often. And from my correspondence with the manufacturer that is/could be caused by interference. I live rural. So I’m not sure what type of interference is around where I’m flying it. Either way, when it flys correctly, it’s fun. Smooth controls as far as I’m concerned, just takes time to get used to them. I’ve crashed it a few times. Already destroyed a set of blades. But that’s to be expected I guess. Battery times are fairly close to what it says for me. Haven’t physically timed it. I’m sure I will in time. Right now I’m just doing spurts of flying trying to get it all figured out. I haven’t yet got into all the “extra” features yet either. I.e. track mode, waypoint mode, etc.. I have nothing to compare this to as far as another drone. However, what I’ve seen out of this one when I’m not crashing it, it is a good drone for the money I spent. Does a lot. And is exactly what it is designed to do… FLY. Videos and pictures from it are decent. I am still needing to use the SD card for this as I have read it does a little better quality using it. Initial review so far is good! I will be doing more reviews in time. Including videos/pics from SD card and from the app. Not sure when but I will. So stay tuned and see how it goes. Or just buy it and figure it all out on your own. I’m not writing this to act like an expert. Quite the opposite actually. I’m just a normal guy that knows nothing about drones and wanted one.

1781,5.0,This drone is AMAZING!!,"[[VIDEOID:59177621955a767a022a36ff080de1dd]] This is only my second drone, but I've flown both of them quite a bit, plus done a TON of research, watched videos, talked to people who own drones, etc.  My first drone was $100 model with a fixed camera and about a 10-minute runtime per battery and a 1080p camera.<br /><br />The first thing I want to say about this little beauty is WOW!  Seriously.  I mean the fact that it folds, fist nicely and compact into it's included carrying case and comes with two batteries is nice, but...none of those are the reasons that you buy a drone.  You want stability, ease of use, long flight times and quality pics/vids.  Well, this little drone has all of that.<br /><br />Camera - The resolution of the photographs is pretty awesome, in my opinion.  The video is high-quality, as well.  Check out my uploads.  Also, I love the fact that the camera tilts a full 90-degrees.  Cheaper drones have fixed cameras or only tilt 70-degrees, which is ok, but I prefer to position the camera to make the shot, not the drone to make the shot.  Plus, with fixed cameras, the position of the camera tends to make the pictures/videos dark because of the compensation for the sun being almost directly into the lens.  The fact that the camera doesn't have pan capability is no big deal, because when you have the controls in ""slow"" mode, the side-to-side and rotation motions are quite smooth.  The only ""con"" that I can come up with is the 120-degree lens.  Because it's somewhat panoramic, it tends to give pics/vids a bit of a fish eye effect.  Not so much that it's annoying, but it exists.<br /><br />Battery life - Runtimes are between 23-28 minutes, with mine, anyway.  Drone runtimes can vary even within the same model, so yours may get a couple more minutes or a couple less.  Either way, it's long enough to get a ton of enjoyment out of and when the battery dies; you let the motors cool off for about ten minutes and send it up with the second battery (included with my purchase).<br /><br />Controls - It has three speed positions (slow, normal, fast).  It defaults to normal when you turn it on, which is great for general flying.  Switch it to slow for smooth-scrolling video panning.  Go to fast when you want to get there in a hurry.  It has First Person View capability through your smartphone, with 5g WiFi, which is great.  The connection is solid and you get very little video stutter (unless you're panning really fast, which is bad practice anyway).  I like being able to see what the camera sees, when it sees it.  The app for your phone defaults to ""beginner mode"" until you turn it off.  Beginner mode only lets fly about 30m up and about that far away.  It's great when you're first starting out, but you'll probably want to switch to the highest limits by the end of the first battery (It's that easy to fly, even for beginners).<br /><br />Stability - This is where this baby shines!!  It is ROCK SOLID in the air.  I've had it up to it's 120m altitude limit (governed by the firmware) in moderate wind, and the only way you'd notice that it's windy is with a good gust.  The GPS super stable and when you let go of the control sticks in video mode, you'd swear you were taking still shots.<br /><br />I can't even begin to say enough good stuff about this little drone.  Don't let the price and the size of it fool you.  It's well constructed, rock-solid stable in the air, easy to fly, has long runtimes, and a fantastic tilting camera.  Sure, you can pay $1800+ for a Mavic Pro 2 or a Phantom, but unless you're a professional drone videographer, you're not going to see a remarkable difference enough to shell out that kind of dough.  On the other end of the spectrum, I don't recommend getting a cheaper drone first.  Which is what I did.  Even though this drone has more features and is more expensive than starter drones, the fact that it's so easy to fly will make you wish that you had gotten it first.  You're going to buy it eventually anyway, so why not make it your next ( or first).  And for around $300 (what I paid at the time), you can't go wrong.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-rEZctn0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-rEZctn0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-rEZctn0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XFCzMr6fL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XFCzMr6fL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XFCzMr6fL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ijU+2+PTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ijU+2+PTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ijU+2+PTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ikLMziQvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ikLMziQvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ikLMziQvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lkirUUm5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lkirUUm5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lkirUUm5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wbtMq2ZPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wbtMq2ZPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wbtMq2ZPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zP7cVOHvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zP7cVOHvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zP7cVOHvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AF6ANKN3UXQRLKOFKAIJFKQPQILQ,1597437443239,10,True

A low cost drone, not really expensive but with great features and easy to use. I found this one, Ruko F11. I was reading a little bit and watching some videos about this particular one. So I decided to buy one of these because of the reviews, the features and most importantly to me the flight time duration, because this one will last 30 minutes plus inside of the package includes an additional battery. With that the flight time can be doubled. That's amazing!. Well, I bought one and was excited with the purchase. Unfortunately, I received an used one which probably was a misunderstanding and a mistake of the warehouse. It Was a bad experience for me and I ended up retuning the product. What I want to point here is the excellent customer service that Ruko has available for the costumers. Since then, the costumer service representative has been in contact with me and maintaining a good communication with no hesitation. Anjie came with a great solution offering a new 🆕 set of drone directly from the company. I have decided to give another chance to this because it seems to be a nice product and you are not alone if there's an issue and if you need help they are 100% available to help you success in using this amazing set of drone. This is fantastic because others companies are not able to came up with a solution, but this one is way beyond the best product.

Long story short, we took the drone fully charged with our kids to the park. It is a large open field and we flew it around using the first battery up. When we insert the second battery onto the drone we raised it up into the air and all hell broke loose. The Drone literally became what I would call possessed. It started flying in circles and nothing we did on the controller would get it down. We lost all control. The drone after flying in circles shot up and off. My son ran as fast as he could but it was gone, we searched for days and even put an add online for a reward if found. I am so disappointed that we only got to use it a handful of times and that it appears something in the second battery took over once inserted on drone.

However, the price point of this drone, I should have gotten a much better product. When I was handed the box something already felt off about it, it was too light. Then as I open it I pulled the drone out and the material was just so very cheap feeling, I was worried that unfolding the propeller arms might damage it. I did however set it up and as far as ease it was very easy, but the noise that came from this drone while the props are not spinning worried me greatly, I did, however, give it a test flight, the drone couldn't stay stable I flew it up and it was all over the place, I flew it a higher and the connection between my phone and camera feed from the drone was lost, lowered it back down and it reconnected,(it was not very high at all). Then to top off this test flight the camera got stuck in the air so at the point I decide it was best to return this drone. Not sure why the other reviews was so great about this product maybe the got a different drone. Don't be fooled by the other reviews this drone is not the one for you.

1856,5.0,The Sub-$300 Price Tag Simply Cannot be Beaten,"The Ruko F11 Pro Drone is, to say the least, impressive. The F11 boasts a host of features, including a compact, foldable design, a sturdy, muscular body that feels comfortable and ""rich"" in one's hands, an integrated GPS module, 3 advanced flight modes, including Follow Me and Orbit, a Return to Home function, and an adjustable Ultra-High Definition (UHD) 4K camera that compels attention.<br /><br />The drone is easy to operate and maneuver, even for the neophyte pilot. Takeoff and landing are a breeze and the F11 Pro even has the ability to hover independently, allowing the pilot to either contemplate his next move, familiarize himself with the controls, or simply admire the power and beauty of the craft. The drone ships with two 2500mAh batteries, allowing a more-than-adequate 60 minutes combined flight time. Additionally, the pilot is also kept abreast of the battery status of both the drone and the transmitter via the downloadable SJ GPS PRO app. The app also provides all the in-flight details of the drone in addition to a quick start guide, troubleshooting notes, GPS, photo, video, and other controls.<br /><br />Videos are recorded in sharp, crisp, and clear 2.9K while photographs are captured at a vivid 4K. The GPS module and the transmitter both provide controls that may be used to adjust the camera remotely. The 120-degree field of view, especially when coupled with the in-built Orbit Mode, can be combined to produce compelling video footage. The Ruko F11 Pro can also record live video with its 5GHz First-person View (FPV) capabilities at up to 500M (1640 ft.). For the cinematographer on a budget, or for those just getting into drone videography, the sub-$300 price tag simply cannot be beaten.<br /><br />NOTE: To truly appreciate some of these features, the SJ GPS PRO app is essential. Consumers should also keep in mind that a dual-band (2.4-5G) smartphone is required. That being said, neither the app nor GPS is necessary for flight, photo, or video recording. GPS,  for example, is needed in case the drone gets out of the pilot's line-of-sight. The pilot can use the built-in Return to Home feature to locate and return the craft to its takeoff origin. That being said, another excellent feature is its Headless Mode which orients the drone to the pilot's location thus avoiding it getting lost.  GPS is also needed for WayPoint mapping. Moreover, for legal operation in the USA, the Ruko F11 drone needs to be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) due to its weight of 520G (18.3 oz.).<br /><br />In closing, the Ruko F11 Pro Drone is great for the beginner, expert, or professional. It is durable with a muscular, albeit non-bulky body of 17.5 in. x 15.9 in. x 3.2 in. with an open frame. And a 7 in. x 4 in. x 3.2 in. folded frame. It is quick, has a 2.4 GHz frequency transmitter with a maximum range of 1219M (3999 ft.), and can climb to heights of 120 m (393 ft.). The whisper-quiet brushless motors are powerful and maintain a cool temperature even after extended flight duration. The drone is delivered in a handsome carrying case, comes with extra blades, screws, and a small hex wrench for blade replacement, should that time come.<br /><br />Are there any drawbacks? The only two disbenefits that I can proffer at the time of this writing are the lack of a gimbal stabilizer and the inevitable barrel distortion due to the camera's ultra-wide-angle lens. While there is no getting around the issue with the lack of gimbal stabilizer—necessary to maintain a level in-flight camera—the barrel effect is a small expense; one that can easily be corrected in post-production with the image editing software of one's choice.<br /><br />If you are considering getting into drone piloting, aerial photography, or videography, the Ruko F11 Pro Drone is a great starting point. It provides the perfect combination of cost-effectiveness, ease-of-use, and quality that more than warrants the decision to purchase.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AF67R7C2X654FV6B6JUXIFJFKBOQ,1586202196343,43,True

1875,5.0,Fun to fly little drone,"Got the Ruko F-11 Pro Drone a while ago and had to wait for cold weather to clear and high winds to cease. Finally got to go out and run the F-11 through a couple of batteries and was pleasantly surprised on how well the quad-copter flew. The battery provides long flight time more than your typical drone.  This quad is very quick to set up and the provided check list makes it quick to get up and flying. The aircraft easily lifts off and holds position in one spot. Connection to a cell phone is good and shows camera image and a wide range of control settings and information.  There is a beginner mode that limits distance and control speed. The beginner mode is nice to test things out without too much excitement. It there is a wind, letting off the controls stops the drone in a couple of feet, but under control, the wind will carry you away if you don't get on the controls.  After you realize the GPS disables with control, you get the idea. Even at that, in a panic, release the control levers and the GPS takes over stopping the drone in a stable, one place, hover.  There is a thumb wheel that lets you set other more advanced control at will and puts the drone into a quicker and more nimble control bringing out the true fun of the machine. Even in respectable wind, the drone is stable and easy to control. The phone app has a lot of settings and interesting settings like follow mode and orbit to play with. You will not quickly get bored with this quad.  The camera produces decent images and video and the single axis camera gimble lets you get forward or straight down pictures with the turn of a second thumb wheel. The drone looks fascinating suspended in space while flying.  All in all a slightly more advanced aircraft at a fairly reasonable price.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGJUSIMWA7TOCUZG7JKQFMCWHMTA,1617587831402,1,True

The drone literally flys itself anytime  you release the sticks on the controller. The app was very user friendly and from unboxing to flying was less than 10 minutes. I have about 10 flights so far and everything has been perfect. Pictures are crisp and video quality is good. There is no camera gimbal so there is a little jello effect if the winds are high or you have maxed out the altitude but at reasonable height and distant from the focal point the quality exceeded my expectations for this price point.

1944,5.0,What a great purchase! This drone is awesome!,"This drone is awesome! Flying it is pretty simple once you get the hang of it, and the beginner mode allows for you to take it easy and not get too far away. The come home button is an awesome feature to have too, and the picture/video quality from the camera is excellent. This is absolutely worth every penny! I am so happy with this and can not wait to get it out further and further to see everything around us and what our property looks like from the air.<br />I did a lot of research on drones but I kept coming back to this one. It has everything I was looking for; foldable, POI, way point flight, return to hone, object tracking, 30 min flight time, 4K and a hell of a lot more. I read some neg reviews about the app, but it works perfect for me (galaxy s9+). Incredibly easy to fly. In fact you just tell it what to do and it does it. The drones that cost about $1000 more do have a few features that this one lacking. Like obstacle avoidance. But honestly, this is so easy to fly, I don't know why you would need it. Anyway, do yourself a favor, get the F11 Pro. At this price, I don't think anything else comes close.<br /> This drone can fly by itself, mostly. Take off and lands by a touch of a button. Comes home and lands with a touch of a button. If you panic during flight just let go of the controls and it just hovers waiting for you to resume control. The camera is great also. Gives a bird's eye view of your surroundings or first person pilot mode. You can clearly see and make out objects from 250 feet + high. We are glad we waited about a year before buying our first drone. This was mainly due to short flying times unless you sent close to $1000 or more. What's the point if you can only fly 15 minutes at a time. By the time you get used to the drone, times up, dead battery. This one goes for 25+ minutes and comes with 2 batteries. It flies high enough, fast enough, long enough with great views so you can actually enjoy the thing. I highly recommend this product!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4177JRYVJ5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4177JRYVJ5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4177JRYVJ5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pg5MyWb1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pg5MyWb1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pg5MyWb1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-jdIahdDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-jdIahdDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-jdIahdDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614Ib4JJfBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614Ib4JJfBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/614Ib4JJfBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813pkeN8moL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813pkeN8moL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813pkeN8moL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEHMZ6KK3HNTANNMXLJHNK6ECV2Q,1608923547655,1,True

It hovers really well and stays in placed. I even got it to circle a point unintended, although I knew it had the capability. The control is tight and smooth, witch is the most important thing for me.  I am uncertain about the video quality because I have not tried it. All in all, I will give it a 5 on the things first experience.<br /><br />Update to the video quality: I recorded on a very ugly windy, overcast, foggy day in Dallas, and it came out pretty good given the conditions.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHAINMZ4XLQAFISWFOSXDNU5NN2A,1574656307499,0,True

Today was really windy, but I wanted to try it out anyways. It's large enough and heavy enough that it withstood the gusts and maintained good responsive control regardless.

The blades are the only part that appears to potentially part to break in the future and Roku provided a spare complete set!  Within 10 minutes of opening the packaging I had the drone in the air.  It is set on beginning mode which limits the speed, altitude and distance it can travel.  Probably a good thing for most beginners.  It can easily be adjusted in the future via you smart phone.  The basic functions work really well and when the weather gets a little better I will try some of the more advanced functions. I did by accident remove the GPS during my first flight and the drone took off by itself.  I was able to get it under control and bring it back but be careful not to start  hitting unknown buttons while learning to fly.  The quality of the pictures and video were very good.

2014,4.0,Excellent Drone for Beginners,"Received the drone on a Saturday, practiced a couple of hours in the afternoon and by the next day had pretty well mastered.  If you are looking for a drone that is nice for both beginners or even intermediate flyers, this is the drone for you.  It includes many features such as, RTH, Headless mode, Follow me and some features such as hand gestures I doubt I will ever use but it's there if you want.  The camera takes excellent videos and photos for a drone in this price range due to its 2K camera.  And it's works great and in tandem with a mobile phone app that is available so you can actually have a live view of what the drones camera is seeing.<br /><br />On the one I received, I cannot get the controller to turn off.  Instructions say to hold down power button for 1 second to turn on and 2 seconds to turn off.  When on, I can hold down the power button for 15-20 seconds and the controller will never go off.  Not a deal killer because I usually charge the controller once I'm finished flying but I do wish it worked correctly.<br /><br />Be advised there is one feature that much more expensive drones employ is there is no object avoidance so always be aware of where to drone is.  All in all, a great purchase for a first time drone flyer without spending an arm and a leg and much better than the little toy drones.<br /><br />Update: Contacted the seller about the controller not turning off.  Response with quick and very helpful.  To turn off press the power button once and then hold down a second time.  Instructions were not clear on that but they actually sent a video of how to turn off.  Later in the day the drone flew off at a high rate of speed and I had no control.  It slammed into the side of a house and one of the arms broke off.

Camera quality seems good.  I suggest reading the instructions completely and thoroughly prior to flying, also get familiar with the remote.

I've emailed the manufacturer but fully expect I will be told I am out of luck since it's been well past 90 days. (Edit, my son just said that it had issues recording to the SD card from the beginning but he thought he was doing something wrong because sometimes it would work and other times it wouldn't.

2102,5.0,Great drone and customer service!,I’ve had a few drones from the cheap $15 ones to a $200 ones. This drone is by far one of the best ones I’ve owned so far for its cost. It also comes with a nice carrying case. It also flies better than some of the more expensive ones I’ve flown. Like any controlled aircraft if it’s windy it is hard to control so I must confess I have been blown into a tree or two but when I went to pick it up there was no damage only to the propellers. It still flies too so the quality of the product is great as well. So if you are a beginner and you fly into things you can rest assured that this drone won’t break easily. There is actually a beginner mode that is on when you first fly that you can keep on or turn off. If you do break the propeller it comes with extras so you can just change it out and keep on flying. Now for the customer service part. When I received my drone the landing legs were broken so I sent a message to them and they replaced them at no charge! The response time is fast and they seem ready and willing to help with any issues that may arise. The only thing I don’t like which isn’t a big deal because you can just click it away and there’s probably a setting to turn it off but before you fly on the app it makes you watch the videos every time even if you press skip other than that it’s a really great product! I’ll probably buy one of the more expensive ones later on to test the difference!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rYMvseiUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rYMvseiUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rYMvseiUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WTBpXWEjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WTBpXWEjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WTBpXWEjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81p3TmubdRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81p3TmubdRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81p3TmubdRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AGIX5SQPPNYWGDXEP2Y6KZTDYBCQ,1679236879990,6,True

2114,2.0,Maddening setup; Android app does not work; Company paying buyers for positive reviews,"First of all, beware any positive reviews. The drone comes with a card indicating they'll send you a free battery in exchange for a positive review.<br /><br />I found this drone exasperating. In 2020, I would expect that the thing ""just works."" Not so here. I unpacked the device, and went through the instructions. Before you fly, there are several steps you need to go through - I wasn't aware this is common in low end drones, so that was a surprise but a trade-off I could live with. You should expect about 10 minutes of jockeying with the thing to get it calibrated, if all goes well (which it won't).<br /><br />The first step is to connect the drone to the remote control by moving the joysticks in a certain way. It took several cycles of turning the remote and drone on/off to get it to connect - I almost gave up and returned the device as defective. The other calibration steps are easier, but be prepared to do each step multiple times to get it to ""take.""<br /><br />I spent about 90 minutes over two attempts to get the device ready to fly with the remote only. I tried to connect the app at several times throughout the process. My phone connected to the drone's wifi just fine. I downloaded the app from the QR code in the manual, but this exact model was not available in the selection menu. The app would not connect to the drone at any point in the process. I have a Pixel 5 running stock Android 11.<br /><br />So I am beyond frustrated - I sunk a lot of time into this, but I'm not willing to go through a tear-your-hair-out process every time I get it out. It clearly does not work with Android; the calibration steps (about 8 steps) take multiple attempts to work at each step; and the positive reviews here are incentivized. I feel taken for a ride.<br /><br />Finally, this device is also clearly intended for the Chinese market and poorly transferred to the US. The manual has spelling errors, and the Android app has links that direct you to videos in Chinese. Support is only available during overnight hours (after 9pm EST) - I'm not opposed to support staff being based overseas, particularly at this price point - but they really should be available during daylight hours in their target market.<br /><br />I left one star because I think on paper this is a great device. Specs are great for the price, and included 2nd battery and spare rotors is nice.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AETTIWHZUURU5LTP4JQRTGKOS3ZQ,1611072245094,2,True

Lucky for me, he was flying a Ruko F11, so I ordered the same one and it arrived two days later.  Me and the boys have been flying it non-stop ever since.  We love it.<br /><br />Take some time to review the instructions and watch some of the videos prior to flight.  After that, keep the handy Quick Start Guide with you during the first couple flights.  That brief 'training' was all I needed.  The drone was very stable and worked perfect.  Having GPS capabilities has been very helpful getting the drone to return to the exact take off location with a push of the button.

2141,5.0,Freakin awesome 👍,"This is the first drone I’ve ever bought or flown. Got it delivered yesterday a day earlier than estimated. This drone is very easy to fly. It has a beginner mode that limits its capabilities until you get the hang of it which eased my nervousness a little. When you turn it off this thing really moves and goes very high. I’ve cracked it up 4 times so far 3 in trees and once it slammed into the side of my home. It’s very strong and durable because I thought I broke it but it started right back up again and it was like nothing happened. The camera on it is way better than I even expected it to be. Very clear picture and shoots great videos as well. It came with 2 batteries that gave me almost a full hour of feeling like a little kid again. I’m super happy I took the time and researched a lot before I got this one. I highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a drone and and can’t decide what one to buy.

2145,5.0,The Ruko F11 is Fantastic,I'm a beginner who researched Drone features and company models for a long time before deciding on the Ruko F11.  It came down to what use I really intended the drone for. I wanted a Drone that would be easy to fly with the safety measure of headless mode in case my abilities were hopeless. I wanted affordability because If I was to crash and destroy my big boy toy it would be hard to shake my head and laugh if I paid 900.00 dollars. Replacement part availability was also a concern. Photo and video are a bonus because the fun is in the flying and maneuvers. The Ruko F11 Pro has been great. Setup is easy to learn and repeat. Flight time over 20 minutes. After only a few flights I was off beginner mode and flying with headless mode turned off. Before long I had the confidence to fly beyond Wifi range and trust the return home button. The F11 has always impressed. The bonus is the photos and videos are amazing. The look from above is incredible. Have contacted customer service several times on questions that I had and they were helpful and fast to reply.  Have been able to go beyond 500 meters and still have phone wifi connections usually. This is surprising at the price of this drone.  Needless to say I would recommend this model and would buy again without hesitation.

2151,5.0,"Great pictures, videos, and fun to fly!","My first drone was a Contixo brand.  I returned it to Amazon because it arrived with one DOA battery and on the 2nd and 3rd flights it just went haywire.<br /><br />I did a little more research and being my first “adult” priced drone $300 was the limit.  I saw this on a limited time deal and with some quick research I ordered it.<br /><br />It’s been rock solid, after 22 loges flights even!  We are building a house and it’s been so fun to take aerial views with it.  We have used it at the lake and done follow me with in the boat. I am looking forward to using it on a camping trip this coming weekend.<br /><br />I have tested a lot of features on this drone and they work.  The return to home RTH works when you turn the transmitter off and when the battery gets too low.  It usually lands within about 1 foot of the original departure point.<br /><br />The photos have really good quality in good lighting.  They get a little grainy in the lower light.  If you happen to point it towards the sun or the lighted horizon it will over expose the camera and the land will be silhouetted.  However just point the camera down and you can find a nice balance on the exposure.<br /><br />The videos on calm days are really good.  You have to be slow and smooth on the remote though.  For example, slowly accelerate forward and it looks professional.  If you let off to fast the drone with almost fly backwards to stop at that point throwing your camera upwards, so slowly decelerate and you will have nice videos.<br /><br />Videos on windy days are jumpy.  The camera is not on a gimbal to stabilize it.  However if it’s not too windy you can use apps like iMovie and Windows Movie Maker, both free, to digitally stabilize the videos.  It may crop some of the video and you will still see bumps as the wind rocks the drone, but it does a pretty decent job.<br /><br />In the wind this drone is pretty amazing.  You trade some battery life but around here the wind is usually 7-10 mph and this does quite well in that.  Some days gusting to 15-20 and the drone handles them pretty well.<br /><br />It is a lot of fun to fly.<br /><br />Some cons though, when you get out to 150-200 meters away (their on screen app is all in meters) the video can get a little jumpy.  It could be my iPhone 7  or the drone but at that distance you can barely see the drone anyway.  The video on the SD card in the drone is smooth.<br /><br />A couple pointers that aren’t real clear in the manual.<br /><br />On a return to home, the drone will fly up to the altitude set in the app and return home.  Make sure that’s above all your terrain, especially important working in valleys as this drone doesn’t have obstacle detection.<br /><br />Second, when you have the drone circle around a point of interest fly the drone right over the point of interest, hit the video and photo buttons at the same time, then back the drone away to the radius distance away from the center you want and then hit the two buttons again and it will fly the circle around your point.<br /><br />All in all, if you are getting a drone for fun and pretty cool pictures this drone fits the bill.  I feel fairly safe flying it and am starting to trust it.  My kids even fly it.<br /><br />If you really want smooth videos look for a drone with a gimbal mount camera.<br /><br />There are mods you can make to this drone but I’m sure they void the warranty.  There are different lenses you can install and antenna upgrades, etc.  I have seen them done online but I have not done them.  I’m just putting this out there If you like to tinker around.<br /><br />I will and would recommend this drone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710M9ZaeOjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710M9ZaeOjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710M9ZaeOjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Msmqi5tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Msmqi5tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Msmqi5tL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LovSjy6qL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LovSjy6qL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LovSjy6qL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEIXACHCHE36ZXIUZI4U4BLQT3FA,1597124762976,3,True

2178,5.0,"A pleasure to fly, very well built.","I've owned many remotes in the past. Helicopters,  8 and 4 prop drones. All seemed cheap and unimpressive. More like toys, and not very useful. I was hesitant to purchase this one. I am VERY glad that I did. The ROKU F11 Pro came in a well padded and thought out zippered case. Similar to a camera case. Inside, the drone, extra battery, extra props and the drones remote were all nestled safely. When removing the drone from its case, it was immediately noticeable that this was constructed of quality materials and made to last. The battery is easy to install and remove and is incorporated into the drones overall design. The arms fold neatly along the sides of the body, and the props fold out of the way. This design would allow a person to carry this drone in a large pocket if necessary,  although I would suggest using its original case and perhaps a small backpack.<br />  The set up of the drone is straight forward. With concise and clear instructions. After checking the battery levels in both the drone and its remote, I had the drone flying in about 2 minutes.<br />  Speaking of controls, when the remote is folded out into ""Flight mode"" and my phone was placed in its holder, the remote felt as familiar as any PS4 or XBox controller. With the Left joystick you control  Ascent and descent, and the direction that the drone is facing, while the Right joystick controls the forward and backward travel as well as the left and right drift.<br />From beginners to more advanced pilots, this drone will not disappoint.  It has a very small learning curve. I took it through all of its capabilities,  such as Follow Me, and laying out a course for it to follow. It performed perfectly.<br />  If you are thinking of getting an inexpensive drone, and want one that has many of the features of much higher priced drones, then you should consider buying the ROKU F11 Pro.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wNfRbaO7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wNfRbaO7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wNfRbaO7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AE2XYRPOLVBUKD6ON3YKF6C5H35Q,1603128319636,0,True

2192,5.0,Drone-tastic,"I recently purchased the Ruko F11 Pro Drone and I must say, it's an amazing product with exceptional customer service. I was a first-time drone user, and the guidebook and videos provided by Ruko made it incredibly simple and easy for me to learn how to fly the drone. The drone had outstanding wind resistance, and the homing beacon was spot on, which made it easier to return it to its original spot. The packaging is perfect for traveling with the drone, and the quality of the pictures and videos that I captured is impressive.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after just a few runs in my backyard, my drone's wings caught a palm frond, and it crashed. As I checked the product box for any warranty information, I found out that I was outside the 90 days free warranty period. I was concerned about the repair costs and contacted Ruko product support to explain my situation. To my surprise, I received a response from a rep named Hailey within 24 hours, who offered me her expertise and a solution.<br /><br />I was impressed with Hailey's knowledge of the product and her willingness to help me. Ruko's Customer Service team was amazing and patiently listened to my concerns and provided me with several options to repair my drone.  I am grateful for Ruko team's outstanding customer service and the support that Ruko provided.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Ruko F11 Pro Drone to anyone who is interested in capturing amazing pictures and videos.

Looking at the assembly does not look like it can be replaced.  Quickest $299 I spent.  I am sure this is probably a good product for intermediate and advanced flyers but definitely not a beginner.

Get some hours in and then move up to a Ferrari Version.  This is a Top of the Line Camry version in my eyes.  TRD package and all.<br /><br />Pros- 20kt winds were handled very well.  Drone does really well at staying in a 1m circle at that wind speed.<br />-cheap repair parts<br />-I have personally crashed ten times now without GPS Mode ON of course, replacing only blade tips so far.  (Plenty of cheap blades out there)<br />-took a 20ft fall, I reset gyro and compass via the instructions and it's like it never fell. Minus obvious plastic scuffing(2nd picture above)<br /><br />Cons-  at this price point I only found the gps follow me feature doesn't work in the app.  Might be user error.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g3e29779L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g3e29779L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g3e29779L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+7+dJNX5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+7+dJNX5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+7+dJNX5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oJJElEAwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oJJElEAwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oJJElEAwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811-4rNvGCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811-4rNvGCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811-4rNvGCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHFEFUHJ46Z43LZYLLYOK5EN6UJA,1688925115890,0,True

I troubleshoot the remote, it works fine for 10 minutes and then it shuts off randomly and the drone decides to not slowly return to home, but instead turn off and fall from 165 feet. This caused the camera housing to come out. The battery did not have an issue it said it lost connection to the remote. I wish I could return it but unfortunately I doubt I can.

2231,1.0,Aircraft does its own thing,"I’ve had this drone for about a week. I have about eight hours of flight time with it. About 50% of the time it works great. Here are some of the issues when it’s not working.<br /><br />1) sometimes the camera works, sometimes it doesn’t. You usually have to close the app and restart it several times before the camera will work.<br /><br />2) sometimes in midflight the photo from the camera displayed on the phone will freeze. This is not from being too far away or from losing cell phone reception or from having an outdated, smart phone.<br /><br />3) when you first receive the drone it’s in “beginner flight mode” basically what that does is while in flight the plane hits an invisible wall and bounces back to you. That invisible wall is only about 90 feet away. It’s gonna cause problems, because when it tries to zoom back to you, it might run into something as it’s flying in reverse as fast as it can to wherever you are.<br /><br />4) this is the worst one of all. It has done this three times to me now. In mid flight for no reason it will literally do its own thing. It will start flying in circles or go from left to right, front to back, up and down. When doing this, it has ran directly into a tree and also decided to take it sell for a direct nose dive into the ground from about 60 feet up.<br /><br />I’ll be returning this as soon as possible.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AFRTQ4E2BHNEOVHQXLHJSHPTVMPA,1686613604437,3,True

However, I am having problems.<br /><br />All I wanted to do is test it out by taking it off and landing it with the one button take off and landing feature. I did all the necessary pre flight preparation. I had 3 bars of gps and was outside on flat surface. I push the takeoff button hoping it would lift to about 5 feet and hover. I tried this about 10 times and each time it sporadically veered hard to the right or to the left and did not hover at all, trying to land it pushing the same button does not work, it goes down but doesn’t land, sometimes touching the ground and lifting back up. Each of these times I tried I went through the flight prep again before trying. It crashed every time, I have already had to replace all the blades with the extra blades that were sent with it.<br /><br />I have emailed the company for help and still waiting on a reply.

My first drone has a fixed camera, so I purchased this for the movable camera.<br />The few times I have had the opportunity to fly this drone I have enjoyed it a great deal. From a beginner’s perspective this is a good drone to learn with. The 30 min flight time allows sufficient time to try out the drone’s various features. The other drone I fly has a 12 min flight time which barely gives a newbie time to read the instructions.<br />I did notice that Ruko states, ""The camera doesn't adjust fully forward——This Camera unique design prevents the blades from affecting the picture or video so it will not look 100% forward. At the same time, this will give you a better view of the flight, My F11pro will look 100% forward showing the blades in the top left and right corners.

I was flying far enough from obstacles, I thought.  The third and final time I took it out, I used auto take off, and it did not stop where it was supposed to.  It kept going upward.  I was using the joystick to try and make it come back down, but it was not working.  It got up about 100', then just hovered.  I could not get it to go in any direction.  I was hitting the landing button, then using the joystick as well, in hopes that I could get it to come down.  Then, after a minute, it just descended.  Instead of hovering and landing softly, it did not slow down as much as it should have, causing a hard landing.  I read the remotes are an issue.  I'd steer clear.

2352,5.0,The Ruko F11 Drone is awesome!,"I've had the most amazing experience with the Ruko F11!  It isn't easy, it is not one of those turn it on and fly drones, the start up procedures need to be followed exactly.  This drone is very powerful and flies very well in a light wind and returns to exactly where it took off.  It has a full 30+ minutes of flight time.  The photos are spectacularly clear!  The video is amazing!<br />This drone is not for indoor use unless you have a vast area such as an arena, it is very powerful and creates wind that effects the flight when it nears furniture, for instance (ask me how I know).  I did crash it a couple times because I tried taking off too close to the house and the indoor flying incident.  It is durable and even though I chipped the props a little, it corrects itself and flies awesome.  I haven't used my extra props (included with the item) yet and I don't crash anymore.<br />I previously had light-weight drones and they get blown away by the slightest breeze.  This drone is substantial enough to fly in wind and as I said very powerful<br />It is not like the toy drones, it is complicated at start up because you link the WIFI with your Smartphone then procedures allow the gyros synchronize and the GPS to link with your phone.  Then it is so responsive and easy to control.  Honestly I was in too big of a hurry to follow the instructions and that resulted in the crashes.<br />After mastering the flying, then you learn to operate the HD camera.  It allow you to adjust the lens angle, zoom and take action video while you fly.<br />This is a good purchase, I'm cheap so I hesitated to purchase this, but I am really glad I bought it.  very worth the cost.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91fYplxRWfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91fYplxRWfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91fYplxRWfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHYYIWORAJYI5C5QL22VLEMRV3CQ,1611100869801,2,True

It comes right back and lands all by itself, right where it took off from. Really, the only negative I can think of is the videos don’t always work. Sometimes it doesn’t record when it says it is, and sometimes it does. There is no way to view the videos on the SIM card without removing it and plugging it into a PC and looking.

I typically learn to do things turning the power on and hitting the throttle.  This was no different.  Some advice...Read the adequate directions, be sure to do the set up calibration properly and when you do the gyro calibration BE SURE it's pretty level or it may fly toward a building and then when you try too recover it when it won't level out and it hits some powerlines and then you panic and kill the power and it falls 15 feet into a utility trailer, then the ground it will probably slightly break the landing gear and bang the props up.  It will most likely still fly after this but will be a little louder until you put some new props on it.  I have already placed the order.  Leave it on beginner settings so it won't get out of control until you get the hang of it.  Obviously the camera can take a hit as well and still work.

2419,4.0,Good first drone,"Had never had or flown a drone or RC aircraft so this was a bit of an experience for me initially. Using iPhone version of the SJRC app I initially had difficulty and it appeared that the remote might have been malfunctioning and not getting fully charged. After some very responsive troubleshooting with the company I was able to use their corrective method to get the controller to completely recognize battery status of drone and controller. For a first timer this thing is pretty cool and I have taken a few videos and still photos. I would say if you have never flown one of these things definitely leave the beginner configuration settings locked in and just practice practice practice, especially the landing if doing manual as the blades sit close to the ground and high grass will contact them. The app return to home feature and auto land are very decent functions, but I have not mastered the auto circle feature yet, nor have I tried the follow me feature. I only knocked it 1star because of the quirk with the app/controller interface reporting and the fact I could not get the rotate around an object feature to work correctly as of this review. It’s a decent value for the money so far with nine short flights (under 10min) under my belt.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nJXVtFOJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nJXVtFOJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nJXVtFOJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AHEB3XQZIBYSN7FW34YTFFYF46VQ,1577812116138,1,True

I practiced in a large open area and had no issues even on the first flights. Over the next couple of days I learned more and more and feel confident enough to take off in small clearings and with even continuous line-of-sight. All the described functions worked without a hitch and I took some great videos and photos over the local college. (No people or school during these pandemic times). With all the safeguards, I have no worries  of watching my drone take a unscheduled flight to never-never land and me ending up with a controller and nothing else.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drone to any level pilot, especially those beginners, like me, that want to be able to hang on to your investment.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AG42U36DIO6GBJXTYS7EYF4MUU4A,1587089663124,0,True

2442,5.0,Picked the right drone!,"I have never owned a drone. I spent weeks researching range, speed, frequencies, weight restrictions in places I want to go, camera types and more. It was not easy. I decided on folding drones for ease of carry and zoned in on a price I was comfortable with. After all this research I picked the Ruko F11 pro. And I couldn’t have been happier.<br /><br />First, it got here to me a week faster than expected. I am stationed in Japan so I was quite amazed.<br /><br />Second, I was concerned about my beginner skill to operate a drone. Most electronics you get a little card with operating web links on how to guides. But when I say my learning began on opening the box I wasn’t kidding. Inside the lid was a quick start guide. Opening the enclosed travel case was another guide. And then a full manual. Now this may not mean anything to most people. But knowing a company put that time into it made me a bit more confident.<br /><br />Third. It’s a beautiful piece of hardware. Light. Stylish. Easy to understand how to fold/unfold, change the battery, insert a memory card, etc.  the remote is comfortable in the hand and holds my iPhone 11 just fine.<br /><br />Fourth. It was tested before shipping. Everything arrived charged. I get that all the time of “tested” but this company really does test each one. That’s such a time saver for them, and an extra thumbs up from me.<br /><br />Fifth, the software on the phone is simple. But amazing. You don’t need a physics degree to understand it. At my age I don’t want to take a fundamental drone class, and with this one I don’t have to.<br /><br />And finally, it works beautifully!

2526,5.0,Amazing drone,"[[VIDEOID:e9132e1db94a75980d252dac12044144]] So, I have been flying, and crashing, drones for over a year. I started out with a little one from Harbour Freight.  After about two weeks, I watched it fly off out over the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, I’ve had a Vivitar Skyview, bird took it out. Really. A Vivitar Phoenix, a piece of junk. A Potensic Atom. Fun drone, bad a$$ range but dainty. One small semi hard landing and all the sensors quit. Then a Walkera T210 mini. Was so excited to get it. But about a hundred and fifty yards into my first flight this little drone took off. I never seen a drone move so quickly. It would not respond.  It hit the hard deck very very hard. Totaled it. The drone took about 1 1/2 hours to bind to remote to begin with. I guess what I’m trying to get to is this. I got this Ruko F11 Pro and right out of the box this thing was in the air in 10 minutes. Not counting the charge battery time of just about 4 hours for remote and two batteries. This drone is of professional level yet a beginner could fly it easily. I live on the Texas coast and the wind is pretty much always blowing. Oh yeah, did I mention the Holy Stone 360 or something like that. I could never fly it because of the wind. This Ruko drone has been up to 395ish feet in the air, over the Lavaca Bay, in winds in excess of 35 mph!!! Crazy? Nope. True? Yes. I believe that Ruko has outdone all othe drones in its price gap. Hands down. The range on it is true. Will be getting range extenders eventually. I like to take it as far as it’ll go. It’s also durable. I’ve landed kinda hard a few times because of the wind.

2540,5.0,The drone works really good!,"The drone is really funny, I got it by Wednesday and I didn't have the chance to try it till two days ago.<br />So the drone I think for the price which is 299.99$ is an awesome product, the brushless motors which is a great improvement that you see on dji drones and other ones close to that gap, the camera is clean, pictures 2k, videos in 1080p, the 90° angle of the camera and also the button for the speed of the drone simply makes the difference, they're so many features that in my opinion they're good but is stuff that I'm never gonna use, let's be clear boys, you want a drone that can take pictures and videos on high resolution and also be very fast, this little guy goes at almost 27 mph, the signal is good, and the controller is really comfortable, plus the two batteries that last 28 min each one and the case that goes within, makes you wanna go outside and try it on a field.<br />Now the bad thing about this is that the camera doesn't have the 3-axis, that means your videos are gonna be a bit shaky if is windy, the batteries take a little too much to charge at they're fullest (almost 5h if used all of it) The connection in the app sometimes gets lost, when is about this whole recording thing, sometimes I have him at H: height 43 or 44 (the limit is 120) and the transmission gets kinda bugged or slow or just lost the connection. To be honest there's nothing you can do to fix this, I have a Samsung s9 and this happen sometimes maybe is just with android I still have to try with my friend's phone (she haves an Iphone 8) to see how's gonna be the behavior.<br />Guys this is a cheap drone and it haves a lot of good things specially the motors, with the bad stuff I think in my opinion is just stuff that can get fixed, updates for the app, another battery, and just fly when is not windy, the drone itself works perfectly so if you're like me that I always saw drones copters and those kind of little guys on internet and always wanted to try for real, this is your choice, just read the instructions, be aware of what you're doing, flight safe and respect your surroundings.",[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AG66Z3IMZ2QLFXH5L6LBWPPHBKNA,1587228733481,0,True

2556,4.0,Bang for the buck even under non conventional use,Overall this has been a great investment and I would not hesitate to purchase another. For the average user this drone will perform well meeting or surpassing most people’s needs. I have had this drone for a week now. Overall it has been good with a few minor issues.<br /><br />First off before I get to deep into this my experience tends to be different than most. I work in the fixed wireless business or wireless internet service provider field so issues that I run into are different than your normal user.<br /><br />1. I have found that in high wireless noise areas the drone drops the wireless connection between itself and your phone/tablet. If you allow for the drone to settle for a minute or so it tends to find a clear channel and you can continue on with flying. I have had no issues with the drone losing connection to the controller in this situation and can continue to fly but I have to keep a visual on the drone (maybe this is something they can fix in the future so you can connect to the controller vs. the drone).<br /><br />2.The GPS is a bit off when you allow the drone to return to home with the feature on the controller. My drone tends to average about 20 foot from the original launch point when using this feature. However in an emergency this is fine. I have found that the drone is super simple to fly and completing take off and landings without the extra buttons is way easier to work with.<br /><br />3. The camera is great and performs surprisingly well. I do wish it was gimbal instead due to the fact that I use it for taking pictures of my broadcast equipment at elevated heights (150 to 300 foot) so wind can be a problem when trying to get Detailed stills or video. Patients is the key tho.<br /><br />4. Lastly is the case. It has been great for organization and I was able to store an extra battery inside with no issues (I can store 2 in the battery slot and I leave one in the drone). However I have found with slight pressure on the lid you can turn the drone on while it is in the bag. (It just powers up it does not try to operate you have to use the remote to make it functional) This does cause the battery to drain so if you are not careful you can loose some valuable flight time. A relocate of the power button would solve this issue.,[],B07VCD1SRL,B07VCD1SRL,AEWG2WSJTMPSCVMSLSBZMVJ3OTZA,1595684865183,1,True
