6,5.0,A HIT!,"I purchased this for my 3 year olds birthday party and it was a totally hit. It was much bigger than I expected and at one point we had 6 or 7 kids in it (closely supervised) and no one got trampled. The kids were ages 18 months to 8 years. I even went in it with my 18M old. I can't even imagine what the party would've been like had we not had the bouncy castle. It completely entertained the kids for 2.5 hours. I already have other parents wanting to rent this for their parties. You won't be disappointed. Sets up quickly, disassembles just as quick.

Im the dad 200lb+ and i can get in roll and crawl around and play  but If your looking to get in with the kids and &#34;JUMP&#34;,then definitely get the next size bigger.

12,5.0,One of our favorite purchases,"We purchased this bounce house for my 3 year old daughter and it's one of the best purchases we've made. We keep it inside, in our basement, so I can't speak to it's functionality outside, but we use this almost every day and we're very happy with it. It is big at 9x12, and keep in mind (especially if you plan to put this inside) the tube that connects the bounce house to the fan needs to be straight, so that adds about 4 feet of width to this. Since we do use this so often, I'm really happy with the quality, as we haven't had any issues. This keeps our daughter physical when it's too hot or cold to be outside. The weight limit is also 250 lbs, so I'll admit, I sometimes sneak in there and it's still holding air!  This is also super easy to set up - just connect the fan and it inflates quickly.  Take-down is also fast and easy.  Very highly recommended and very much enjoyed at our house.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AEFB7GQJUQWWIOK35NOMAC47PI6Q,1404220312000,1,False

22,3.0,"Fun, but Questionable Quality","Initially, I was extremely happy with this product. It was easy to set up and take down and my 2 boys (ages 2 and 4) loved it. After a couple weeks I noticed small holes along some of the stitches on the slide and where the slide connects to the rest of the bounce house. I contacted customer service and inquired about the holes, and the response was to return it and receive a replacement. Customer service did extremely well. UPS picked it up the next day and delivered a new one within 4 days. However, the second one I received was actually worse than the one I sent back. Little holes everywhere, and it did not come with enough patches to fix those holes. Sadly, I sent it back as well. My boys were not happy.<br />While we did have them, they were a lot of fun for my boys. Large enough for 2 to 3 kids at a time, but small enough to even fit inside our basement on colder or wetter days.<br />I am guessing that several of the reviews written on his product were done within the first month, which is why it has such great reviews. However, I am not sure that it will be worth it in the long run, depending on how fast those stitches tear. A lot of the holes in the bouncers that I received were along seams, so I doubt it would have been fixable in the future.<br />I do like this product and would recommend it, but for the amount of money paid, I would want a higher guarantee that it would be worth it in the long run, or at least a year long warranty to make sure I get my money's worth. The holes may be small and insignificant at the start, but they will only get larger as time goes on.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715Avti9SWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715Avti9SWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715Avti9SWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aQT1buiWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aQT1buiWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aQT1buiWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AHZO6WTDCJD5TS5WKWBYRPGDQGLQ,1476200464000,17,True

31,5.0,Quality is much better than expected,"Kids have been jumping in this thing nonstop for a week. Add a few balls and you've got an inflatable babysitter. It inflates in 20 seconds. Quality is much better than expected. The fan is very powerful. I have to pull kids out for mandatory water breaks. Its larger than you would think by the photos.<br /><br />Update: It supports  an adults weight, but the stitching has started to come loose after I've plopped down a few times (6' - 180 lb male). Though it now leaks air, its not a huge deal because the fan is still keeping up with the pace. A patch kit in included, but I dont think its necessary.<br /><br />It gets dirty easily, so I recomment buying a 16'x25' tarp and using steaks for outdoor use. Its a pain to clean, so dont let the kids in/out with muddy feet.<br /><br />All in all, the kids have begged for me me to set this up once a week.. for the last 8 months.

40,5.0,Great investment if you have small children,"If you have small children, this is a GREAT investment.  It does say 250 lbs max, and adults can't bounce in it (obviously, per the ratings).  I am near 250 lb, and I can lay in it, sit in it, etc., no problem.  Can I bounce in it (yes, I tried)? Marginally.  I tried once because my three year old wanted me to go in.  I did stand, and I did bounce, but I could hear the air going the wrong way out the blower (!) :)<br /><br />But that's not a strike against it, the instructions tell the rating, its not meant for me, so be it.  It is great for a party where you could have one to say, eight little kids playing in it.  The slide is a nice touch.<br /><br />The blower is around 400W, and the cord is really long (and GFCI protected), so its really convenient.  Even if you needed an extension cord, its not a high enough draw that you'd need a really heavy 10Ga cord (unless you had one handy anyway).<br /><br />It packs, stows, and operates well.  The blower isn't too loud, its just a great piece.  Do use the tent stakes as it will slide on grass.

48,2.0,Didn't last,"Santa brought this to my 1 and 3 year old for Christmas in 2016. We used it in our basement nearly every single time (took it outside twice)  and no children older than 5 ever used it. We took very good care of it and used it carefully but today (August 2017, 8 months after 1st use) we discovered a large ripped seam on the side of the slide. The patch kit won't work on the nylon seam and the warranty from little tikes is only 90 days from date of purchase on fabric. That's pathetic. They must be counting on the fact that these things are flimsy and will rip apart quickly. I'm going to try to sew it but I doubt it will hold.

94,1.0,DANGEROUS MOLD AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.,"Worst customer service I have ever encountered. We had this bounce house for less than a year when I started a severe mold infestation. We always kept it inside. We cleaned and dried it thoroughly after each use and did EVERYTHING to protect the integrity of it. My son loved this bounce house but after about 6 months of it continuing to grow DANGEROUS black mold that we were unable to remove (after EVERY attempt we were instructed) we had to finally dispose of it as it had become a serious health threat.<br />We contacted little tikes several times to try to remedy the situation with no response other than “mold is not our problem. It’s a fabric and environmental problem”, they couldn’t even try to give us a discounted price on trying to replace it.<br />At this point we are almost $300 down the drain and left with a toddler who is devastated without his bounce house. I even asked if maybe we could but just the unit without the inflater as that is still working, again, with no helpful response.<br />I will now go out of my way to purchase a new bounce house for our son with ANY company besides little tikes. Any company that cares so little about their customers has forever lost a customer in me and my family.<br />Shame on little tikes having such disregard for families who purchase things from them. Especially in this unique quarantine time of need when families are struggling both financially and emotionally. As a pediatric provider I will be certain to NEVER recommend their products.<br />So disappointed in their lack of regard for families. I wish I would have never purchased this unit.

And folds neatly into a bag that we store out of the way. The warranty says 3 people at a time, but 4-5 30-40lb kids can jump on this all together.

We initially purchased the bounce house for our daughter's 3rd birthday party. We looked into renting one but it would have been similar or even more expensive than outright buying one. Sure, the quality is not anywhere near the commercial grade products but it's also a lot lighter and easier to move around. It comes with a carrying case about the size of a big duffle bag. We have used it mainly indoors (like in this video; it's anchored to the walls) but it has seen daylight on numerous occasions. As I said earlier we are using it almost every day to tire out the ever-energized kids especially if it's too nasty to go outside. The bouncer has no damage so far but one can tell that the places in which it always folds after deflation start leaking slightly. This is normal and it is futile to try and change the way it folds. I'm sure I'll get another year worth of fun for the family out of it, if not more.

We moved it under our deck, and although it was a tight squeeze, it fit.  The temperature was fine in the shade.  The other thing to keep in mind, the blower &#34;hose&#34; part sticks out the side (the side you can't see in the picture), and needs about an 8 foot clearance (not accounted for in the 9x12 dimensions).

We are starting to see signs of wear with only about 3-4 hours of use.  The seams, in more the only place, by the slide and on the part that is used for jumping are starting to come lose and raise.  I know this product is under warranty and reached out to their warranty department to file a claim, should be easy right... wrong... you essentially have to ""deface"" the product and show picture of the destruction to ensure no one else can use it (totally understand), but then it is taking them 4-6 weeks to send a replacement....  I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic, but seriously?  Why am I am going to break someone that is still technically ""usable"" at the moment (but falling apart) to have to wait a month and a half for a new one?  I even offered to pay upfront for a replacement bounce house to have it refunded  when we sent picture of the ""defaced"" product upon receipt of the new bounce house... That was also a no go..  At this point, we are contemplating returning the item to amazon and letting them deal with it...

The first being how much space it takes up and the louder noise the blower puts off.<br />B- super easy to blow up and set up.  Make sure you are plugged into GFI outlet as it may trip the breaker if now.<br />C - Be sure to look over the stitching.

145,1.0,Popped seam stitches with minimal use by toddler,"I got this last summer as an early birthday present for my soon to be 2 year old.  Because it was excessively hot and our yard has been in a state of constant construction, we've only been able to use the bouncer a handful of times.  We used it maybe 3 times before storing it away for Winter since we only use it outside (on top of a tarp mind you).  FFW to this Spring.... the first time we inflated it we noticed that the bouncer wasn't quite as full as it should be, and with closer inspection found the stitching popped at a seam on the side of the bouncer.  A friend of mine purchased the same bouncer and recommended contacting customer support about it for an exchange but I've been so busy I didn't get around to it until now.... 3 weeks after the 1 year mark covered by the warranty :/  My fault I suppose.  Still, I'm pretty disappointed that with such minimal use the seams started to pop.  We've never had more than a couple 2 and 3 year olds bounce inside it and always stored it properly.

163,5.0,We love ours indoors,"We bought this for Christmas for our kids 2 and 4 and we bought it to use in our finished basement. Our kids love the trampoline park and bouncy houses and it’s good exercise. Plus some of the reviews on here talking about it being a nap marker sounded good to us. I searched from the biggest bounce house that could fit indoors and found this. It does fit indoors and really isn’t to loud, I mean you are not watching tv next to it but it isn’t obnoxious either. The height is perfect for complete safety in an 8’ roommy kids can’t jump as high as the top arches and they are a couple feet lower the ceiling. The size isn’t to bad either we did bunch up the blower tube on the blower’s flange to shorten it way down and get it tighter to a wall on that side. The bounce house is well made and nice looking. The kids love this thing and even bargain with us for time in it for dressing quickly or doing fast baths. It a nice non-food treat when we need it to be.  They really do burn off a ton of energy in it also. A plus is that a two year old and four year old are pretty far apart on coordination and playing skills but are more or less equals in it, aside from the 2 year old not being able to climb back in on his own. The weight limit is 240lbs which makes it for kids only and mom. It’s definitely a toy that requires adult supervision but tossing balls back forth with the kids is fun for all of us, except our Lab who can’t understand why she can’t join in. Our basement family room is socks only so I can’t tell you about cleaning it as it is always clean. The kid’s friends are in awe when they see it and it’s nice entertainment for stay overs and gets them all to sleep early. It’s also nice on cold and rainy days to have a physical pay area for cooped up kids",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGM2QNWSUKRBQTUCHVPRWCIYSZ3Q,1522295509977,9,True

165,5.0,YES YES YES!,"First off, I feel really deprived that I didn’t have a bounce house when I was young.<br />Having gotten that off my chest I will keep this short because there are so many other detailed reviews.<br />Setup: out of the box 5 mins, every time thereafter, about 30 seconds to inflation.<br />It’s the most SIMPLE and basic setup! You COULD NOT mess it up.<br />Noise: it’s far more quiet than I was expecting. It’s like a hotel blow dryer. Higher pitch but not too loud.<br />Use: we got ours up today and set it up in the basement and it does NOT move around at all when the two kids (5 and 2) bounce in there. Tip: I saw a guy on a you tube video place pillows on the sides to prevent movement.<br />Fun level: 25/10  seriously though, my kids lost it when they saw this. My son has SPD, so it takes a LOT to tire him out and this def did! I agree with the post that calls this the “nap-maker”.<br />Quality: the material is thick and sturdy and that of quality material.<br />I would HIGHLY recommend if you have the space to get this!

I wanted to give a review because this thing is a blast for the kiddos!<br /><br />First off, we only use this indoors. If you use it outside I would purchase a tarp to set it on. This is not the outdoor heavy duty vinyl ones you rent. Its mild duty but works great. The setup takes maybe 2 minutes and you're done.<br /><br />Yes the blower is a bit noisy indoors (duh). Take a box slightly bigger than the blower. Put the blower inside. Cut a hole for the air tube to exit and cut a hole on the side of the box for the air suction.  The side hole for the air suction has quite a bit of suction power. Keep your kiddos long hair away from it. You would use this caution even with the blower outside the box. You're all set!<br /><br />We have had this for about 4yrs without major issue. There is one area in the front slide on the side where the seam is starting to slighty pull apart. Surprised it lasted this long. Im going to purchase a patch kit. This is par for the course. No major tears or blowouts for us. It has a reset button on the plug so you can easily turn it off an on. It rolls out in minutes and rolls up in minutes. Has a storage bag as well.

They made it out of so much cheaper material then my sisters bounce house and its suppose to be the same product. What really makes me mad is I am under the weight capacity and can easily jump on my sisters with the kids. Not this one! Hers was $50 cheaper too. So they upped the price and lowered the quality and lie about the weight capicity. The stitching is awful. There is left over stitching everywhere and is only a matter of time before my seems come on done just as others have reviewed.  Luckily I have a comparison to their previous quality of product.

I knew my youngest was pretty young and didn't know how she would do being bounced around by her big sister, but she loves it! I think it has helped her with balance and climbing (up the slide.) It also helps big sister get her need for rough play out of the way without hurting little sis. We have been using it regularly for 10 months and it has held up to a lot of rough use! It is so much safer for little kids than a trampoline, yet has all the &#34;wear-them-out&#34; benefits. We used it when my oldest turned 6 and we couldn't keep the kids out of it. All the parents were asking about it and couldn't believe the great deal I got on it! Yesterday it was raining and I put it up in the rec room.

263,1.0,"Poor, Poor Quality","When our previous bounce house became too small for our children I began researching new ones to buy for Christmas.  Bounce houses are wonderful for burning off energy especially if you can set it up indoors during cold winter months.  After seeing the high reviews on this website I was confident I was making the right choice in this bouncer, especially considering it carries the Little Tikes name.  Unfortunately I was very wrong.<br /><br />When the bouncer arrived on Christmas Eve 2010, I believe I was more excited than the children.  Upon opening the box I was extremely disappointed to find that the material the bouncer was made of was much, much thinner than our previous bouncer (which was also much less expensive) and the seams did not appear to be very sturdy. The material feels very similar to the material used to make a parachute, not very sturdy at all.  I tried to maintain my confidence in the Little Tikes name and the prior reviews.<br /><br />We set the bouncer up in a room in our home that was completely empty, even removing any molding or chips or anything that might damage it from the bottom of the room.  It was placed on high pile, very plush carpeting.  There were usually 2 children at a time using the bouncer with the exception of one time a child was exiting as another child was entering for a total of three children actually IN the house at a time, and this only happened once.  After just 5 uses (FIVE !!!!) the seam that connects the slide to the bouncer ripped open!  I immediately stopped using it and contacted Little Tikes, feeling confident they would at the least send a patch to repair it if not replace it.  I could not believe my ears when the representative told me that I have voided the warranty by using the product indoors and they would do nothing to fix the problem.  To add insult to injury while I was on the phone with them I attempted to turn on the blower which immediately began to ""short"" on and off.  They were still unwilling to fix the problem.  I am filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  Spend a little extra money and buy something of better quality.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AEXAC2AVGZ2VU6A55YAC7HEOF6ZQ,1295377817000,117,False

It came with stakes for securing it outdoors. I did not secure mine to anything indoors because the children using it are so small. It rotates around a few degrees while in use so I will eventually need to rig up some sandbags or something I can use to hold it in place without drilling holes in my floor.<br />Setting this up was easy- I unrolled it, tied two knots, and then turned on the inflator. It took about 1 minute for this to fully inflate. There is a door on the back side where kids can enter and then they can slide out. In my experience, the children are entering and exiting via the slide.<br /><br />I like that the blower is relatively small and it does not get hot. The blower makes a noise a little louder than a white noise machine. It is not excessive, but I can hear it running from upstairs. If you want quiet, this is not a toy for you. Your children will be shrieking with delight. If you can work through the noise, they require minimal supervision while at play.

319,5.0,Hours of Fun for the Whole Family,"We purchased this bounce house four years ago and for the most part has held up well. Here's some insight for future purchasers to extend the longevity of the bounce house.<br /><br />1. Invest in a 10x10 tarp place it underneath the bounce house to prevent moisture from penetrating the bottom every use.<br /><br />2. Mildew WILL grow on this if you use it outside (which is 99% of us) So what do you do? While the bounce house is inflated spray Clorox bleach on the effected surface and let dry. Looks brand new.<br /><br />3. Do not put away wet. If it rains while in use. Turn off the motor, disconnect from power source, when the rain stops, power up and turn the motor on and let it dry.<br /><br />4. Use Clorox wipes on the parts that get jumped on (inside and slide) after every use.<br /><br />Use these tips and you will have this bounce house for years to come.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AqQS9QtXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AqQS9QtXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AqQS9QtXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cDT2kBBGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cDT2kBBGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cDT2kBBGL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGMRMXYJITANJKJWRE22UGUIOYQA,1567895876503,283,True

386,4.0,"Two years later, it's still going strong.","I bought this Jump N Slide from the big toy store down the street when it was 20% off.  We've used it for two years and it's been a lot of fun.  Honestly, I thought I would use it more but it's enough of a pain for me to pull out and set up that I haven't used it as much as I thought I would.  It's not that hard to set up, just heavy for me to dig out of the shed and lug across the yard.<br /><br />DURABILITY: My kids were 5 and 2 when I purchased it.  It's been up for various birthday parties and summer weekends over two years.  I've never let more than three kids on at a time (as per the rules).  I also have a rule of no touching the sides.  All of our seams have held just find.  The kids enjoy flinging themselves on to the slide so the gets the bulk of the wear and tear and, it too, has held up just great.  I make sure not to leave it out in the sun.  There are quite a few reviews on here about seams bursting so maybe I was just lucky and got a good one or maybe I've been taking care of mine.<br /><br />SET UP: Take the jumper out of the bag, roll it out, hook it up, and turn on the blower.  It sets up in just a few minutes and is ready to go.  The generator is loud so that isn't the most fun to hear at parties but you get that with any inflatable run off of a generator.  It did come with plastic stakes to anchor but I never felt the need to.  The nice thing is that the storage bag has plenty of room to roll the jumper up and put away.  I don't feel like I need to roll it up super tight to make it all fit.  The blower will not fit in the bag.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this jumper if you have little kids, like 6 and under.  It's small so it doesn't take up too much space in your yard and is a great way to let them blow off steam.  A huge bouncy rental can cost over $100 for one day so this is a deal if you have a few kids.  Remember, no more than 3 kids at a time!",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AH7TIBMNMH5LLET7RHH62AKAR56A,1347895503000,16,False

Other than that, I highly recommend this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uu6Ob-bkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uu6Ob-bkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uu6Ob-bkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WKpefcGeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WKpefcGeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WKpefcGeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGBABIFJ4QVWFHWWODEY7PP3CI7Q,1549813507932,0,True

411,5.0,Gets used over and over.,"Someone last year gave us a Little Tikes Jump 'n Slide Bouncer. I'm not normally in the habit of reviewing kid's toys, but this one gave us a ton of use. With a long power cord, the blower for this bouncer still requires a power strip: the reason is because the wall wart is nasty and long, and wouldn't fit into any weather protected wall sockets, so you have to use a power strip for it. Fortunately, the power draw is relatively low (400W maximum). It comes with several stakes for holding down the bounce house on grass/lawn, but since we usually use it on a wooden deck or concrete we rarely use those.<br /><br />In use, the bounce house mostly works great, but Bowen can reach the roof and pull it down. Similarly, Boen has discovered if he slides against the walls the roof will come down and he can grab it as well. For whatever reason the kids think this is great fun, but so far after a good 6 months of use the toy has still not fallen apart.<br /><br />For Bowen's birthday party, we decided we'd rent a generator and run this jump house instead of renting a bigger jump house. But renting a generator cost $200, while a Tailgator from harbor freight cost only $109. I tried shopping from Amazon, but because of California's air quality regulations and because most generator companies can't be bothered to present their California certification to Amazon, you can't buy such low end devices from them. Along with the generator, you'll have to get 2 cycle engine oil and fuel stabilizer. Since the Tailgator was good for 700W it was perfectly matched with the bouncer. (Note: the generator has a 25 hour break-in period, during which you're not supposed to exceed 50% of the maximum wattage the generator's supposed to provide, so 400W is about right)<br /><br />The generator requires more maintenance than you would expect: you're supposed to run it every 3 months for at least 15 minutes, but since one use of it has already paid for itself I'm not too concerned about the longevity.<br /><br />Most kid's toys get played once or twice and then are left to languish. This one gets used over and over, so I recommend it if you have the room.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AHB6G2CKXFTG6GVUTM2RAHH7KMTQ,1509993580198,1,False

453,4.0,Great activity for 1 or 2 small kids,"It truly does set up in under a minute - very quick and easy! I love that it comes with its own fabric carrying case for the house itself.<br /><br />The 2 minor drawbacks are that the slide itself is not really slick, so they aren't actually sliding down you're basically scooting - and the second is that the door is very secure so it is difficult for little ones to actually crawl in.  This is also a plus though as they wont fall out.<br /><br />It does take up a fair amount of space - but I would say comfortably only 1-3 kids at a time ... And those would be little ones! My 2 year old enjoys it all to himself and might not agree that there is room for anyone else to join him!<br /><br />The motor is arguably quieter than I had imagined - I can carry on a conversation with my 2 year old, but I think it would be too loud to be indoors like in a basement.<br /><br />This is only our first time using it - and the fabric does seem thin, but so far is holding up to the jumper no and claiming of a 36lb 2 year old tank!<br /><br />This will be great when we have friends over and for days when we just have too much energy and need an outlet.

Calling Little Tikes first thing in the AM.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Little tikes couldnt care less about their customers or their product's safety..  first they told me that holes are there for a reason - to let the air out as kids jump ( that i know and those dedicated holes look different than numerous other holes i contacted them about).  then they decided to give me a runaround and asked for detailed photos of everything form A-Z. I complied and sent them everything, including clear photos of large holes in-between seams - large enough to stick a finger through........their answer:  PATCH IT UP.  You cant possibly patch holes in-between seams, and the bouncer has at least 15 of those, all they offered is extra patches, and then stopped responding altogether.  When calling, every rep has the same answer - &#34;someone will call you back within 24 hrs&#34;, but weeks later i am still waiting for that very first promised call back.

From totally flat to fully inflated takes about a minute and a half. The motor is a little noisy, but not overwhelming.  With its basic design the interior area for jumping is large (compared to others we looked at) and the overall height allows for easy inside use, if you have the floor space. The wide slide is a nice feature, too.  The material and overall construction seems quite sturdy.  It's easy to deflate and move around, or roll up to store if desired (comes with a carry bag).<br /><br />My grandkids run and play outside every day in good weather, but need an outlet to burn off some energy now that it's too cold to get out.

585,3.0,Mixed Feelings,"Mixed Feelings<br />We bought this for our 4-almost-5-year-old because, like most children, she loves to jump and we didn’t want a trampoline and liked that it was “portable”. Our plan is to use it for her birthday party outside and then put it in the basement for the colder months when she is climbing the walls with energy.<br />Since receiving the blow up structure, we found that it blew up in less than a minute. She and I were super excited. We left it outside that night and the sprinklers got it wet. We blew it up the next day, we noticed that there were quite a few holes near all the seams – the water was bubbling. I’m not sure if this is meant to be ventilation or if it wasn’t sealed properly but the unit still inflates and stays inflated.<br />We’ve had four 4-5 year olds in it at one time and it supports them, however the kids tend to hang from the yellow inflated arches at the top. I feel like the arches should be more firm as with professional bounce houses. Being that they top arches aren’t very supportive, the kids sometimes fall in between the net and the wall and get stuck (they laugh, but I worry).  All-in-all, the structure stays standing even with all the rough play and hanging from the arches.<br />One last comment: The bouncy floor doesn’t seem as “bouncy” as other jumping structures, but that’s a trade off for convenience and price. Bottom line: She likes it and I like that she likes it. Now, let’s all take a nap!",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AHSIU6HH3JDKFUGIBQH6B3WSFMXQ,1468435989000,4,True

604,3.0,"Fun for the first few times, but has lost it's sturdiness over time and seems to have developed more holes","Purchased as a gift for a 3-year-old's birthday. He was beyond thrilled with it and it worked so well the first few times we set it up. Unfortunately, however, over time it has lost it's sturdiness and does not seem to hold as much air as it used to and seems to have developed more holes after each use (Somewhere in the product description or on the box, it tells me that this is normal, but I'm not too convinced). This makes me a little concerned about the safety of using this (If this trend continues, will it provide enough support and cushion when my kid jumps and bounces hard on it?) and its overall longevity. For an item in this high price range, I would expect that it would last at least two years, but I'm not sure that we will make it there. We only use it once every few months so it's not like we're overusing or abusing it either. I wish they would come up with a better way to connect the air pump to the bouncer --- it often shifts to the side causing the bouncer to deflate. If you are buying this for one-time use for a birthday party (which makes sense as it costs about as much as a rental anyhow), then I would recommend it, but I'm not convinced that it will last that long if you want it to use repeatedly as an everyday kind of toy.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AEV2GYKRQ27GRTECYDXWQPG4U3KA,1416324135000,4,True

We had only used it a few times before it got moldy and we never put water on it. I was so disgusted by the black mold spots that I actually bleached the thing and let it sit out in the sun for a few hours and then hosed it off, letting it dry completely before storing it.

755,5.0,This is a very well designed consumer bounce house and is easy to operate.,"Works great! Amazed how quickly I can get it up and running (about five minutes out of the bag) and about four minutes back in the bag(including deflation!)  Incredible product.  I can’t see any wear and tear issues from the design looking up close.  It is pretty straight forward: a smaller design of the commercial fan powered bounce house.  Fits great in the basement thanks to the top not running unnecessarily tall, but tall enough to keep the age range safe.  I will update if there are any issues that arise over the next year!  I have seen it priced on Amazon at $199-$249 but bought mine from Amazon Warehouse for a lot less and couldn’t be happier! The only negative maybe that there is an opening at back of bounce house(opposite side of slide) that a little one may bounce out of if they have a lot of force behind them but they would have to be hauling to break through Velcro fasteners.<br /><br />UPDATE October 2019:<br />Still running at full fun, no joke! This is a great product!  The kids are bigger and 2 years older(7 and 4), but not near the max weight limit.  I can’t say enough about the build quality.  Perfect size for a modest sized basement.

818,4.0,The Jump n Slide versus the Jr. Jump n Slide,"First we bought the Jr. Jump n Slide thinking it was similar but smaller. Unfortunately I thought the weight limit was the same and it's not so I returned it and we got this one. There are some differences between the Junior and the regular. I returned it mainly because I paid $199 for the Jr. Jump n Slide and this one is $188. So it's cheaper, bigger and can hold more weight!<br /><br />The Junior is smaller, so it's probably a better size if you want to use it in the house. I know it says for outdoor use only, but we had planned on using it inside, especially for the long winters when you can't go out. The Junior fit nicely in our living room. The tube to inflate was in the back, so it worked nice as a setup as well for where our outlets are. There is only one entrance to the Jr. Jump n Slide and that is the slide in front. I liked that. The down side is it could tip more easily if the kids got wild. You can't tie it down with stakes inside. The 160 lb weight limit said it was for 2 kids but we had 3 young kids and it was fine. The blower wasn't that loud. It was easy to set up!<br /><br />The Jump n Slide is quite a bit bigger than the Jr. It still fits in our living room--just barely! The hose to inflate is on the right side, which is less convenient for us. Thank goodness the blower has a very long cord. Right away you can see that the material in the bounce section is a lot thicker than the Jr. The bounce section of the Jr. is made of the same nylon material all over, but this one has an extra thick material in the bounce section. I'm glad it can hold up to 250 lbs! Ours has an entrance in the middle of the back which I don't like. I'm worried one of the kids will fall out the back! I liked the one entrance of the Jr. better. The blower is bigger and louder, which it would have to be because the bouncer is bigger and can hold more weight. There is also a second tube which you tie shut when you inflate. It makes deflating easier than the Jr. because the air has a big place to come out. I feel like this bouncer is more sturdy and less likely to tip. Again, you're supposed to use it outside only and tie it down with stakes but we will probably be using it inside. I think this is a very sturdy bouncer. I was able to get inside and bounce a little bit and I didn't feel like there was an issue. There's no way I even wanted to stand up in the Jr., I would crawl in and sit with my daughter as she bounced. I hope that this will last my daughter a long time!<br /><br />Overall this one is better than the Jr. minus the opening in the back. I wish this one didn't have it. Maybe some of them don't, but the one I was sent does have it. It is held shut by two small strips of Velcro. If I have issues with kids falling out of the back I will first try to sew more strips of Velcro on it to hold it shut. If that doesn't work, I'm going to stitch it shut all the way.<br /><br />Okay, the picture on the box is NOT the exact same as the product! That is misleading! The back is different because ours has an arch on the back and a back entrance and the stitching is different on the jumping part on the actual bouncer.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because of the entrance at the back. If it didn't have that I'd give it 5!",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGKDQGBINI6S72O3WAXQA5WWZXPA,1441164119000,7,True

890,1.0,"Good for 10-20 Uses, Expect it to Rip Under normal use","I set this Christmas present from Santa up in my basement for my 2 and 4 year olds. The loved it. They used it every day - and it was great to have considering how cold it has been this winter. My 4 year old went to the back through the mesh door and it tore the door seam on the arch about 8 inches on January 15th. THE END.<br /><br />Here is the good - size is right, fan was well built and worked well, it really has a lot good going for it. I just can't get past how poorly designed the door is. I saw another brand uses a Hobbit House style door - now I know why. The price was right.<br /><br />The bad - most seams appear to be double stiched. I would think that 3 or 4 stitches would be better. I think there may have only been a single stich seam where mine ripped. So it looks and feels nice but overall is poor quality.<br /><br />The ugly (why I give Little Tikes 1 star) - having to box this ripped piece of junk up in front of my kids and explaining to them I have to ship it back to Santa in the North Pole so he can fix it. And go figure - there are no more to replace it and nothing else on Amazon that will fit in my basement (7 foot ceilings are a killer). So I will avenge Little Tikes with 1 start and probably will not buy anything else from them because I know where it will end up after limited use.<br /><br />My advice - if you think you will use this 15 times in 4 years it is not a bad buy. If you will use this frequently then invest in a better quality product.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AH5VHMHCNTU3LXDF2EIEAJ76BIHA,1390874835000,5,True

930,5.0,Bounce House=Mommy Time,"To my fellow mothers… Buy this thing immediately! I am a mother of a 3 1/2-year-old, an 18-month-old, and an eight week old, and this jumper is a fabulous addition to our backyard. Obviously the newborn does not enjoy it yet,  but my older two love it.  I was hesitant to get this jumper at first because it was a large purchase, but it has been worth every penny. Every time we have a play date at our house, every single parent comments how awesome it is. We call it the &#34;babysitter&#34;.<br /><br />Things to know about this jumper:<br />1. It really is not for older children. I find that my kids are at the perfect age for it.  The two of them can jump and have plenty of room to have fun. We could also fit quite a few of their small friends with them.  I have nephews that are seven and I find that they are just getting to be too big for it.  Or should I say, you can only really fit a few seven-year-olds as opposed to quite a few toddlers. I think I like it so much because my kids are so young and I see the potential for using it for many years. As long as it doesn't pop or the motor break, I feel like it could have a good 10+ year life in our backyard.<br />2. I live in south Louisiana and I find that it is just too hot to use in the summer. I think the one with the roof on it would be great if you live in a really hot area.  It's perfect most months here except for the few really hot summer months. I did attempt to put it in the shade this summer for the kids to use, but then all the debris from the tree (sticks, leaves, acorns, bird poop, etc.) ended up in the jumper and it wasn't worth having to clean it all out.<br />3. Set up and take down is really quite easy. From taking it out of the bag to hooking up the motor and tying off the two air chambers, it takes me less than five minutes. Taking it down is more work because you have to wait until all the air is out of it before you can really roll it up tight to fit in the bag. I don't find it takes that long to deflate it totally. I normally turn the motor off, it deflates immediately, and then I fold it over and let my three-year-old stomp on it until most of the air is out.<br />4. You have to be careful of moisture. If you get any moisture on the jumper and then store it in the bag, you might see some mold growing on it when you take it out again. It's not the bad mold, it's more like the musty dirt you start to see on things like life jackets after it's been used for quite a while. I've made the mistake of leaving it outside all day and going to pick it up after dark only to realize that the bottom has dew on it since the temperature changed. I then pull it to our patio and roll it up the next day once it's completely 100% dry.<br />5. After it is all rolled up and in the bag, it is a bit heavy. However, it's not too heavy for the average mom. I'm 5'2 and 115 pounds, and I can handle it just fine. I like that it actually rolls up into a fairly small size given how big it is when in use. I would say it's the equivalent of a really, really big sleeping bag (the size, not the weight).<br /><br />If you plan to have any of your young child/children's birthday parties at your house, this thing is totally worth the investment. Renting a large fun jump for just one day is around $300. This is something that you can use over and over again. We've already used it for two birthday parties. If we would've rented fun jumps for each of those we could've bought three of these. Seems like a no-brainer.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGNBUJRKC2YWOJG62QDX5VTQXPPA,1477601868000,24,True

It is really that simple.  Putting it away is likewise quick and easy.  It seems to be very rugged for a non commercial product and I believe it will last for years. The best part of it is they will completely exhaust themselves bouncing in it OUTSIDE.  If I have any complaints, it is that the material is not waterproof.  If it is outside and it begins to rain, you will have a wet bounce house that must be thoroughly dried before putting it away.  That is accomplished by inflating it and sun drying.

However, a seam let go at one end after just a few days use, so I was dubious about my expensive purchase. But, the folks at YoYo were terrific over the phone and I had a replacement less than two days later. The boys have been using the second one rigorously for over a month without any incident and we absolutely love it. They can inflate it in less than ten seconds and be ready to jump and bounce, and it easily handles their weight together(90 & 80 lbs, it's rated for 250 lbs). It keeps them occupied and exercising in the fresh air for hours. It's very well constructed and still looks new after a month of outside use. We got a plastic storage tub to keep the inflatable part in, you can get it in the included blue nylon bag but it's a lot of work, you can roll it up and put it in a tub in seconds and it's safe from the rain. We've had absolutely no problems with it, and ultimately concluded our first one was defective.

I decided to go with the cheaper version that does not have a top thinking that the canapé would get in the way (height wise) jumping.<br />A few things to take into consideration:<br />1. The kids can now hang on the sides which will collapse very easily causing them to get &#34;stuck&#34; in the netting without a canapé (parent supervision will just need to be required).<br />2. Do NOT put this out in the sun, keep it in a shaded area.  The sun beating down on the material that the floor is made out of will get VERY hot, and any skin contact and you will know it. Work around is perhaps pants and socks and long sleeve shirts.<br />3. The only other &#34;Con&#34; about this is the spikes provided to keep the bounce house down.  I just used a rubber mallet of course, and have used the bounce house 3 times so far.  3 of the spikes are now bent because they are just plastic.  I will need to replace these perhaps make my own out of wood or something.<br />I still think as my son gets older and jumps higher it was a good idea to get the open roof type so he can jump with no restrictions.

1094,4.0,Great buy!  Wish I had it when I was a kid.,"The Little Tikes Jump 'n Slide is great!  It would be 5 stars, but for a few small issues.  First, the directions indicate that you are not to use it with an extension cord.  Unfortunately, the plug was too big to fit in any of my outside outlets.  Second, you need to put it in the shade if it's hot outside.  Yes, I know that it's going to get hot, but it gets really hot.  It's not Tikes fault, its just the nature of the material.  If you plan to use it in the sun, you might consider the one with the roof.  The only other issue I had was that it was easy for kids to fall out the back.  The netting uses velcro on the side opposite the slide.  In theory that is the entrance, since there is a shoe holder there, but my kids always run up the slide.  Overall, if you can get this on sale, it's a great a buy and a lot of fun for the kiddos.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AFFCPRJ3INVPIW2YYD4I4AIDKT6Q,1469810197000,4,True

Some loose strings along some of the seams that we had to clip with scissors, but nothing too major. My kids (2 and 4) have used it every day so far I think, mostly because it's cold out (thankfully we can fit it in our basement). It really tires them out and they enjoy it immensely. It's pretty easy to move around indoors, so it does slide around a bit since I can't stake it down. Takes me only a couple minutes to get it out and set up, and inflates in ~30 seconds. The longest part of putting it away is getting all the air out of it as I'm folding it up, I usually let the kids roll on it to push the air out.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied.

1233,5.0,Hours of fun,"I got this jumper for a party we were having. I paid just under two hundred. It would have cost one seventy-five to rent a professional size jumper for a few hours so I thought this would be a great permanent alternative. I read the reviews about defective items and was willing to take a chance, because i know three families that own little tykes bounce houses and love them. It arrived in the time it was supposed to, and we did not open it until the day of the event. When you open the box there is a big warning on the box that says you CANNOT return the item once the box is open, but you cannot see the notice until you open the box. ( very sneaky ) there is info on how to contact little tykes if you have a problem. It went together perfectly and we staked it down as per the instructions. Plugged in and turned on, it inflated quickly and the kids did not hesitate to jump in. It remained on for over 5 hours of the party. It had almost constant use that whole time. It's perfect for 3 or less kids at time, but 4 can use it no problem the age range at the party was 1-8 years old and everyone enjoyed it and no one was injured.  We have used it no less than 10 more times since the party, one month ago. We inflated it inside the house as well. It is very sturdy, well made and continues to work well even with my 3 crazy monster children. When you unplug the fan, it resets at the plug, and you have to hit a button on the plug to turn it on as well as the on/off switch on the fan. If someone has issues with it not staying inflated and the walls not holding up, it is most likely because the vent on the side is not properly tied closed. Read the instruction and use caution ( don't let the kids touch or move the fan) and it should last a long time. FYI you need an additional 8 feet on the side the fan is on for proper set up inside a house, so make sure you have enough floor space to properly set it up before you buy it!  Very happy with my purchase, I think it will last a long time.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AERKO3EWSLQCOV6C3TPDFNW55PBQ,1377177666000,1,True

1298,1.0,Shameful,"I read through numerous reviews on this product before purchase. There were consistent complaints about the slide coming apart, but overall people left good reviews so I decided to get it. I bought this as a family Christmas gift and let the kids open it two days early. They have been enjoying it immensely. Today I noticed a seam on the blue part of the slide starting to unravel and open up. Upon further inspection, the exterior corner on that same seam was starting to come apart as well. I had to kick the kids out and deflate it before the areas completely opened up. There is so much air escaping from the larger area, which is several inches long, that it feels like someone is trying to blow out birthday candles. The patches will be completely useless since this is a seam issue and not a puncture. It will eventually open up in other areas along that same seam. Obviously this is a defect in craftsmanship. I am unable to contact customer service today since it is Christmas, and they are closed. The point of the matter is this. Even if customer service is amazing and has a representative personally walk a new one over from the factory with an apology card signed by every member of the production team, that still would not rectify this situation. I should not have to deal with this problem from a product two days out of the box. As a full-time nurse and single mother, I work hard for my money, and free time is in short supply. I expect a reputable company like Little Tikes to work equally hard in exchange for my hard earned money and time. It is an implied expectation that every consumer rightfully has. Was their quality control guy on his lunch break when this was passed through inspection? Merry Christmas kids! Enjoy your tarp.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QCyx-VxyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QCyx-VxyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QCyx-VxyL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PMokZy3CL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PMokZy3CL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PMokZy3CL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AHANSSVHEA6IH6YWOPPTZWVYRQGQ,1545777409843,156,True

1592,5.0,Little Tykes Jump N Slide Bouncer,"We bought this as a birthday gift for my 1 and 3 year old. We live in a condo complex, so renting a bouncy house is not something they will allow us to do. We bought this because it seemed like something we could set up and tear down easily, while providing some fun for the little ones. So far it has been a huge hit. Kids as old as 8 have been bouncing away in it, having a great time. The eldest kids will say that it is not as bouncy as the big ones - and they're right. But the little ones don't notice. I wish they made a ball pit to go at the bottom of the slide, that would be so fun!<br /><br />The bouncy house blows up in about 3 minutes, once you have it set up and plugged in. It only takes about 3-5 minutes to set it up before that. As soon as the house is inflated, you hammer in the pegs to the ground (another 3-5 minutes), and you're good to go. We did find that if you do not use the stakes to stabilize it, it does move around when the kids are jumping. It is very easy to fold up, then roll up for storage when done using. That whole process takes about 10 minutes. The house and stakes fit into the carry bag that is included. It is not light to carry around but it is great to be able to take it to family's house if we're going for the day. The blower is included, but will not fit in the carry bag. It has its own handle though, and I've carried both pieces at the same time without too much difficulty.<br /><br />We set ours up on the side of our condo on a bed of mulch with a tarp laid down to protect the house from any punctures. It is approximately 9' x 12' when inflated. So far we have had no issues with this. The cord from the blower is quite long, and reaches to the plug just inside the door of our condo. The blower has to be placed almost perpendicular to the bouncy house, 5-6 feet away, on the right side to function correctly with the sleeve that delivers the air.<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend this product. If you have the space and want hours of entertainment for your little ones, do it. The price is right and they will love it!",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGFPMAHI7TZP6RBYYAL3D3GL7DIA,1474999437000,2,True

This sucker is heavy duty construction, inflates in less than a minute (3 year old grand daughter loves to lay in it while it inflates) and is very well made. Set up time, first time through, 15 minutes. After that, 5 min., nothing to it. Had a birthday party for my little sputnick and the dry bouncer was the center of attention. Kids loved it just for getting in it, parents thought it was the best thing they'd ever seen because of the quality of construction and the kids were all in the same spot (easier to keep track of 'um). Like myself, they all thought the material was going to be of the dime store quality kiddie swimming pool that costs a buck fiddy, and deflates when you look at it. This thing is a serious kid entertainer and well worth the money. We've used it  at least a half a dozen times since early april 2013. By the By, not all the kids were 3 year olds, there were a coupla of 5 & 6 year olds in the bunch and the bouncer didn't even flinch. I'm gonna say it! Buy this thing! Whew!

1704,1.0,Poor Quality,"We purchased the Little Tikes Jump n Slide in February.  Our four year old son used it about 10 times.  After having a baby in April I noticed the stitching had come undone.  I contacted Little Tikes in May (silly me), the warranty was up and they would not repair or replace.  We would have been better off hiring one.  I was very surprised that Little Tikes would not have better quality assurance measures.

1746,5.0,Is your hyperactive kid driving you nuts? Buy it now. Thank me later.,"I bought this bouncy house 10 YEARS AGO and it is still going strong. I bought it for my ADHD children to get some energy out before nap time and it was worth every penny. I used to jump in it with the kids a bit but the blower gets a little unhappy with too much air back flow from my weight. So unless you are 100 lbs or less I would just throw a few kids in there and watch them lose their minds. Perfect for little kids and I strongly recommend it for “spirited” children.<br />A few noteworthy tips:<br />1.It’s loud so don’t plan on meditating or quiet activities while it’s on but you have kids so that isn’t happening anyway.<br />2. Don’t let it get wet and then wrap it up. It will mold and that’s no fun. I did it and had to clean it with disinfectant and it’s big so it took 4 hours.<br />3. Don’t put it on cement because it slides around when not anchored and when the kids come down the slide they push it backwards shoving themselves into a cracked skull and an ER visit.<br />4. Get a margarita and enjoy the Hour (or 2 if you’re lucky)<br />5. It’s a bitch getting it in that bag so make sure you get your kids to roll across it a few times and get the air out or it’s not going to work, no matter how good at origami you are.<br />6. Take care of it and it will last for a long time.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AHSKNOZ3UMGEQU5N6DQIEG7UASPQ,1556424556056,2,False

The first time my son went in it and jumped (he is only 42lbs) we heard a loud pop and after finding where it came from we found that the seam holding the slide to the main house popped a hole.  This didn't seem to effect the air holding so we decided it would be fine.  The next week the kids used it nothing abusive but used it for its purpose and sure enough we noticed it wasn't holding the air like it had and found another hole where the slide connected but this time the air was escaping, then upon further investigation we found that the seams along the slide were stretching and allowing air to escape.<br />All in all the quality of the same product purchased over 5yrs ago is NO WHERE NEAR the lack of quality this one had.

I was expecting the item to be in good condition but unfortunately it wasn’t. The box had taped (not by the manufacturer) all over and some of the edges of the box were slightly open. When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was that the bouncer was just stuffed inside the box. As I pulled it out, I noticed a big tear and black skid mark on the side of the bouncer. I called Amazon customer service to inform them of the issue and was told that they could only refund me the money or exchange the item for another like new/used bouncer.

No problem, I push the couch in the basement back and pop this thing up for a few hours of bouncy time.

It is currently in the smallest room in our house, so it does give advantage to rushdown players, so would recommend for kids like my niece Konny Jage.<br />One thing you have to be careful with, make sure you use the no blood code before you play, otherwise your child could be playing around with reverse uppercut combos and land in a pit of spikes, just a warning.<br /><br />Should be very suitable for Rain since the pushback on his 4Rh in the corner is similar to Jages F33B3, and is only -3 so you have an easy AA setup or can repeat 4RH, just like Jage.<br /><br />Be careful letting certain types of pointy items on there like Marakas because they can easily puncture it, just be aware of that weakness and try to turn it into a strength, newborn airbournes love it, little Lung Kaos.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGQD62XWLADWCZSBWS5YXOZMDRZA,1363722317000,17,False

This is much safer and she has a wonderful time. We put ours up outside and with just her in it, we don't even have to use any sandbags to hold it down.  We have never let more than 3 toddlers in it at a time and nobody has ever gotten hurt.  I can even get in it and sit while she jumps around me. It literally only takes seconds to inflate and taking it down is not any harder than folding up and putting away a tent. I have no problem when she asks me to use it.  It's really very simple. I also have never seen a change in my electric bill from using it and sometimes we have had it running several hours a day.

2203,5.0,Best birthday present we got for our 6 year-old,"I would recommend this bounce house 100%.  It is very durable and blows up in 32 seconds!  My son plays in it almost every day after school.  Its size is 9' x 12' and fits downstairs in our house.  We have these very soft material balls that I throw/kick/pitch into the bounce house for him to catch so we both have fun.  Every time he has a friend over, they play in and out of it for hours.  I think the big hit on this type of bounce house is the slide.  They LOVE sliding out of it as they slide, jump slide, backwards slide, etc.  It deflates quickly and folds up so I can move it to the side of the room.  I haven't tried putting it back into the bag yet, as it gets used all the time.  Great Product!!!",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AFGWI34PW2FQSOJKHZZUBSCKW7HA,1298648705000,1,True

2353,4.0,Excitingly large so much fun for smaller children only!,"We ordered this for our nephew as his first birthday gift. I opened up the package and set it up in our yard the day before we gave it to him to make sure the product was working and in brand new condition.<br />The bouncy house is very easy to set up it took only about 15 minutes. We used a very thick tarp underneath to protect the bottom, even if it is on the grass. Placed the stakes in the ground for safety. We set up the blower and it was up in seconds. It is very large has a slide which is made of lighter cheaper material I thought should be stronger because the children go back in the bouncer up the slide, if their climbers it is great but if they are just starting out there are no grips or ribbing to help them get up the slide. There is also a back exit with a Velcro closing. I suggest supervision on both sides so no one falls out of that side and as well as helping them up and down the slide.<br />His birthday came and we had it set up as a surprise for him and his cousins they were thrilled to bouncy!<br />I didn't feel the price point met the product standards for The Little Tikes quality I was expecting! We had another brand when our children were younger that is no longer in business. If you are going to spend the money, do your research on the the materials this products is made of. I was mistaken by the material not being as thick in material millimeters for the strength it will need for long lasting wear and tear. We are not going to return the product because of it being a gift and he and his cousins have used it. They are toddlers and I hope it will last at least a couple of years. By the end if the time they used it that day the material where the slide comes down had loosened stiches and it was only used by 3- 2 and 3 year old toddlers with adult supervision.<br />Little Tikes has always had a good reputation, so this was exciting to see there product name on this. If you are interested in purchasing this product and you like the price point then it will be a good purchase for your little ones. There are many more choices for a little bit more money that are made of more commercial materials that may suit your children better. Think about the children's weight, ages of children using product; if your the neighborhood house like we were back in the day the usage of the product will need to be more of commercial grade.

2414,5.0,"Not the same as the professionals, but a good solid home unit for younger kids at a fraction of the cost.","I used to work for a party rental company that rented out professional-grade inflatable bouncers.  This one costs a fraction of the cost of one of those -- in fact it doesn't cost much more than renting one -- and it's built on the same principles.  What's different are the materials.  If you understand what you're getting, I think this is a great option and well worth the money.  If you're expecting the same thing the professional companies have, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />So the three differences between this product and the expensive ones:<br />1.  The size -- this is big enough to hold 3 or 4 kids comfortably -- we had 7 in it at one point and it worked fine but was fairly crowded.  The professional ones vary in size but all the ones I've seen are bigger.<br />2.  Both are made of vinyl, but the vinyl on the pro ones is more durable (and it tends to be smooth, while this one is textured).  I was pleased with this product.  I believe it would stand up to regular home use fine for quite a while, but it's certainly thinner and that would make it less puncture resistant than the pricier pro ones.  On the plus side, it's only ~35 pounds, instead of a couple hundred pounds for the ones you get from the party rental companies.<br />3.  All of these leak air at the seams -- this product and the pro grade ones.  That's normal.  The air blower is continuously running to make up for it.  More kids, or heavier kids, or harder jumping will push more air out at a time, and requires a stronger blower to make up for it.  The blower included here works great, but is less powerful than the more expensive higher end models come with.  7 and 8 year old kids noticed a slight difference here -- not quite as bouncy -- but it didn't keep them from having a great time.  If you're looking for something to handle teenagers or adults, this probably isn't up for the challenge.<br /><br />I was very pleased with this product, and for only $50 more than renting a bounce house for a weekend we now own one we can use again and again.  Younger kids didn't seem to notice a difference.  In fact, one of my kids said it was just like the the others.  However, if you want something for older kids, or you're expecting the exact same thing you've seen at businesses,  you may be disappointed.  This is a home grade unit, but a nice one at a fraction of the cost.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AHVPOUYNKIILR3Q3GPIF7MEYW7BA,1383442245000,232,True

2458,1.0,Terrible Construction; EVEN WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"We have owned this product for less than a year.  I have 3 year old twin girls who have used this it &lt;10 times, and they weigh less that 35 lbs each.  This bouncer is rated for children from 3-8 years old, up to 3 jumpers at a time, up to 250 lbs.  One of the seams on the slide had broken open and there is now a 4 inch gaping hole in the slide.  I called the customer service number provided on the product and was very simply and in a matter of fact tone told that this product has a 90 day warranty and there for there was nothing they could do for me.  I was shocked.  You are toy maker, and you put a 90 day warranty on a child's fabric play toy; but more over I was shocked that they would not make an exception because it was PRODUCT DEFAULT and not user error or misuse.  I could completely understand enforcing their warranty policy if the hole was cause by us, or was in an area where it was clearly created by a user.  But this was a seam that came undone.  Little Tikes has done little at this point than prove that they make faulty products, and then do not stand behind them.  I understand that nothing is perfect, and no company produces 100% perfect products, but I don't understand a company that doesn't stand behind their products.  The resolution she offered me was to buy some shoe goo and a vinyl patch.  How well do you think this will hold with rambunctious 3 year olds on the SLIDE portion of the toy.  Not a great alternative to standing behind the products you make.<br /><br />I have request a call from a supervisor in their customer service department after the agent I was speaking to, Pam McClain, became annoyed, indifferent, and dismissive.  She assured me that either Charlize or Danielle would be calling me shortly.  I am not holding my breath based on the terrible customer service we have gotten so far.<br /><br />It is a shame.  I will always think twice before buying Little Tikes now.  You would think in this day, with social networking and the internet and how fast things spread, they would try a little harder to keep clients.

Right off the bat we learned a very important lesson....the plastic gets HOT if it's out in the sunshine!  It became too uncomfortable for bare feet in less than 15 min of KS sunshine.  Our solution....put a lid on it--because shade trees are non-existent where we have electrical outlets.  :)  We actually have a Quest Canopy that is 12 x 12 and it fit up and over the bouncer perfectly.  We also put a tarp under it when we set it up, just to protect from any sticks or sharps we may have missed.  I fully expect this bouncer to last for years....tickled to death to have my skepticism smashed on first usage.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the entrance flap. I think the stitching is not secured well enough to the actual inflatable and is going to become more loose and unreliable.  We can work around it.....but a little effort on manufacturing's quality control end could fix that.  Also there is not enough velcro to secure the flap well.

Glad we<br />did because both boys have had so much fun on it!  Our boys are &#34;rough & tough&#34; like most little boys are, so after weeks of use<br />(we roll it up & store it most of the time) it's &#34;puncture&#34; free & works great!  We originally had it blown up in our basement during Christmas for about a week, but now only use it occasionally outside in our driveway!  We lay a tarp down underneath the bouncer to protect the bottom (although the bouncer has a thick bottom for that purpose anyway) & then connect the fan!  About 1 minute later, &#34;POOF&#34;.... It's playtime!  When it's up & running, my boys are both on it for LONG periods of time throughout the day.  When it's time to &#34;deflate&#34; the fun, it's as easy as turning off the fan, rolling it up & stuffing it into the bag.  The fan & (oversized) bag store easily in our storage room!  It's a one-man job to inflate & deflate too!<br /><br />It's been well-worth the purchase & we are extremely impressed with the sturdiness of this bouncer!",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AFPG34JQ4IOZERYJL4RSHUBC4PAA,1393612612000,0,True

2580,5.0,An Absolute YES!,"I was VERY impressed with this product. Little Tikes has always been a reliable brand as far as quality, durability, design and &#34;playability&#34;. This bouncer is no exception.<br /><br />The material quality was far better than I expected as was the firmness of the bounce area and slide. I actually tried it out myself the day before our party and it was pretty cool. :)<br /><br />Setup and takedown are very easy. Both days I did it by myself. Blows up in about 4 minutes. I couldn't believe it. Deflation takes a bit longer and it helps if you roll across to force the air out.<br /><br />The blower was much quieter than I expected. It wasn't silent but it wasn't distracting at all. Indoors may be different. The blower was also of very good quality and had a GFI plug at the end. An extra that you don't expect but something Little Tikes thought of ahead for safety.<br /><br />I highly suggest you get a tarp to put under the bouncer especially if it is on grass. Also, make sure the tarp extends a few feet beyond the slide or place a blanket or something for the kids to land on so grass and dirt doesn't get into their socks and then tracked into the bouncer.<br /><br />I'm hard to impress but this product deserves more than 5 stars.",[],B003NSBMUI,B08J8P34NR,AGYTRH6IVPEJYR4DT3VWQ7MVGXWA,1505441729455,1,True
