8,5.0,SO MUCH FUN,Bought one for my daughter and one for my husband for Christmas. They LOVE it. It is great for the experienced and for the beginning pilot. The battery life is reasonable and the graphics on the camera are great!. With a tap of a button on the remote you can control the camera and video taking feature. We love seeing the videos they take. Extremely durable. Color coded LED lights make this fun to fly at night. Its a scaled down version of the DJI. Six axis gyros make this very stable.

17,5.0,So incredibly tough and forgiving... not to mention FUN.,"After getting an X12 over Christmas, and having an absolute blast crashing into everything while learning to fly indoors, I decided it was time to see what it was like outside. Flying an X12 outside left something to be desired, so I began researching to figure out what might fit the bill. After reading MANY reviews and watching a ton of videos, I chose the X5c. It fit my budget, and I got the impression that it truly was a great quad to learn on.<br /><br />Well, after only a few short months of owning it I can say with certainty that the X5 has certainly held up its end of the bargain, and then some. I say &#34;X5&#34;, and not X5&#34;c&#34;, because the camera that comes with this thing is pretty lame. The angle (or field of vision, if you prefer) is very narrow. And I don't know if this is simply an issue with Macs, but I had to reformat the SD-card all the time- simply deleting files didn't work. Otherwise, the camera would believe that there wasn't enough space on the card and wouldn't record. So, this made it very easy for me to make the decision to jettison the camera all together, and just let this bird fly free. And I didn't stop there... the feet were no longer necessary either, so away they went too. The prop guards? Never even bothered attaching them to begin with. Flying this thing was kinda fun before getting rid of that stuff, but it became much more fun without the extra baggage.<br /><br />From the beginning, I chose to learn on &#34;advanced mode&#34;, just because it was faster, more responsive, and more challenging. However, I was by no means &#34;advanced&#34; at flying these things. The first time I took it anyplace that wasn't my tiny front yard, I took it to a local park and flew it up kinda high. Well, then I experienced that common thing where you kinda get disoriented with where the quad is in relation to nearby trees, and somehow I flew it into some woods with it impacting the first few branches at around 50 feet. Somehow, by some miracle, the thing didn't get hung up in any of those branches- I'm attributing that to the fact that it was still winter time (not many leaves to help hold it there)... so, where does it ultimately land? Where else, than in a creek? Yup! Brand new lil quad... in the creek. I just took a big deep breath and hung my head when I realized this. Somehow the thing was still on when I fished it out (it never completely submerged- landed in shallow area). I immediately turned it off and removed the battery before shaking it out best I could. Then I brought it home, opened it up, and placed it on the floor about a foot away from a space heater to allow it to dry out for the rest of the day. The next morning, I put everything back together, popped the recharged battery back in, and everything worked perfectly. From then on, I became much more careful about flying at any sort of altitude that included potential trees... and creeks, for that matter. It also didn't take me long to see the need for more batteries. I bought one of the packages available here on Amazon, where it provides you with four batteries and a 4x1 charger to charge them all simultaneously. I also bought to extra batteries before getting the 4x1. So, now that I have 7 batteries, I find myself not only enjoying the thing more, personally, I also have found more time to teach others how to fly it.<br /><br />O, and before I forget... another sad, yet awesome, thing that happened:  I was on my way to go begin my marathon of marathon study sessions for finals when I stopped by at a nearby church to catch about 10 minutes of flight time. I parked in a different area than usual so that I could see what range I could accomplish, and then flew it back with more altitude and speed than I'd intended.... well, I didn't turn fast enough and right behind me was a nice tree waiting to catch the quad. It got stuck at probably 40 feet up. I found various things laying around to throw at it, and even when I hit it with a lightweight block of wood, the thing still didn't budge. I climbed as high as I could, but the branches became too thin and there was no one around to spot me if I fell. Not worth it. So, I just had to let it be. I thought to myself... o well, you need to study anyway. This thing was obviously only meant to be an ill-fated distraction. So I went on my way and decided that I'd re-evaluate the situation only after I'd gotten through at least half of the material I needed to cover. So, a week and several thunderstorms later, I returned to the scene to find the quad stil sitting up in the tree looking all happy. I devised a telescoping &#34;pushstick&#34; made out of an 8' cardboard tube and some quarter round. I tied a rope to it, climbed the tree as high as I could, and then managed to push the quad out of the tree after extending the &#34;pushstick&#34; to a length of almost 20 feet. Took the quad home, opened it up, and it was bone dry and with no signs of rust of weathering. I put it all back together, and it worked. No problems at all. It's amazing.<br /><br />I've crashed this thing into everything except for myself or other people. I've let my dog chase it, and eventually she even got ahold of it. Still, the quad survives. It slammed into a road sign at full speed earlier today. It survives. I've put this thing through tons of punishment, and thus far, the only thing I've needed to replace is two of those tiny cogs/gears at the bottom of the motor (the ones that engage with the larger gears that actually spin the props). These smaller gears seem to have a tendency to slip over time, and then they fall off. I've gotten into the habit of performing a little flight check before each flight, and confirming that those are properly seated seems to have made a big difference. Still, I have extras now. In anticipation of eventually burning out a motor, I also went ahead and purchased an extra CW and CCW motor. The nice thing about the prospect of changing out the motors is that the new ones have a metal gear that seems like it won't slip like the little plastic ones do. I dunno; we'll see.<br /><br />I know I'll eventually destroy this thing, but OMG it blows my mind how much it's been through and is still going strong. I'd post a picture of how beat up it is, but I'm afraid it wouldn't really do it justice. It's scratched all over, one of the props was bent and then reshapaned before getting chewed on by my friend's cat. Still, the quad survives...<br /><br />Once I finally burn out a motor or somehow destroy this thing, I'll update my review to let you know how it goes. Overall, I'm getting a lot of good times out of it. Still learning new ways to enjoy it.

First off, I am a 51 one year old man who does not play video games, so using the remote control is not second nature like it may be for someone who grew up playing video games. It took a little while to learn, about 20 minutes of indoor flying (garage) before I felt comfortable enough to take it out. Once outside this thing really moves and can easily be taken away in the wind. Keep it low at first. It is durable. I have crashed it too many times to count on concrete and the only issue was, I have lost 2 lenses that go over the LED lights.

31,5.0,Great beginner / low budget quadcopter,"We bought the Syma X5C for my 10 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. It's a great entry-level quadcopter. As with anything like this, there is a little bit of a learning curve but any kid with decent hand-eye coordination will be able to pick it up quickly.<br />While it's not indestructible, it is very durable. We've crashed it many times with no damage. One extra set of four propellersis included but we haven't had to use them - yet.<br />One of the greatest features of this quadcopter is that replacement parts are inexpensive and easy to find (and I don't mean just the propellers - virtually every part can be purchased separately). We have had to replace one motor which wasn't difficult - although it did require a little patience and basic soldering skills.<br />Battery life is a limitation. Average flight time on the included 500mAh battery is in the 10 minute range and charge time is in the 90 minute range. I would definitely recommend buying multiple batteries (there is a nice little set of 5 700mAh batteries and gang charger (charges all of them at one time) available here on Amazon - get it.<br />The video from the camera is really pretty good. We enjoy going home and watching the videos from our flights.<br />While it may seem a bit counter-intuitive, if you're going to be flying around trees leave the propeller guards off - they are what tends to get snagged in trees.<br /><br />Overall - this is a great little beginner quadcopter and I can definitely recommend it.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AE3G4WMLG4H4UIBGMI32RO42X7YA,1452040292000,0,True

The video - when the drone is stabilized - is OK but there is no gyro or stabilizer for the camera so do not expect much.<br /><br />If you are looking to fly a drone for the first time this one is great - if you want to dish out extra dough look for drones that have a larger range (100m).",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGKA3B4NH2XYZB5NPMVJJWAORD2Q,1479069339000,4,True

Instructions aren't in precise English, but you can definitely put 2 and 2 together to master the controls.  A bit on the louder side for indoor use, but the price/value is a steal.  Great for use outside, with the lights, camera mode, and high speed mode.  Battery life is rather short at 5-7 mins, but I didn't realize that's really for EVERY drone out there, even the $400 ones.<br /><br />This model seems to be one of the more popular models so there are a bunch of accessories you can get.  The battery it comes with is 500 mah, and I picked up a 4x set of 680 mah for extra flight time and swapping for a solid 30 mins or so of play time.  Supposedly that's the way a lot of hobbyists do it.  I HIGHLY recommend getting extra batteries regardless of what drone you get.

She ran over it, stopped on it, then peeled out on it.  Broke the propellers and did a little more cosmetic damage but after replacing the propellers, was like new again.  Then he flew it into a tree, about 50' in the air.  Using a ladder and several poles that we duct taped together, it took several whacks to free it, no damage at all.  The little guy is so lite, it doesn't damage when it falls to the ground.<br /><br />Couple of notes for you.  Propellers are not all the same.  There's two pairs, both pairs are different and it does matter which way they go on.<br /><br />I about threw the plastic packaging out when I noticed that taped to the bottom was a spare set of propellers (I had bought him a separate spare pair).

Also you need to mark the orientation of the Quadcopter so that when it is high in the sky and a  gust of wind turns it you can swivel it back into the correct orientation and not lose it in the tree's.

113,4.0,Great little starter drone,"The Syma X5C 2.4G quadracopter comes with everything you need to get you started straight out of the box except for 4x AA batteries required for the remote.<br /><br />In the box you get the quadracopter itself, 2 pairs of rotor guards, a spare set of rotors, battery for the copter, USB charger, small screwdriver, 2Gb Micro SD card and even a micro SD to USB converter.<br /><br />The first thing you'll note about it is that everything is cheap. The USB charger is basically some wires connected to USB socket.  The micro SD to USB converter is just a small piece of plastic etc. The camera uses about a 10 year old sensor.<br /><br />The battery fits in a small slot on top of the camera.  You simply pull the camera forward to get to the battery compartment.  Unhook the battery which is connected to the copter via a small 2 wire connector (note, do not pull on the wires to disconnect the battery as you will end up pulling the wires out from the connector) and plug it into the USB charger and wait.  It takes approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes to charge the battery and this will give you roughly 6 minutes of flight time.<br /><br />The X5C is very light and unlike more expensive and heavier drones doesn't have things like a hover mode or a return to base function.  One of the first things you should do is fit the rotor guards (these simply screw into slots next to the rotor mountings with the included screwdriver).  You will need these as you will end up crashing this copter.<br /><br />I would suggest flying the copter in a basement or similar place where there is no wind to get used to the controls.  The remote is geared for when the camera is facing towards you.  So left, right, rotate, forward, backwards etc. is setup to where the camera is pointing.  If the camera is pointing away from you controls are effectively reversed as you look at it.  One handy feature, if you can't see the camera is that the drone comes with four lights.  Two orange on the front and two green on the back.  The two orange lights are where the camera is and therefore makes it easy to figure out what remote inputs are required.  This is especially handy once you get outdoors and the copter becomes small enough that you cannot really see the camera itself.  One of the things you will want to do is practice hovering as this doesn't come with an auto hover feature.  Once you have that down then take it outside.  The reason I say this is that this copter is so light that it doesn't take much for the wind to effect its flight path and characteristics.  Even on an apparently calm day, when the copter is 50ft to 100ft off the ground, chances are you will encounter some wind which will effect the copter so learning to control it first in a windless environment is a plus.<br /><br />After attaching the battery and powering on the copter and the remote, you move the left controller all the way forward and backwards to pair the controller with the copter.  When you start to rise you will notice the copter drifting, usually either left or right but sometimes also forward or backwards.  Luckily on the remote are some trim buttons so that you dial the drift down a minimum.  I've not been able to completely null out the trim but its fairly easy to get it to a point where its nearly stable and easy to control.<br /><br />On your first few flights you will crash the X5C until you get used to the controls. The X5C is fairly flexible and will survive a good few crashes without harm.  One thing to note however is that when flying and the battery runs out, you effectively lose all control of the copter so make sure when getting to that point that you are not a couple of hundred feet off the ground and far away (it has a range of roughly 300ft and will rise to approximately 200ft although I've not had it that high yet).  The battery lasts roughly 5-6 minutes depending on how heavily you are controlling it so try to time it that when you get close to the 5 minute mark you are bringing the copter back down and close to yourself for recovery.<br /><br />One thing you will want to invest in is extra batteries and chargers.  You can pick up a charger that will charge up to 5 batteries at once and extra higher capacity batteries on Amazon Prime that fit the X5C.  After all, when you wait for over an hour to charge a battery, drive someplace to fly it then only have about 5 minutes of flight time, it is not so much fun.<br /><br />The camera quality is quite poor.  It will record 720p video but the still shots are woefully lacking (I think they are 2MP).  I would suggest recording video and if you want a still, simply select a frame from your video as the single shots come out quite fuzzy.<br /><br />Overall the X5C is really just a toy but it is a very fun toy.  If you are thinking about getting a more expensive drone like the DJI Phantom then this is a great place to start learning how to fly it.  Even if you are not wanting a more expensive drone, this is a fun little toy.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEB5R4AU3242FXZFI6LJWQMYHKXA,1449504949000,1,True

115,5.0,Great Beginner Quadcopter - Can Be Used For FPV,"I'm not a quadcopter expert by any means, but I have flown a number of different models. The Syma X5C-1 is the best handling and easiest to fly of any of the entry level quadcopters I have flown. I like the UDI U818A and have three. They are fun to fly, forgiving, and have survived many crashes. However, since I bought the Symas, I now have two X5C-1s, I rarely fly the U818A. The X5C-1 is more stable, easier to hover, handles the wind better, and can survive some rough treatment. It will carry an 808 Keychain camera if you want upgraded video, but will not fly well with a Mobius or anything heaver. With a little practice, it can be flown inside or out.<br /><br />It can be equipped for first person view. I recently mounted a Spektrum Ultra Micro FPV Camera & VTX (SPMVA1100) atop one of my X5C-1s and I'm getting some great FPV video through a remote monitor I mounted atop the Syma transmitter.

I wasn't sure how much we'd like flying a drone so didn't want to start off with something expensive. I purchased this drone because it had the best combination of review scores and price on Amazon. It also seemed to be fairly popular, high volume of sales, which means replacement parts would likely be easily available. So far, we both really enjoy the drone. It didn't take long to figure out the basics, but we still need plenty of practice. Now that we have it, I wonder if the model with headless functionality would have been a better move. It can be difficult to know which direction the drone is flying, so that can make it hard to fly it in the direction you'd like to. Hard to complain given the price.

However I choose this one because of the price and the availability of replacement parts.  It is a guarantee that I would crash this so we would need to be able to fix it.  Well I have crashed it and gotten it stuck in trees, everyday since we got it,  and so far it had taken my abuse. Additionally the photos and videos are much more clear and bright than I would have expected. We have so much fun with it!

143,5.0,Excellent fathers day gift! Excellent Quadcopter for the price. Easy to fly Indoors/Outdoors.,"I absolutely Love this Quadcopter. This would be my first to own, but not my first to fly. Im an avid RC &#34;whatever&#34; individual and I was quite happy with the value for the dollar on this.<br /><br />So here's my details<br />Pros:<br />Easy to fly<br />VERY crash-damage Resistant<br />Lots of parts available<br />Camera is rather decent<br />Control sensitivity, trim, and modes are very good<br />My Flight time averages 7-10 minutes as long as Im not trying to fly extremely high or fast.  A controlled indoor flight is more towards 10, Outdoor more towards 7.  This is on the stock battery that came with the unit<br />Charge time is approx. 45 minutes to 75 minutes. I use the USB port on my Surface Tablet's brick and that does a nice job.  Also my ASUS tablet wall wart USB port charger works just as well. (I believe these are both 2.1 amp)<br />Outdoor wind control - under 10 mph and you can &#34;battle&#34; it..  if you are a Newbie,  Keep it low while you learn and cut altitude thrust if needed so it does not get carried away.<br /><br />Cons:<br />would like the movement sensors to be a bit faster to respond.<br />the controller has a bit too much &#34;fake&#34; to it.  The LCD is nice to see where your trim ammounts are, what mode you are in, and if you are in Low or high power mode, but the Fake plastic buttons and nav pad just make it a bummer when you get it out of the box.<br />The Range... SUCKS.. however the mod to use a router antenna works fantastic and takes just a few minutes to do.<br />The default action of the software to repeat the last command when it goes out of range also sucks.  If it performed the same action as &#34;low battery&#34; it would be allright but if you are fighting the wind at say 75 feet up and you sideways drift say 30 feet and it goes out of range, it will just keep going..and going.. If the wind gust stops and you were at full power with a forward tilt, and a fresh battery, Forget it. its gone.  I would imagine it would go for miles before you saw it again. Might be faster just to buy a new one :)<br />Lastly, Hovering is not an exact science. It can not anticipate thrust changes due to the height off the ground so if you are hovering in your living room and fly over your carpet and transition to flying over the couch, the amount of thrust required to maintain horizontal level flight changes so you need to react to it with slight adjustments.<br /><br />A Few Nifty Things about this that I feel was missing when I bought it:<br />1. Explanation on the modes.  The modes change what stick does the head rotation and what stick does the sideways movement (a Strafe if you will).  Mode 1 which is out of the box, has the rotation on the left stick along with Up/down thrust control.  The Right stick handles forward/backwards and the &#34;strafing&#34; left to right.  Mode 2 puts the strafing on the Left stick and moves the turning of the head on the right stick.  This feels more like flying a rc airplane than a copter.  you can move forward and steer left and right with just one stick on mode 2.  Its a personal preference thing<br />2. High and low power mode.  Low power indoors, High power outdoors.  the High power really increases the aggressiveness of the steering but did not do much for overall lift.  High power saved my bacon when I was flying it outdoors and a wind gust caught it and almost took it..<br /><br />Overall, Just a fun little copter to fly!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEM3MI4MGSWQRI7ILGTNVVRZPIEQ,1465578155000,2,True

147,5.0,Exceeds all expectations.,"This thing is an amazing value!  I have a lot fixed wing RC experience and took an interest in teaching myself how to fly and shoot video and photos with a drone.  I am used to spending hundreds on RC, but thought I'd take a shot with the X5C because I figured there would be a lot of crashing and bashing going on and I didn't want to beat up an expensive piece of technology.  So, I didn't expect much. I was wrong.  This thing flies like a champ right out of the box.  Again, I have a lot of experience with RC, so I was already familiar with trims, orientation, etc....but I never dreamed I'd be shooting video and accurate aerial photos by the 3rd flight out of the box.  Sure, it seems flimsy, but remember it is important to keep weight to a minimum.  At first blush, the transmitter looks toyish, but it functions perfectly and is great for learning controls, orientation, etc.  I recommend buying a few extra batteries with a multi-charger as well. Once you start messing with this thing you won't want to stop.  Great fun and easy to fly....exceeds expectations for the price.  Truly a great value.  Check it the video I captured and put together with about 10 minutes of work.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEQYTQ3YPQTFJZHE6DIIULZXWSRA,1466992077000,0,True
148,3.0,Disappointing Syma Motors and Quality Control,"I have been a long time fan of Syma products with around seven different helis etc. I bought this on a one-day special (arrived Dec 9th) and it was great fun, stable and easy to fly with High and Low speed options for novices. This thing can be fast and get away far enough it is hard to see which direction it is heading. So, I have spent quite a lot of time in the scrub looking for the downed quad. All but TWO times that was my fault for losing a clear sight of it.<br /><br />Now to the two missing stars for this review. The first time I lost it, it headed off and would not respond to controls even though it was still well within radio range. It dipped on one corner and sadly, that dipped corner was away from me so off it went. I pulled off power but it ignored any and all control input. My guess is the flight controller software was trying to get it back up level before managing another command so the drop to ground was queqed and thus ignored. Syma has built into the flight controller for it to quickly go to ground about three seconds after it loses radio contact so that probably saved me an even longer walk when it over-rode the command queue.<br /><br />On recovery, one CCW motor was running at about half-speed and that was the dropped-corner that dictated the fly-away direction at that time. I figured it would be quicker and easier to just buy some motors so got a four-pack, 2 x CW and 2 x CCW for about 9-bucks (arrived about Dec 9th) . I am a retired Engineer so being anal about things, I used a sharpie to write numbers on the top and bottom of frame halves, the propellers and also indicators inside for the orientation of all four sets of motor wires so I wouldn't get it wrong soldering the new motor back in.<br /><br />It took about an hour to get it apart, install the motor and get it flying again, but it was perfect and good to have it back flying. Two days later another fly away. On retrieval the same issue, one motor barely turning. When I pulled it apart it was the other CCW motor running at about half speed. I will solder the replacement in today.<br /><br />I  have to say I am REALLY disappointed with Syma as I now have used the two CCW motors I bought and have no spares, so I guess I have to shell out another 9-bucks so that I have two CCW spares in case I crash it.<br /><br />One motor going out is understandable, but not TWO in such a short time and NOT BOTH CCW motors. Obviously a quality control thing, I am guessing. This is annoying as I was so happy with the X5C I intended to buy an X8C, but now not so sure of Syma products.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEP3OCB45UHUWVHQFK6HBMNGNLIA,1450883792000,4,True

150,4.0,Great fun given some TLC,"I have a lot of fun with the quad. I think you can really get a lot out of it if you take the time to read several blogs and watch some YouTube videos.<br />There are many tweaks that can be done to improve the flying experience. To prevent fires, etc. I highly recommend getting a quality charger like those made by Hitec. It is just as important to know how to care and store the batteries(with a 50% charge) as it is to know how to charge them.<br />LiPo batteries are very sensitive to charging rates and other conditions.<br />Also buy quality batteries. don't cheap out on anything so critical.<br />As far as motors, these are cheap motors and can burn up in an instant if the props are blocked from turning freely. Make sure to go to full down throttle to cut the motors if you run into any problem like the craft is not flying properly or it brushed a tree, etc. that may have jammed a prop but it is flying too high to see what happened. If anything is not normal, cutting the throttle should be the first thing to do. Let is fall if it has to, the body can take some abuse, within reason. And assuming you are not flying over hard ground.<br />Don't expect too much at one time. Learn how to fly it smoothly and with fully charged batteries at the start and if you have disassembled it before make sure all the tiny screws are in place and fully tightened. This can be a little time consuming but ensuring the body is assembled properly so there are no loose parts or gaps where the parts come together is essential. This is an inexpensive model to enjoy and to learn from before investing into something more sophisticated and expensive. Learn from your mistakes on this one first. :)<br /><br />If you are beginners,  I strongly recommend tying a string or light wire to the bottom and the other end to something solid or a weight, like a small wrench, a stapler, etc. The little motors will not have enough power to overcome the additional weight. Now you can practice what all the controls do without worrying about it going out of control, hitting walls, etc. etc.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AG2JJJ2S7MDAFEXI64VKXDG6Y2CA,1464184179000,1,False

188,3.0,One motor had problems right out of the box.,"So I bought this drone to use with my cleaning business to take before and after videos. Unboxing was a typical experience, with minimal parts. I assembled the blade guards, hooked up the battery and voila she’s ready to fly.<br /><br />Except the remote needed 4 AA batteries that were not included. This is important if you want to give this as gift and want them to use it right away.<br /><br />Now, the battery came with enough charge for one full session of flying. The instruction manual says you should charge the battery for 75 minutes for a whole 7 minutes of flying time. Ouch. That’s kinda crummy.<br /><br />On first flight the drone takes off... and immediately starts going side ways by itself. Whiskey tango foxtrot. I play around with the adjustments on the remote but I’m getting no where. After about 10 minutes of launching, crashing, flipping and cussing at the drone the battery is drained and needs another recharge.<br /><br />This gives me time to inspect the drone and see if there any mechanical issue with it. I spin each blade and find that one of them isn’t spinning freely. At the full rotation it stops, or catches, and requires a little force to move again. I found the culprit. I added a drop of oil to the assembly in hopes that it would fix the issue but it didn’t.<br /><br />Undeterred I stuck it out and tried to fly the drone again and adjust the controls as much as possible.<br /><br />With a sticking motor this drone just isn’t predictable. Vertical height is affected due to the motor playing catch up, horizontal travel is constant, and forget about maintaining height.<br /><br />Overall, the construction of the unit is good for the price, the flying experience (although affected by the faulty motor) was great, and if the motor weren’t damaged I would have kept the drone. It’s in a box waiting for a return to amazon. 3 stars.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFUO2MQU4K2KJJUT232LAI73AYMQ,1514033560071,0,False

Lost one in a very tall tree when we inexplicably lost control of it on a windy day (so beware folks, try not to fly it too close to things it can get stuck in that you can't reach). Bought another one because we loved it so much. It's hard to imagine how a drone that's so inexpensive also does video and pretty decent video at that.

212,5.0,Great Quad Copter for the Money,"My wife gave me this quad for Christmas.  Controlling the quad takes some practice but after half a dozen flights I've become pretty good at it.  The thing to remember is take it slow, and fly it in an open area the first few times so you can get the hang of it.  Flight duration is between 6 and 8 minutes depending on the camera operation so extra batteries are a plus.  Video quality from the camera is ok, it's a 2 MP so don't expect hi-def video.  I think a lot of the negative reviews are caused by people who have unrealistic expectations of what a $50 quad can do.  There's no flight automation, it doesn't come home when it looses connection with the controller, nor is it position stabilized so it tends to drift around. Also, when the battery gets low, the running lights flash a few times and then the motors shut off.  That can be a problem if it's a 150 feet up over trees.  Because it's so light, when the motors shut off it just sort of falls slowly to the ground, not a big deal unless it's over trees or water.  Also, because it's light, and not particularity powerful.  It's fairly susceptible to wind, if the winds are over 8-10 MPH it can be blown away.  I don't consider this thing an &#34;inside&#34; toy.  It's got four blades spinning hella fast and can break things it hits.  Keep your fingers AWAY from the blades, they aren't sharp but as fast as they spin, they don't need to be to open you up.  Get it outside in an open area, get it 20 or 30 feet up and have fun!  It's light, and pretty durable most of my landings have been semi controlled crashes and the quad is none the worse for it.

217,1.0,Drowning Drone,"I was so excited to finally play with my own quad-copter. After watching them online for many months I came across this one at a fantastic deal! I quickly ordered it and it arrived very quickly. The Amazon box was in good condition, but the box the Syma came in was already opened, the drone already assembled with loose parts in the box, and it was dirty!<br /><br />I quickly forgave that if the drone were to work, however after charging it and playing around inside I couldn't get it to fly straight up. I recharged it and took it out again the next morning after reading directions even more carefully to make fine corrections. The corrections do NOT work and the drone immediately took off in any given direction based on which way I started it. Left, right, forward, and reverse corrections did absolutely nothing. To make it even worse, the drone was already halfway into the neighbors yard before I even started with the corrections. I tried every single possible orientation vs correction factor and came out at a loss. This quad-copter definitely moves, and the camera worked fine, I think. Mine came with a 4GB microSD card. I even bought a 32GB card, spare batteries and a charger. What a waste of money that was. From reviews, I most likely got a dud or a fake. The directions are even in very incorrect English with poor grammar!<br />I've attached a single portion of one page to show you this.

220,5.0,No reason not to get this,This is my first flying anything and I will say that it's easier than I thought. I can get a little excited and end up shooting off the wrong way but it's durable so if all else fails I just cut the throttle and let it crash. No problem with it holding up. It's so light that it falls softly even from 50ft. I'm not a young man so my reflexes are not that of my 20 year old son who has no problems flying it at all. With the mic on the camera you can hear it quit when it gets too high out of range but as it falls back into range it picks right back up. I'm amazed with the camera. How HD has become so dirt cheap so fast is incredible I think. Don't hesitate to get this for this price.

The camera works well for both photos and videos. You will need to take a few until you get used to the angle of the camera. 360 function works great and makes you feel like a pro. I do wish the batteries lasted longer but 7-10 mins actually feels like a long time. It is surprisingly resilient as well...ran it into a tree on my first flight at full speed and it still flew right as rain after dusting it off.

226,5.0,Best quad copter for under $50!,"Wow, this is honestly the best quadcopter for under $50! I've had multiple Hubsan drones or quadcopters and they break way to easily! This is the best drone for beginners, as it can record video, do flips, and has a pretty decent controller and range. The Battery time is pretty good: 7 minutes with prop guards and around 10-11 without. The charge time is about an hour with an iPhone/Usb wall adapter since wall chargers are 500mah out (every our) and the battery is 500mah. If you are not sure when charging is done, a helpful LED indicator on the charger will turn off. The quadcopter seems big but is really light as it weighs under 2 pounds, and because of that, high falls don't damage the quadcopter. I've had mine fall out of the air from a very high up altitude and no visible damage, so I pushed throttle and started flying again! So, all in all, this is the best quadcopter for under $50 or even $100 for beginners!

234,4.0,Neat little drone.,"I am new to the world of RC drones. I read and did my homework on them and a lot of stuff I read and saw in reviews said for the newbie who is (as Pink Floyd says in a song) Learning To Fly, this was the best drone to learn with due to its cost and durability. My brother got an X5C for Christmas and he brought his in so I could see it in person. He did an indoor demo flight so I could see it in action and I was impressed. I decided to buy one of my own.<br /><br />  When it arrived I hadn't read the sellers description closely where it stated &#34;note: does not include a micro sad card&#34; and was not pleased. I had even reboxed it and started a return then saw those cards are very inexpensive and I wasn't really buying this for the cam. This is to play with and learn to pilot so I can eventually move up to a good FPV equipped drone. I decided I'd go ahead and keep it because I can always get that card anytime. Amazon was very helpful when I called to cancel the return.<br /><br />  Once I unboxrd it and read through the poorly written broken English instruction manual it was time to charge the batteries and get this bird in flight. Binding the copter with the controller is easy. Power on the controller, set the copter on a level surface and turn on the power on the copter and when the lights go from a rapid pulse to a slower blink move the left stick up til you hear a beep then all the way down. The controller beeps again and the lights on the copter burn steady. The copter will now respond to the controller commands. I've flown.....and wrecked a few of those 20 dollar Costco sphere type copters which really were hard to control for a newbie. Those spheres use an infrared type control so you need to keep the controller pointed at the aircraft at all times or it loses control and goes amuck and 9 times out of ten results in its demise. The controls for this drone have a totally different feel. You have a lot more precise control over the aircraft since I was indoors I was trying out hovering and simple movements. My suggestion for the beginner is find a large indoor area to get used to the drone's movements and controls.<br /><br />  All in all I like this drone. If you are looking for a good quality and durable drone this is perfect learning quad for the cost. I took off a star for the ad card not being included but that's nothing big. I'm happy with it. Can't wait to try outdoor flying.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AERQAPXWDVCKPB4NTJNUUVLISNQA,1456480253000,0,True

256,5.0,Awesome Toy and Picture Taker,This is the best starting out Quadcopter.  What you get for the money is amazing. This is my 2nd one in less than a month.  It was very easy to learn how to fly.  I did practice touch and go's in my living room.  Learning how to control it etc... I took it outside and flew it very carefully for several days in a row.  It took great photos and video.  I had no complaints.  It has 2 red lights in the front and 2 green in the back.  You have to make sure that you know which direction the drone is pointed and keep it in that direction or your controls end up backwards.  Flying it in the daytime was very easy.  I wanted to see those lights at night ad decided to try it at night.  I somehow got it turned around and it took off in the wind after I achieved an altitude of at least 200-300 feet.  I lost it in a pasture heavily dense with trees and rattle snakes.  I looked but could not find it.<br /> Since then I bought one of those key finders that I attached to the bottom and you can find it with a beep of about 80 feet or so.

260,5.0,Most fun toy ever,"This thing is a lot of fun to learn and fly.  Its enough of a challenge to be interesting, yet easy enough to fly to be fun.<br />Having spare batteries makes the learning process go quicker because you don't have to wait 2 hours for the original battery to recharge before flying again.  I get 5 to 7 minutes with the original 500 mAh battery and 8 to 9 minutes from the spare 600 mAh batteries.  The batteries recharge in 90 to 120 minutes.  A faster charger might reduce recharging times.<br /><br />When I got the quad I took off the camera because I've seen youtube videos and the recording showed mostly the ground and hardly any of the horizon.  There's a way to point the camera more horizontally and I'll eventually do that with mine.<br /><br />The quad flies nice and stable, is easy to trim if there's no breeze and takes crashes and keeps ticking.<br />It has 2 sensitivity levels.  Some might call one beginner level and the other expert level.  The button for changing the setting is the silver one at the upper left of the radio.  The operator is notified that the change took place by a quiet little beep.  I can hear it OK because i have good hearing.<br />As a beginner its hard to fly in a wind of 10+ MPH.  The best I can do is to fly straight into a strong wind and then let the breeze blow the quad back toward me.  That might not sound like much fun, but its a good way to get accuston to the radio controils.  Setting the skill level button so the quad  goes to the expert position allows much better flying when the wind blows.<br /><br />After flying a few weeks I'm gaining the ability to keep orientation better and its getting to the point its almost second nature to steer the quad.  I've even enjoyed flying at night a few times.  Whether doing flights at night or in full daylight its a lot better at first to keep the quad as close as possible.  Its really easy to quickly let the wind get the quad too far away when the wind is 10+ mph.<br /><br />I've found that rather than trying to regain control after losing my orientation its working a lot better to cut power and let the quad hit the ground.  The quad will be taken really high really quickly in a strong wind when the quad is set to beginner mode, but changing to expert level can help overcome the wind and help keep the quad from being taken really high too quickly.  The thing is light and really durable, so its better to crash it to the ground than to lose control and hang up in a tree.  There's times I didn't do that and the wind carried it into the trees where it hung up for anywhere from several hours to 2 to 3 days before I could get it down.  Its so light weight that the wind can carry it away very quickly.  But at the same time its light weight makes it real easy to fly when there's little breeze.<br /><br />I learned the basics of the controls with the prop guards installed, but believing the prop guards are partly responsible for making the quad a lot harder to recover from trees I removed the prop guards.<br /><br />The digital readout on the radio works, but its more of a distraction than useful and is better left unwatched.  The radio batteries outlast the quad batteries by at least 10 times.<br /><br />I've let it get out of range a few times because of the wind.  When out of range it takes the quad 3 or 4 seconds to cut power, so when you think you're going too far and you're not in complete control cut power to prevent losing the quad.  Range is a few hundred feet.  By my reckoning that's plenty far enough because as it gets further away it gets too small to see.<br /><br />I like to fly in a 40 acre field because I can stand in the middle and have room to fly, to try to regain control if I lose it and to let the quad drop to the ground before it gets into trees.<br /><br />One thing I was a bit slow to learn is that when I put in a fresh battery and fly again immediately its easy to forget that the quad will have a LOT more power and respond faster.  That means it will get too high too quick in the wind.<br /><br />Important parts are available to order and they seem to be priced reasonably.  I wish the reciever and other electronics were available so I could experiment putting something together with a scratch built frame.<br /><br />Would I buy this again.

293,5.0,Worth Every Penny If You Fly Responsibly,"First off, this product arrived on time and undamaged.<br /><br />Overall Impression:<br />This Quadcopter is a great little R/C &#34;toy&#34; for it's price.<br /><br />History (What I Use It For):<br />I bought this product for my father (a retired pilot) who has Parkinson's Disease and Heart complications (replaced aortic valve, etc), so you can imagine he is not the most mobile or coordinated anymore. However, that being stated, he has no problem flying this in our fields.  My reasoning for buying him this product is that he use to be heavily into R/C flying and had a workshop specifically built for building planes (both R/C and real planes).  Before his health started to fade, he flew his R/C planes daily (weather permitting of course) and frequently built models for local clubs and aviation museums. However, after his first surgery, he no longer was able to accurately fly and he sold all of his planes (which you could tell broke his heart).  Recently, I found this product and thought, what the heck, it seems stable…and indeed it is if there is no wind and the trim is adjusted properly.  He was originally opposed to trying it, since he feared crashing it via his health symptoms, but after I finally made him take the controls, he fell in love with it.  You could see the spark reignite his R/C aviation flame.  As such, for the price, it is a wonderful and stable product.  To top it off, I pressed the down button for him to record his flight and he was very impressed to see the farm from such a vantage point later on the computer.  He always wanted to do that with his R/C planes, but never got around to it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) This Quad is very stable in calm winds (no wind is best) and with proper trims set, which is easy to do (check your manual).<br />2) Very light weight and the blades have a protective guard to reduce injury potentials.<br />3) Flies accurately with good control handling.<br />4) LED lights aid in dawn and dusk flights in terms of directionality (not so much during the daylight though).<br />5) Comes with propeller blade replacements in case of damage (4 total).<br />6) The camera is actually quite good in daylight conditions, not excellent, but still impressive. Not worth attempting though in darker conditions.<br />7) Decent Battery Life.  The Quadcopter's internal battery, which you charge via USB connections (unless you buy a different adapter which we didn't), lasts about 7-14 minutes pending the amount of torture you put it through (attitudes, speed variations, maneuvers, camera utilization, winds you are fighting, etc).<br />8) Accessories are easy to come buy.  I also bought, separately of course, four extra batteries, an extra 4 USB battery charger (buy one, you won't regret it), spare parts, and a carrying case with foam inserts specifically fit for it.  Since I wanted a tighter fit for the chargers, batteries, and spare parts, I simply heated a screwdriver tip with a lighter and then melted smooth segments in the foam case to fit each piece perfectly (be care if you decide to do this and do it in a well ventilated area).  Now my father has everything he needs in one light weight case... which is ideal.<br />9) The batteries recharge quickly, about 60 minutes total with both chargers in use (the single one it came with and the extra one I bought with four charger docks).  If you choose to buy a separate 4 battery charger like we did, you can spend your day flying the Quad longer with all 5 batteries (the one it comes with and the four separate dock one we bought extra), and then have them all recharge again in about an hour to go out flying again.  It averages out to be about 35-70 minutes of flight time (usage dependent according to each battery's specs.) to only one hour of charge time.  We personally average about 60 minutes each time we went out (with all five batteries) with a one hour charge duration.  I assume if you so desired, you could bring a computer along and charge during flights too, but I wouldn't recommend it since the little motors should have some time to cool down between flights (to extend their life and not burn them out).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) It is difficult identifying directionality when it gets further away or higher in elevation.  As you can imagine, since it is completely symmetrical, any directional cues vanish as it travels any distance.  It does have LED lights to show directionality, which is great at dusk and/or dawn flights, but the lights are not clearly visible in daylight.  It takes some practice to learn and might have been better if the product had been painted in two separate bright colors to easily address such a concern.  However, for the price, that is truly not a flaw of the product, just personal preference.<br />2) The Quad can be touchy in terms of synchronizing with the controller.  Basically, make sure the Quad is level when starting of, otherwise, it tends to just blink like crazy (from the LEDs) and does nothing.  This is once again not a true product issue, but a personal method we had to learn.  Also, if the Quad starts drifting abnormally in flight where the trim isn't helping (and wind is not the issue), just land it, turn both it and the controller off, then turn them back on and re-sync it again.  It took us a bit of time to figure that out, but it is not so difficult with practice. This is a product issue that more expensive Quads usually don't have, but for the price, it really isn't an issue.<br /><br />Special Safety Notes:<br />1) PLEASE fly responsibly.  Even though this Quad is an inexpensive &#34;toy,&#34; its blades can cut you our injury spectators.<br />2) Keep all spectators at a safe distance.<br />3) Only fly this in an open area.  Since this product is so light, the higher you go, the more the wind picks up and carries it away.  Therefore, make sure you have enough space to account for that incase it is not powerful enough to deal with it.  For example, we have a few large fields with neighboring tree lines.  During one particular flight, when the Quad flew above the tree line height, the winds increased drastically.  So much that in 5 seconds the quad drifted 500 yards in the opposite direct we were flying it with the controls peaked.  This is important to consider since we had very little wind in the field region itself. It was only when we reach higher altitudes when the winds picked up (in that particular case).  Therefore, if we had not had enough land to safety bring it down, it might have crashed.  If you were not flying in a safe region and the same thing happened, you too might have crashed and/or injured someone if the reception was ever lost (via distance).<br />4) Anyone new to flying should not fly this indoors nor at any extreme heights until you learn how to fly it fluently.  Once again, directionality becomes and issue since it is painted one white tone and since it is so symmetrical.  As such, unless the lighting is dim enough to see the LEDs, it might prove difficult for a newbie to know what direction they are flying before it becomes too late.<br />5) Before Flying The Quad to maximum heights and in ruff conditions, you should always break-in any R/C motors.  I do not know if they already do this in the factory prior to delivery for this model, but a safe bet is to spend one battery spinning the propellers at slower speeds to break-in the motors.  It is too simple of a process not to do if it means not burning out your motors on their initial flight.<br />6) Have Fun, just be smart doing it.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />This product is worth every penny and was able to re-spark an elderly man's old passion for R/C aviation.  I fully recommend this product to any R/C hobbits, both veterans to the hobby and/or newbies, who have the common sense to fly this safely and responsibly.  It is truly a blast to fly.<br /><br />I've included 3 photos to present the camera's quality: One of a deer in a field during the onset of dusk, and 2 just above the same field's tree line during the day.<br /><br />I hope this review helps.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612I4qlftqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612I4qlftqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612I4qlftqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7156HqpbFLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7156HqpbFLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7156HqpbFLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xQy-S+dvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xQy-S+dvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xQy-S+dvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGOQ7WKCXW6SJW6ZZDA4BADYA4KQ,1433963205000,937,True

So I gave it to him (he was thrilled!) and bought another one for me.  I did much better after watching him and watching several videos on YouTube.  Then I want to visit my other younger grandchildren, and while they couldn't fly it, they had fun watching it.  So I gave it to my son (their father).  He loved it.  So I bought another one, and did even better.  So I have gotten it down pretty well, but flew it at night and it ran into a tree, so I have to replace one of the engines.  I bought the repair kit, so I'm going to fix it this weekend.  Also the kit had a couple of extra batteries.  They don't last more than 6 minutes, so I make sure that all three of mine are charged before going out for a flight.<br /><br />The only thing you have to watch out for is over-compensating with the controls.

329,5.0,Surpisingly fun for such a cheap item.  A good test of coordination.,"I gave it five stars because it's a cheap quadcopter with a camera.  It's fun to operate, and not too hard once you get the hang of it.  The camera is not super-high quality and takes grainy video (AVI- huge files) in low light.  But it came with a 4GB SD card.  I was surprised at that.  Also included are 4 spare rotor blades and 4 bumpers, a charging cable, and a small Phillips screwdriver to remove the battery cover on the remote.  Not included are the 4 AA batteries needed for the remote.<br /><br />I learned to hover (indoors) just before the battery went low.  It takes a fine touch, and Newton's first law of motion, and second are demonstrated quite readily.  What I learned is that when this thing is moving forward, backward or sideways, it continues, even with the direction control in the center, until you null it out with some (very very brief) opposite input.  So if you start it moving forward (in the direction of the red lights on it), it will continue until you put in some backward tilt, just for 100mSec or so to provide an opposing force.  Trying to move the controls smoothly doesn't do it, except to begin a maneuver.  Then a sudden input in the opposite direction is needed to stop.<br /><br />Still photos are even worse than the video in low light.  Probably fine in the daylight...  We'll soon see.<br /><br />The manual takes some interpretation.  It was evidently translated from Chinese.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFFGHLLKH4MPP5QGEDI7C5CIHVDQ,1526354144100,3,True

333,5.0,The Ultimate Drone! I Can Not Recommend Highly Enough!!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend in hopes that it would be better than the several other drones that I have bought him the past several Christmases. As it turns out it is totally much better in all aspect than any other drone I have given him and i have given him about 6 over the years. The protective guards around the propellers help them to last longer so it is not as frustrating when you have to go through so many propellers in a short amount of time when it takes weeks for the replacements to arrive from overseas. The HD camera works like a charm and shoots very clear video, it is not bouncy, not grainy or cloudy. Two weeks after Christmas we were up the road at a small park above our home in Atlanta, GA and he was flying is really high, it goes really high up and you can get awesome video from above the treeline. Well, the wind blew and caught it and blew it into a tree about 60 feet up from the ground. There was nothing we could do except stand there and stare at it willing it to come down like two stupid dogs. Of course people as the obligatory stupid question, &#34;did you get it stuck in the tree&#34;? No dummy, we landed it there to load passengers!. So, we left and were a bit sad because we just knew that if it came down someone would immediately pounce on it and say &#34;oh, look a drone, a free drone&#34;. From tine to time we would go by and see if it was still in the tree and it still was. We stopped going after a week or so because some really heavy rains, wind and cold moved in and we figured that it if it fell it would not be there in the first place and if it was it would not work after 6 inches of rain. Well, one evening about 4 weeks after he got it stuck in the tree we just decided to go check to see if it was still in the tree. It was dusk and we could tell that it was no longer in the tree. We looked around on the ground and then at one another, made sad faces and said, &#34;well, it's gone&#34; and turned to walk back to our truck. I decided to look a little further around the concrete wall that surrounds the walkway and I saw something strange sitting on the top of the concrete wall. I looked hard, walked forward real quick and shouted to my partner&#34;here it is!, it's here&#34;. You would think I had found a mountain of gold!! He came over and said &#34;wow, i can't believe that it's still here&#34;! It was wet and a little muddy, i shook it off and we took it home. we were certain that it would not work after being in all the rain. my partner put it in the sun to dry out, charged the battery and when it was charged, it flew like it did when it was flown the first time! i was totally amazed!

My brother has a gopro, and puts together a lot of HD videos for different groups that he is a part of, so we didn't expect this camera to be very good.  However, to our surprise, the camera was way better than we expected. We flew the drone at a high altitude around our neighbourhood, plugged it in the laptop and the recording was awesome! We saw the our house, our yard, it was really cool.  The battery life is great, it flies high, it flies outside, and inside.  It's easy to use! YOU SHOULD BUY IT!!! My friends all bought drones for Christmas.. my brother's is better... and i'm not just saying that.. It was very evident that the quality of this was higher.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHUZDBOIXBD6IJPOBYL4JSY5PNUQ,1455503358000,1,True

It comes with a spare set of propellers and I bought an extra set and so far have not had a need for any of them.

377,5.0,great with extra batteries,"To follow is a review written by my son:<br />I am 12 years old and my dad purchased 2 drones and extra batteries for me and my siblings for Christmas. We love them and it’s hard not to go outside in the freezing weather and play with these drones!<br /><br />This drone is absolutely great! You can replace almost every piece of it; even if you break the motherboard you can replace it. It flies very smoothly and is really easy to get the hang of flying. There are lots of controls to mess with like flips and trimming. this is a way to perfect your drone if it is tilting/flying. in a direction even when you're not pressing the controls. There is a high and low speed for flying i would recommend not using the fast speed if you are just starting to fly because it’s very hard to control. Another great feature of this drone is that when the battery goes dead it doesn't just fall from the sky; it slowly decelerates to the ground, then lands.<br /><br />There are things of which you should be aware. If it is your first time flying you should stay away from trees and houses. If you get it on top of something high there is a good chance it's going to stay up there. We have gotten one stuck in a very tall tree and it has gone through tough winds and thunderstorms and it still is stuck on a branch.<br /><br />Pros<br />-lots of replacement parts if something gets damaged<br />-the ability to get extra batteries is awesome<br />-very durable<br />-really good for the price<br />Cons<br />-batteries take a long time to charge<br />-LED covers come off easily<br />-guards snap easily<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this drone. The number of replacement parts and the ability to get extra batteries makes it a great drone! Although without the extra batteries it would be less enjoyable because the batteries; last for a while, but take an extremely long time to charge. It doesn't take to long to change batteries it has instructions to guide you through step by step. Its quality is amazing! It still does have some problems, but they are common problems for drones like wind and other circumstances in which you can't fly it.

Recommend getting replacement propellors for it because they can get bent if you crash alot, also multiple battery packs if you are going to take it out somewhere because it will die.

412,5.0,Great little starter drone to learn how to fly,"Great starter drone!  The only bummer is the camera is not a live camera, but this drone taught me a lot about piloting.  I knew I wanted to learn on a cheaper on. I would be seriously sad face if I bought an awesome (and expensive) one but did something stupid to crash it and break it.<br /><br />I bought extra propellers and keenstone 6Pcs 720mAh 20C battery with 6-Port Quick Charger for Syma.  I think the batteries and charger were a good investment, but because I installed the included propeller guards, I have yet to even break 1 propeller.  The package already comes with 4 replacement ones so I don't think you really need to buy any out the gate if you don't want to.  The camera can take pictures, record sound and video.<br /><br />Regarding the camera, let's just make it completely clear - the video quality is seriously lacking.  Lack of stabilization will make any longer video clips unwatchable without editing to clear up the camera shake.  The image quality will absolutely not be the same as go pro or similar cameras.<br /><br />Considering I got this drone for less than three average eat out lunches, I think it's a good deal for learning.  Consider this a gateway drone.  If you get hooked, this one will make you buy more :)<br /><br />I attached a still image from the camera.  It was taken in a park a little before the sun started to go down and the light was still good.  I took several other photos at other times.  They are all similar quality, so if you want something high res, look at the Parrot Bebop 2 or something a lot higher end.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714gH1d5zJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714gH1d5zJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714gH1d5zJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714gH1d5zJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714gH1d5zJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714gH1d5zJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHYEEDVXTOLLPVJ4K22NTQJQNA2A,1478660123000,12,True

Several things people should know this is not a toy quad but a nice beginner practice quad and also it is totally modifiable. I have replaced the rotors for different color ones for easier operation at high altitude. bought here on amazon. Also replaced the motors for the ones with brass gears. Extended the antenna on the quad and replaced the antenna from a used 2.4ghz router I had lying around. ALSO all of these upgrades have already been done by other people who posted videos explaining in detail how to do all of the mods. Now i just cant wait for the snow to pass so i can do ultimate altitude test, hoping to get above the mountain range at my friends farm. Last time was very close probably around 600 feet.

484,4.0,Out of the box fun!,"Ok, after some minor assembly! ;) I could hardly stand the wait for the battery to charge. I ordered a six-pack of additional batteries, but they arrived just today (several days later than the quad), and are on the charger now. I wasn't about to fly this the first time outside; I played with the controls in the house. Just up and down, up and down ... then tilting and turning. My carpet and furniture is a little easier on hard landings. :) After I felt at least a little comfortable with the controls, I took it outside just to see it go straight up from me as high as I dared, which was about 50 feet over the house. I was able to slowly learn how to hover it directly in front of me at a specific height, and then rotate the quad in its space 360°. 7 minutes of charge doesn't last long on the battery, and my time was quickly up.<br />  The new batteries are all charging, so I will be learning to fly more again today. Thanks for the tip I saw on a prior comment about putting your phone number on it. I have a Dymo label maker I will use for that! (and my address!)<br />  The dropped star rating is due to the poor instructions (non-English-speaking person who wrote it for sure!). There is an 8GB storage card that was included, already inside the camera! Bonus! There is also an orange memory card adapter, perhaps, with a USB port on one end, and perhaps the other end is to insert the memory card to view it? However, there are no directions, and there is no mention of it in the included &#34;manual&#34;. Also the slot for the supposed memory card is too big/wide for this small micro card.<br />  As a very novice flyer of this quad, I am taking my time to LEARN before I just willy-nilly go outside and fly it off into the trees or onto the roof of the house, or someone else's! My first 7 minutes was FUN!<br />  Lastly, as I came here to write this review today, 6 days after buying mine here on Amazon, the price has gone from 37.99 to 45.99 in six days! :O",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFTUEQ3UY7VYTC5DDW3GEN556LBA,1494268876000,4,True

525,5.0,Syma X5c takes a beating and keeps on flying!,I love flying this drone.  I can't believe what I got for like $43.  I did buy extra batteries with a multiple charger.  I also like that I can buy a replacement drone for around $26.  It REALLY takes a beating. I have been practicing flying under cars and missing curbs. I did finally beat it up a bit to much and now one of the gear slips.  I'm now flying my new drone using the same controller.  I did some video and pictures I guess they are okay.  About what you would expect for $43.  However I bought it to learn to fly and in no time I'm getting it.  I did color the front guards red with a sharpie which helped learning to fly a lot!  I recommend the x5c and not the x5w because the skids on the x5c actually help flying so you can skid it across the ground.,[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEP6KKJZIF3QYVD4FBYMAML56TYQ,1467855939000,0,True
526,5.0,Awesome Drone/Quadcopter For The Money,"[[VIDEOID:921d398e8cade6c833d889f341196dff]] I am not really sure what some of the reviewers here expect from a $60 quadcopter, but this thing is really one of the best deals out there.  Remember, you are buying a $60 TOY, not a professional/commercial grade drone that delivers super clear, super stable HD video designed for your 50&#34; TV.  That being said, I feel that it delivers more than $60 worth of features.<br /><br />This is my first &#34;drone&#34;, so that is my point of view.  I did own one of those small helicopters though.  The quadcopter handles 10 times better than that though.<br /><br />Most notably, the little copters seem to be nearly unflyable if there is even the slightest breeze.  The X5C, on the other hand, seems to fly relatively well, even if there is a small breeze.  Obviously you need to compensate for the wind, but it still can be used.  You definitely should be careful though if you fly it high and there is some wind.  It can get caught in a gust and start getting away from you.  Furthermore, when it is that high up, you can lose track of its orientation and this can make it difficult to correct its course.  Someone mentioned putting your phone number on it in case it does get away from you.  I will be doing that before my next flight...just in case.<br /><br />One of the CONS of the X5C is the lack of a RETURN or HOME button that brings the copter back if it starts getting away.  That being said, only a couple times has mine gotten further away than I was comfortable with.  Both times I immediately cut power and just let it fall to the ground.  Once it landed safely in a neighbors yard.  Once in a tree.  I had to get the football out and knock it free.  The copter is light enough that even when it free falls, it doesn't pick up a ton of speed.  This allows for safer &#34;crash&#34; landings.<br /><br />That brings me to the next point.  While the blade protectors do a good job protecting the blades and absorbing some of the impact from crashing, they will also get caught in branches a lot easier.  And please note that you (or your kid or dad or your buddy) WILL get this caught in a tree at least once, if you are flying anywhere near them.  So bear that in mind when selecting a flight area.  Until you become really adept at controlling the X5C, I would recommend an open field of some sort.  I would also keep it within 20 feet of the ground until you get the hang of it.  If you are near trees, make sure you have a football or similar object you can use to dislodge the copter if it becomes stuck in a tree.  Alternately, a trained monkey can be used to retrieve your copter from a tree (if you have access to one).<br /><br />I am actually quite impressed by the durability of this little thing.  It has been crashed by myself and other operators dozens and dozens of times.  The only damage has been one of the blade protectors has cracked.  I am ordering spares now, before it completely breaks off.  I highly recommend spending the $7 to order the spare part set on line.  You will likely need them somewhere along the line.  $7 is cheap insurance and allows you the piece of mind that you already have the spare parts if something does break, and you don't have to end your fun on that day.<br /><br />I would also suggest spare batteries and a charger.  7 minutes of flight goes pretty quick, and the recharge is NOT quick.  I bought a 6 pack of batteries and a 6-way charger.  This gives me and any companions an hour of flight time, perhaps more if the first battery has recharged by the time the last goes dead.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned marking the &#34;front&#34; of the quad so you can identify it from the ground.  This is an excellent idea.  I spray painted the front two blade protectors red.  It definitely helps me to know which way the quad is oriented.  And that is key to successfully flying the X5C.<br /><br />I do like the two different optional controller modes.  I prefer to have &#34;rotate&#34; on the same stick as my &#34;forward/reverse&#34;, rather than having &#34;strafe right/left&#34; on the &#34;forward/reverse&#34; stick.  This controller has the option for either setup.  Perhaps if I was videoing a moving object it may be more usable in the opposite mode?  Furthermore, the controller also has two different speed modes.  The standard mode is definitely responsive and quick, but there is also an expert mode for even more responsiveness and speed.  I haven't really found the need for the expert mode yet.<br /><br />As for the camera, this is a $60 drone.  How much of that do you think goes into the camera?  For $60 you shouldn't set your expectations too high.  You will get relatively clear video and photos, just don't expect it to look like something you would see on TV.  TV shows spend A LOT more on their drones.  With this quad, you will get a nice look at your neighborhood and all of your neighbors backyards.  You will get a nice video of yourself flying the quad or videos of people you are flying the X5C into.  Please be aware though that the camera is fixed and it points pretty much to the front.  It does have some downward projection, but it is more forwards than down.  When videoing anything you will pick up the sound of the quad buzzing more than anything.  The sound is all but useless.  The video will likely be a little shaky as when you rock the X5C when controlling it, you will also be rocking the camera.  When you fly forwards you will get more of a downward shot, but when you &#34;brake&#34; or fly backwards you will get the sky.  When you flip (using the flip button on the controller), you will not be able to make out much of anything.  It is nice that you can snap pics and turn the video ON/Off from your controller.<br /><br />All in all, this is an awesome $60 drone! It is a great investment for hours of fun.<br /><br />I am really curious as to what would make the UDI 818A selling for double the price worth the extra dough.  From what I can tell, the only missing feature (other than the HOME button) would be the HEADLESS MODE / Intelligent Orientation Control (IOC) System which allows for simpler navigation (orientation of copter doesn't matter).  I am not sure that feature is worth another $60.  With a little practice, this thing is easy enough to fly without that feature.  Furthermore, from the reviews I read, there seems to be more complaints about the UDI 818A being affected by wind than the X5C.<br /><br />If you are thinking about a quadcopter in the $50-$150 range, I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />Note:  The X5C is light enough that it does not require registration with the FAA.<br /><br />I attached a video I took with it shortly after learning to fly it.  It gives a good example of the video you will get.  Not sure how much Amazon distorts the video.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHIP5JODDPK76PHMK5BFEU7ANNLA,1451940901000,1,True

536,5.0,"Poor manual, short battery life, but still a great toy for the price","[[VIDEOID:c270bbf2c30f9b64f076af1d155c5e42]] All considered, this is an excellent buy. The user's guide is poorly translated from probably Chinese..really hard to decipher but with some patience my kids and I figured it all out. Lots of features. The battery takes 75 minutes to charge but flies only 7 minutes and much less if you have the camera on. The camera btw takes 1280x720 30fps video WITH SOUND (but motor noise drowns out other sounds-- see my video clip), at an average of 2.4MBps or about 142-143 MB per minute. A generic 4GB microSD card is already included so that gives you a total of 3810/143= 25 to 28 minutes of video time. Video quality is surprisingly sharp and clear with good contrast. Of course watching too much of it can make you feel motion sick.. LOL.. Still pic resolution is 2560x1440 but very highly compressed so not good for looking at.<br /><br />Btw the included 4GB SD card wasn't reliable in my case, gave me file errors the first time I tried to download the files. (There's no streaming from the camera or FPV flying).  I switched to a Sony microSD and have been error free since even tho we've crashed this a million times.<br /><br />This makes a great starter quad. Its handling is middle of the road of the ones I've played with. At least the copter is responsive when within range. You do need to do some trimming each time which is kind of painful at the start but manageable eventually. Once trimmed try not to crash the chopper too much.LOL.. You'll probably crash a lot if you're new. This thing stands up to crashes pretty good except the battery door keeps on comign off upon crash. I'm ordering a 2nd one so my kids can keep on practicign flying this. They want an FPV eventually.. Lots of powerlines and big trees where we live. So this is just perfect for practicing like I said.

539,4.0,A great stepping stone for aspiring drone enthusiasts,"The Syma X5C quadcopter is an affordable model that offers an opportunity to get your feet wet piloting a drone without the fear of trashing or losing a thousand dollar drone and camera kit. For $50, it offers plenty of fun and practice at very low risk.<br /><br />I have flown the DJI Phantom and several toy single- and multi-rotor copters. This fits somewhere in between. It feels very much like a toy with the cheap, plastic body; however, it flies like a more serious quadcopter.<br /><br />Because the X5C is purely radio controlled with no input from GPS, altitude control is completely manual. That makes the X5C harder to fly than the DJI Phantom. So if you are aspiring to buy a Phantom or a 3DR Solo, the X5C will certainly prep you for the piloting aspect of it.<br /><br />What the X5C won’t prepare you for is the complexity of the setup and preparation process for flying more advanced drones. And that’s a good thing if this is your first quadcopter.<br /><br />There is no compass calibration or linking to GPS satellites. The X5C’s transmitter is linked to the quadcopter and there is no relink process after firmware upgrades. You just pull it out of the box, put batteries in it and go fly.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the best things about the X5C is that it is small and light enough to fly inside. Of course, you can’t really get crazy with maneuvering indoors but learning to control the throttle under ceilings that are only nine feet high helps you get a good feel of the drone.<br /><br />The X5C is equipped with a built-in camera. I use the term “camera” loosely though. If you frequent this site, there is really nothing about the camera that will be satisfactory to you. The resolution is 1280 x 720 for the video using a Motion JPEG codec in .AVI file format. The photos are 3.6MP. The sharpness in both formats is abysmal.<br /><br />While it is easy to capture photos or video via the transmitter controls, unless lighting is just perfect, the photos will just look like terrible. If the lighting is sufficient and the X5C isn’t vibrating too bad at the moment of capture, it can be an okay result.<br /><br />The Syma X5C delivers somewhere between 6-10 minutes flight time, depending on the conditions. The good thing though is that batteries for the X5C are cheap and pretty simple to replace.<br /><br />The remote has trim controls on it to keep it hovering pretty evenly. I haven’t quite been able to get it to hold without any drift. However, it is pretty close and good enough to maintain control and hover indoors with just a little input from me.<br /><br />Outside, the X5C does okay in conditions up to a light breeze. It is extremely lightweight, so that plastic body will really catch the wind if you get much of a gust. This is not something you want to fly in tight spaces outside.<br /><br />The X5C also seems to be pretty robust. I’ve crashed it from 8-feet or so indoors and probably close to 25-feet outdoors (onto grass) without so much as a broken rotor yet.<br /><br />In sum, the Syma X5C is a great little quadcopter that borders between toy and hobbyist-level drones. It has enough features to whet your appetite for a more advanced and more expensive package without the risk of breaking your heart if you crash it or lose it.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHXGOHL4YD62QPFSX2DDYNZLLIGA,1438296281000,2,True

My wife and kids were able to fly it pretty quickly, too. I've taken it outdoors and flown high enough for it to get out of range of the controller (seems like 140-200 feet or so); once it does that, it just comes back down. If it gets back in range, quickly enough, you can regain control of it. The camera takes surprisingly good videos (with audio) though sometimes the videos don't seem to save properly.

555,4.0,Great Drone For Beginners,"With so many drones out there I wasn't sure which kind to get but came across this one and liked the features and price so I figured I would give it a shot. Boy am I glad I did. This was a gift for my almost 12 year old son (and husband). They have been playing with it everyday since receiving it and it has held up GREAT.<br /><br />I would also suggest that you fly this drone in a very open area because it goes really high and can get stuck on top of roofs. We live right across the street from a grocery store and the drone flew right on top of the roof. It happened on Christmas morning so we had to wait until the next day to contact the manager to get on the roof and get it. They thought it was pretty funny! The drone is really easy to fly and maneuver. It only took my son a few flights to get the hang of it.<br /><br />I also want to say how durable this drone is. It has seen it's fair share of crashes and it has held up nicely.<br /><br />CON: The battery does not last long and takes forever to recharge. I would suggest investing in a few extra batteries so that you can play for longer than 7 minutes at a time. It's such a bummer to be flying the plane and then have to stop because your battery dies. We also haven't been able to download the video shot from the Drone because it's not compatible with the computers we have. Not sure if this is something that is an ongoing problem with other people or just the fact we don't have the right software. But either way it's a bummer we haven't figured out how to see the photo and video footage.<br /><br />Overall this is a great drone for beginners or people used to flying drones.

It is easier to control than the Hubson X4 that can't be controlled at all but that seems to be because it's bigger and slower so it can't get away as fast. The best I can do with it is to barely keep it in my yard but I have to stay on the sticks all the time since it tends to dart to the left or right or zoom way up into the air or dive to the ground by itself.  The camera takes good videos but they will be pretty jerky since the quad can't hover or stay still enough.  It does stay level by itself, something the Pixhawk can't do, but that's about all.  A lot of reviews say it can hover and one on YouTube even says it can hover hands free but don't believe it, they are just making that up and were probably paid to say it since the craft doesn't have that capability.  The Parrot can sort of hover since it has an altimeter and downward facing camera to find it's position but the X5C doesn't have anything like that.

597,5.0,Durable and super fun!,"[[VIDEOID:dee26fb89e208c619822d3fe8ddad1f1]] While I'm saving up for a proper quad/drone I decided to buy this relatively inexpensive one to start learning how they fly, to get the feel for them etc. This thing is tons of fun for the entry-level toy that it is. I read the manual and had the controls figured out within a few minutes. It's pretty durable. I've crashed it more times than I can count and our border collie snatched it out of the air once and raced around the yard with it. No damage, but a few scuffs from crashing into pavement. I do have the prop guards installed, at least until I become a quad jedi master.<br /><br />Battery life is better than I expected. I haven't timed it, but it seems like I have a good amount of time on a charge, even with video. I've got the five battery pack on order though because it does take a long time for the battery to recharge once it's depleted. It handles a good breeze without any trouble.<br /><br />UPDATE: Got this stuck about 40 feet up a honey maple tree (1.5 inch thorns) and had no way to get it down. I wrote it off as lost forever and went on with my life. This was in the summer. Months later, after going through nasty thunderstorms, rain, snow, ice storms, and freezing weather.... it fell out of the tree. I recovered it, put a fresh battery in it and... it works perfectly. Impressive.<br /><br />Photo and video quality is a lot better than I anticipated on a quad at this price. It's not going to film any weddings, but for messing around and getting aerial photos of your house or your neighborhood, this will work.<br /><br />This would be a great toy for a kid who's into this kind of thing, or for an adult who's still able to tap into that kid kind of fun. Great product!<br /><br />EDIT: The attached video demonstrates that it goes pretty high up. The quality of that video was degraded when it was uploaded.

Certainly in the toy category but for the price it is an amazing little machine.  It comes equipped with a very decent HD camera that shoots video in AVi format and also takes still pictures.  I had never even held a drone let alone fly one until this unit arrived.  And at first I was crashing repeatedly. But after a couple of days and some reading about navigation I was able to pilot the X5C very easily.  It has an easy to use control unit and drone responds rapidly to changes in course or height.  It's also a very resiliant drone and hasn't shown the slightest bit of damage from many crash landings.  The worst that has happened is losing a few blade guards but replacements are cheap and easy to put on.  The flight time is about 7 or 8 minutes.  Spare batteries swap out easily to keep it going.  I think the video quality is good considering the price of this unit.<br /><br />Flying the X5C has become a new found pleasure for me.  I'm 61 years old and new to this concept but I have to fly it everyday and thoroughly enjoy it.  It's fun to watch the videos, including the crashes!<br /><br />I suggest investing in some spare parts upfront, including blade guards and extra batteries all of which are cheap.<br /><br />This unit is great for beginners or if you are on a budget.  If you are looking for a starter drone I highly recommend the X5C.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGUMJZOJH5UH6T6RG4XGKTFMGUEQ,1498678899000,1,True

My 12yo son loved it, and couldn't get enough of it. It was pretty easy to learn to fly, the camera worked great, and it provided hours of outdoor enjoyment.<br /><br />However, if I were to review the X5C AFTER the first 3 days, I would have to give it zero stars (thus the 3-star rating above). Why? Because the motor on one of the four blades began to rotate slower than the other three, and now it is basically unflyable. Note that there were no major crashes before this occurred, and in fact it appears in good shape overall. I am going to try to fix it, but it is pretty lame that it only worked for three days before being worn out.

It's black, so you can't get confused. Otherwise, it's the same exact drone as the X5C with the exception of the camera pod. The new model is nicer as it just pops on and off, no screw. But, the drawback with the SW is it can't take stills on board as the X5C can. You take the pictures or videos from the phone or tablet itself, not just view them. The controller switch for the camera doesn't do anything. Too bad, the controller is by far, the easiest way to take pictures and videos. So it's a mixed bag and that's why I have both.<br /><br />I keep both of mine in padded hard cases.

712,4.0,Great first step into camera Quadcopters.,"Great first step into the Quadcoptoer world with camera. My first step with a quad came with the Husban X4 and loved it. Decided after seeing a deal pop up on a slightly larger quad with a camera to give it a shot. Jumping up in size slightly from the X4 was very easy as the controls are the same for the most part outside of a few additional buttons.<br /><br />As with most Quads, be patient and get comfortable with the controls before just throwing these things into advanced mode. It is very responsive when in this mode.<br /><br />I did knock one star for camera quality, but I did know this going in that it was not GoPro quality. Don't expect movie quality images in 1080. Best description i can say is think of this as a camera phone from around 2008 or 2009. Maybe even compare it to an early 2000's webcam.<br /><br />There is no return mode or headless mode. Once this thing is out of range it will input remember the last input and use that for a few seconds before just dropping out of the sky.<br /><br />Edit- 12-14-15<br />After some flying and trying to get a feel for the camera angle, it is definitely angled a little to far down.  simple fix is wedging a very slim piece of light packing foam between the battery door and battery. I then used a very thin piece of Velcro to wrap around the body and secure the door shut aiming the camera more forward.  Doing this allows a more straight forward view while recording. The addition does not appear to add any noticable weight to the quad copter and does not hamper the controls in any way.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEGG6J4FIFJE4ECSQZSUCQ667IMA,1449494816000,0,True
713,4.0,"Keep Your Friends Close, and Your Quadcopter Closer","For the money, it's amazing!  Hard to believe you can get a still and video camera in the sky for this cheap.<br /><br />That being said, I'll advise anyone who buys one to keep it pretty low to the ground since the range is not very far.  I went out in dead calm wind and decided to get some pictures from above the treetops.  It was dusk, so I could see the LED lights on the bottom of the craft.  Right up above my head, about 200 feet and the thing started blinking (indicating loss of signal).  Then it spun and went off in a random direction, and started coming down (still under power).  Luckily a connection was re-established, and I was able gain orientation and fly it back from over some trees.  But unless you're a pretty good pilot, that would have been the end of your play time since when it gets out of range, it will spin, changing orientation and then it's up to the pilot to figure out the orientation and begin corrections to keep it from going in the wrong place.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEDKHICQ7MRBHELAJT3TYIU4KTOA,1433202336000,0,False

715,5.0,Amazing. For the price it is unbeatable.,"Amazing product for the price. This is the first quadcopter I've ever flown or owned. If you want to learn how to use a camera quadcopter/drone before buying a bigger more expensive version get this to start. It does take some practice to fly but was quite easy once I learned how. Fly it indoors to start and keep it a couple inches off the ground until you get the hang of it. Use the trim buttons on the remote to zero it in. The first time I flew this outdoors I got it caught in a tree because my piloting skills weren't good enough yet. I had to duct tape a 20 foot painters pole to a 16 foot tree saw pole to get high enough to get it down. Even after falling through the tree branches all the way to the ground it was completely undamaged. It feels cheap but it is remarkably tough. Today I flew it in an open park area and even with some strong breezes I was able to control it. It takes some concentration but this copter is precise enough that you can hover and land on a platform that is 6 inches square or even on your own hand. For the price I paid I have zero complaints. The battery life is not very long but for less than 9 bucks you can buy these two extra batteries like I did. Mudder Upgraded 680mAh 3.7V Lipo Rechargeable Battery for Syma X5 X5C Quadcopter. I would also recommend putting a rubber band around the middle of the copter to hold the battery door/camera on better. If you bump the ground too hard it could pop the battery door open. Easy fix. Video quality is not crystal clear and not stabilized so don't expect professional footage but for the price you can't beat it. It also records sound but likely you will only hear the propellers and wind noise. Still, it is pretty cool that it even has sound. This thing is great! Go get one.

732,5.0,Totally awesome,"This is an excellent budget drone.  The micro-drones out there are junk; this is not.<br /><br />Of course it's not as user-friendly as a $500 drone, but it's still easy to fly, a total novice can get the hang of it quickly.<br /><br />And it's REALLY durable.  The material is pretty flexible so it absorbs a lot of crashes without breaking.  Parts will eventually wear out, but replacement parts are cheap and plentiful.  The only complaint is it has so many screws to remove to replace parts.<br /><br />I've been using it for several months and, even though they're pretty beat up now, I'm still on my first set of blades.  All I've had to do was replace one LED cover that came off when it got stuck in a rain gutter, and I just had to replace one motor - it still worked but when it heated up the performance would drop and destabilize the drone.  Aside from all the screws, replacing the motor was cheap and easy.<br /><br />In summary, if you want to get into drone flying without a big investment, this is an excellent choice.  Pick up some spare batteries while you're at it.<br /><br />EDIT - Last winter I was flying this thing in the backyard and it got seriously stuck up in a tree way too high to get at.  It was up there for months, heavy sun and numerous thunderstorms.  I was planning on replacing it but just hadn't gotten around to it; expected corrosion to the board and/or motors from all that weather exposure to have killed it.<br /><br />Finally, after maybe four months, one day it fell out of the tree.

733,5.0,Excellent beginner quadcopter before purchasing a Phantom or a quadcopter to just mess around and fly for fun,"Pros: fast, symmetric, very light, very agile, not too expensive comparing to most quadcopters, this one came with 2 sets of rotors, white set installed, and another white set as an extra spare. Has a 2mp camera with an SD card, SD card reader, one battery with a charger and a remote. A lot of fun to fly, very durable. Screw driver to mount the rotor protectors/bump guards.<br /><br />Cons: did not come with batteries for the remote, camera quality is equivalent to an old school flip phone camera.<br /><br />Overall: I love flying this quadcopter, this is my one of my two x5c editions so my review is very much similar to the other one. My other one is the X5C-1 and the only difference that I have noticed between X5C and X5C-1 is the packaging difference. X5C came in a bigger box with a plastic insert comparing to X5C-1 that came with a styrofoam insert and a smaller box.<br /><br />The quadcopter is very agile, has two modes for the speeds, high and low. High speed is great for outdoor flying, sharp turns and great angles of attack. Low speed is great for the house or for more accurate precision. Flying it is a lot of fun and I would definitely suggest this as beginner quadcopter to practice and learn the flying techniques. This quadcopter is missing the headless mode and the auto-return feature but I believe that is not too much of a bad thing. Flying in regular mode will allow you to become better at flying in general. You should not fly the quadcopter farther than you can see it. Definitely purchase a couple of extra batteries to enjoy your flying sessions. One battery lasts approximately 10 minutes and takes approximately 60 minutes to charge. I overdid it and purchased 15 additional batteries (good for when my friends fly the other one). Should give me more than enough flight time, just got to make sure to allow for the motors to cool down in between sessions as they are brushed motors and are somewhat fragile to high heat conditions.<br /><br />The remote is very easy to figure out. Direction booklet explains all of the controls and buttons so there's no need to review that. I can tell you that remote to quad communication is awesome and pretty long distance. I have not yet found an area where I can max out the quadcopter distance without running into obstacles or losing the sight of it. It did not come with batteries but so far I have a couple of hours of flight time and the battery indicator still says full. Might want to consider getting some rechargeable batteries.<br /><br />I've crashed this quadcopter several times now, a couple of times into the wall, a couple of times into the ceiling, have dropped it a couple of times while panicking during flight and shutting down the throttle. It has held up to all of the crashes, has minor scratches on the plastic but no significant damage. The other day I was trying to test the flight range in a retail store parking lot and ended up accidentally flying into the concrete wall of the store due to misjudging how close I was to it. The quad fell straight to the ground and hit the pavement, I thought that was it. Gave it some throttle and it came right back up and continued to fly like nothing ever happened. Flying inside and outside are completely different experiences so if you start to get frustrated with indoor flights, don't give up. The lower temperature higher density air outside makes flying a completely different experience. You need half the throttle outside to get up to the same altitude as you would need indoors.<br /><br />A buddy of mine purchased the Skyviper from a local retail store because he liked my quadcopter. It cost him almost 3x the price I paid for my X5C and it was no near as accurate or fun to fly as the Syma is. He ended up returning it back to the retail store. I played with it as well and was very disappointed in it but at the same time very impressed with the quality of the X5C quad.<br /><br />The camera is no good. I took mine off to save on the battery power and weight to get more flight time. It's okay to mess around but the quality of video and images is pretty poor. It does have sound though comparing to the camera that came on my buddy's Skyviper. If you're interested in aerial photography, this could be your stepping stone to learn with to avoid possibly crashing a more expensive piece of equipment.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review and if you have any questions feel free to ask as I personally very much enjoy this product and will try my best to help get anyone else's questions answered for them to get the best experience out of it.<br /><br />I earlier mentioned that I own a couple of quadcopters, others being Syma X8 and DJI Phantom 4. The x5c was my learning, stepping stone to the other ones. I highly recommend flying it before purchasing a bigger version: x8 and definitely before purchasing an expensive aircraft like P4.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718KJVL8xjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718KJVL8xjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718KJVL8xjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V1RA3IiFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V1RA3IiFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V1RA3IiFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vS+DaOtPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vS+DaOtPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vS+DaOtPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MoCQaVmfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MoCQaVmfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MoCQaVmfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHP7QXEZAE7D6P57H4IWZRHKXNTQ,1459323716000,8,True
734,5.0,A great starter drone and a really fun toy,"I bought this for my brother for Christmas, and he LOVES it. He works in a building with a large bay with high ceilings, he takes it to work with him half the time to play with after hours. I've also had a chance to fly it outside, and it's pretty fun. I also got him some extra 600mAh batteries, I should have gone with the 700mAh ones. This drone can fly in a light wind, and it's very manageable as long as it's steady, but any sort of gusting wind will make it very hard to control. It's also surprisingly tough, it's been dropped quite a few times onto both grass/dirt and concrete and it's still in one piece, even using the props that came with it.<br /><br />That said, don't expect it to lift pretty much anything. I was hoping to use it to lift a small cell phone, either a Samsung Mesmerize or Moto Droid Mini, for a poor man's FPV, but it simply doesn't have enough power to do it, even with the prop guards removed. Also, the prop guards don't stay on very well, they really need longer screws.<br /><br />Of course, now I want a quadcopter for myself, and I seriously considered buying one of these, possibly the X5W or X5SC model, or an X8*, but in the end I decided to spring for a Cheerson CX-20 instead.

Keep in mind it has been out side in the rain and the snow all that time. Checked to make sure it was dry, cleaned the caked dirt out of the gears, replaced the broke prop guard, put in a new battery, and turned it on.

790,5.0,Hours of enjoyment (a few minutes at a time),"If you want to spend fifty bucks on a toy that is easy and fun to fly then this is for you!<br /><br />It is truly a blast to fly!  It is easy enough to fly that you can pass the controls around at a party and almost anyone can quickly get the hang of it.<br /><br />Flying in a stiff breeze is more tricky but that's part of the fun.  Be careful of getting it up too high unless you have a lot of open space.  The winds a few hundred feet up can be a lot stronger than they are on the ground.  I got it up above the tree line and the wind took it away and even with full control input it couldn't make it back!  Fortunately it survived the inevitable plummet to earth and I found it over a block away.<br /><br />It is sturdy enough that it was survived every encounter with tree limbs, walls, and the ground.  I haven't even had to use the spare props yet.  The grass in a lawn or field seems to be enough to cushion most falls.  Don't fly it into something at full speed though.  The plastic isn't that thick.<br /><br />The camera adds more fun, though the quality is only fair.  Don't expect IMAX, but it is more than good enough for capturing scenes from up high in a way that you otherwise can't.  The camera looks in a fixed forward direction so every twitch of the controls leads to camera shake and direction change.  I find a slow 360 degree rotation (camera pan) a hundred feet or so over the house is quite satisfying.  At first the camera controls are a bit confusing (more than once I turned off the power instead of the camera) and you must remember starting and stopping video recording.  If the battery gives out while recording you often end up with a 0 length file and your video is lost.<br /><br />Stock battery life is short enough that it leaves you wanting more.  You get about 3 seconds between realizing that the battery is giving out and when it falls like a rock.  Keep it close when you think time is almost up.  A spare battery (or two) are needed if you are going to fly this away from a charger or want to pass it around at a park.<br /><br />So if you are not expecting all of the features that you have read about or seen in drones costing several hundred dollars (GPS fence, return to home, gimbal cameras, etc.) and just want some good fun on the cheap, the X5C can't be beat!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AF2GIQ4Q5JADS7ZYYUVRMSB3XEIQ,1431011071000,8,True

If you lose signal by flying too high on a breezy day the wind can carry the quad out of control range laterally before it can descend into range.,[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AF42WFSS6PIEM23R6M6SR6NXMVDA,1436430034000,0,True

The Male plug on the battery barely fits into the female plug, so use a razor blade to trim the tiny bumps on both sides of the male plug and you will have better contact.  Be careful of flying too far or too high, it will get out of range and fly pretty far before it falls from the sky.  Don't use the prop guards at all; they will hang it in a tree!

Sure, the camera is pretty crappy and the novelty of buzzy aerial shots wears off quick, but you'll likely be removing the camera, prop guards and landing struts before you know it anyway to squeeze a few extra minutes of flight time / speed out of it.

It comes with a small camera mounted on it that takes either still or video shots, and surprisingly decent for the price quality of pics/video. The only drawback is the 3.7 volt battery run time- approx. 5-7 minutes depending on wind conditions.  Also, keep in mind, when the battery gets below a preset voltage, it drops without any warning.. Buy a half dozen or more 600-650 mah spare batteries & good multi battery charger and you'll have a ton of fun with it. Also a side note- write your name & phone number on it with a black fine tip Sharpie in case you lose sight of it & can't locate it.

865,4.0,"Very good ""first"" quad copter","Ordered on 7-13-15, received on 7-15-15. Preface: I have never flown a quad copter before but I have a few hours in &#34;real&#34; turbine helicopters. I bought this to train with prior to upgrading to a larger, more capable quad.<br />  The box arrived in good shape and the quad was well packaged. The camera was already attached as were the landing legs. The only assembly required was to add the propeller (rookie) guards which took about 2 minutes using the included screwdriver. A set of 4 spare props was included.<br />The 1st thing I did was to remove the camera which I knew I wouldn't be using for awhile. I then took out the battery and began charging it using the included USB cable which I plugged into the wall socket for my I-phone. The plug for the battery is tiny- if you can't grab it with your fingers, use needle-nose pliers carefully. If you pull on the wires, they might come out of the plug, and then you are fubar.<br />  While the copter battery was charging I put 4 new AA batteries in the transmitter. Don't skimp here, lousy batteries might affect the performance of the transmitter. When you turn it on you will hear a loud beep and the green light above the switch will come on and flash and the LCD screen will light up- that's good. After about 10 mins of charging I put the copter battery back in so I could see if everything was working.<br />  To bind or &#34;pair&#34; the transmitter to the copter, turn the copter switch to &#34;ON&#34; while it is on a level surface. All of the LED's should flash. Then turn the transmitter on and push the left stick all the way forward- it should beep. Then pull all the way back and it should beep again and the green light should stay solid green. The copter LED's should stop flashing and remain on if you were successful. If you did this while the copter was not level, it won't fly correctly.<br />  I then went out to my back patio to see what this thing would do. I pushed the throttle (left) stick forward slightly and all props came on instantly. I advanced farther until the quad was just above the ground a few inches. It immediately began to drift forward so I set it back down and pushed the &#34;forward/backward&#34; trim switch in the opposite direction of the drift. (It's the chrome switch between the right stick and ON-OFF switch). On the right side of the LCD screen you will see 2 vertical lines. As you repeatedly push the trim switch you will see small boxes appear between the lines to show you where you have the trim set. The same applies for the two horizontal lines at the bottom of the LCD screen. The pair on the right indicate the left/right bank trim, set by the switch underneath the right stick.<br />  I lifted off again and it was now drifting to the right. I repeated the process for the left/right trim. The objective of trimming is to get the quad to hover by itself in calm wind with the least pilot input. I took off again and practiced hovering for a little while and then moved into the yard to see how it flew forwards and backwards, left and right. I tried to stay no more than about 5 feet off the ground. I was quite surprised how easy it was to control but I did have a few minor crashes. Clearly it will take more time to master but I was able to keep it in the backyard and out of the trees.<br />  When I get better, I'll take off the rookie guards, and try out the camera. So far everything seems to work as it should so I have no complaints and am very happy. As others have said, this thing is really fun and addictive and a good value for the price. I recommend that you mark the front and rear with colored tape or paint so you can tell which end is the front. I'll post more as time goes by.<br />UPDATE: 7-24-15: After a few more minor crashes, one of the wires came off the on/off switch on the copter. I opened it and discovered it was due to a cold solder joint. I re soldered it and it works fine! Also, the receptacle plug that the battery plugs into came loose so I epoxied it in place.<br />Gotta take a star off for those manufacturing defects. However, even after lots of crashes it still flys fine. The only &#34;flying&#34; issue I have with it is that it's impossible to maintain a hover at a constant altitude. No matter how still the copter remains it constantly wants to climb or descend. I'm just chalking it up to being a cheap quadcopter- I don't expect DJI 3 performance from it.<br />I installed the camera and it works just like it should. The video quality is amazing for such a tiny camera! It's not GoPro quality but its great if you just want to inspect your roof, neighborhood from the air or play around. Of course without a gimbal the video is only as steady as your flying but for the price it's a great value.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KJcZAKFwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KJcZAKFwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KJcZAKFwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHMMAWSUEMLMQUA2GOO7LRJWNGUA,1437010614000,33,True

Only down fall, which most of the quadcopters have, is the short battery life. It last about 10-15 minutes for me on a full charge. BUT I purchased two more batteries for 6.99 so I can just plug another one in and get going again. Only thing I recommend is to not go really high at first until you get the hang of it. Because you can't see which is the front of the drone so you try to figure it out while it's 100s of feet in the air. It's kinda difficult for first time flyers at the height.

It takes very good pictures and videos but is definitely not HD.<br /><br />I have experimented with RC planes and helicopters but am not a veteran flyer. I found the Symantec X5C easier to fly than RC planes or helicopters. If you are a newbie keep the drone properly oriented (camera facing away from you) and the controls will be very intuitive. Start practicing in a small space and graduate to large fields. This craft is very light so don't fly on windy days. Excellent drone for beginners. Well worth the price ($48 July 2015) for a drone, camera, battery, charger, micro SD card, some spare parts and a small screwdriver.

912,5.0,Awesome Flying Machine!,"This is a great little drone for people with no experience flying anything. I am terrible at video-games, but I have been able to fly this little drone with only a few practices. One thing I would recommend it to wait for a day that is not windy. It can get carried away in a snap. Also, fly it low for a while until you get used to it. Taking pictures and video is super easy, just push the C button up for photos and down for videos. The videos come out in avi files so I had to download a VLC player on my MAC. But that's no big deal. Photos and videos are very clear! The reviewers say there are no instructions. Mine came with a pretty detailed booklet actually that explains it all. Also, a lot of reviewers seem to by flying it in their yards. I would recommend you go to an open field where the grass is cut because on my first solo flight I just about got it stuck in a very tall tree. Thankfully, I was ably to fly it out of there and get it back down. Some of the reviewers say it's a toy. But be careful to let children use it. It clearly says on the box that it's for 14 and up. My 4 year old grandson flew it way up into the sky on a windy day. Well, good thing it got caught by  hill. So my recommendation is: Easy does it! Fly low for a while. Also, before you buy, realize that the flying time is 7-10 minutes and the recharging takes an hour or so. I am a teacher and am now thinking about how to use this with my students.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DHUmO+SnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DHUmO+SnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DHUmO+SnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGU3YXA4EX4UZADK7OMPMCZWMUJA,1436360983000,6,True

946,5.0,So much fun!,"Let me start off by saying that we've only owned this drone for one evening but it's already proved it's worth. After attaching the rotor guards and inserting a fresh battery we were ready to go. Began in the large living room just trying to get a feel for the thing. It's very responsive and easy to contol, but far more advanced than the basic RC helicopters we've flown in the past. The fact this this drone can rotate and turn adds a new degree of difficulty, but it's fine once you get the hang of it.<br />Take time to read the manual. The remote has a bunch of functions that are not clearly marked.<br />Once the wind died down we took it outside for a dusk flight. This is where the fast mode really shines. As long as you keep it within thirty yards of the remote you are good to go. Push it to 50 and you may lose it. I have a nice half acre hill on the back of my property and it was perfect.<br />The camera on the drone flashes to indicate if it's recording which is nice. If you take the camera off, which is pretty easy, the drone can do flips with the push of a button. Very impressive and cool.<br />We bought an external charger which came with five 700mha batteries. I can't recommend this enough. If tonight is any indication then this thing is going to be getting a lot of use in the future.<br />I'll be sure to post a follow up review, but for $40 I don't see how you can go wrong. Spend an extra $20 on batteries and you'll have a very nice flight system that will bring you a good hours worth of entertainment.<br />Tip. If flying outside, make sure the wind is very calm and you have lots of open space. Always take off into the wind and orient yourself to the drone so that the flight control is natural. Don't go full throttle either. Good flight is all about balance and small movements until you gain confidence and control.

955,4.0,"Fun, sturdy, a good buy!","So, I saw a brief article somewhere mentioning how much fun this was.  Having never owned a RC aircraft of any kind, I ordered it and it arrived quickly and intact.  First couple of flights resulted in some substantial crashes but the Syma survived OK.  Subsequent flights also included crashes, a recovery from a tree among them, but it survives still.  After ordering I thought about trying it out and possibly getting one for my 8yo grandson as well as he loves RC toys.  Well, I won't be doing that.  It does take some considerable finesse on the controls to keep the craft going where you want it to go, especially the throttle.  Beyond the abilities of most 8yo I suspect.  It is very light so any amount of wind really blows it around.  But, it will handle some wind if the pilot is sufficiently skilled.  I haven't quite arrived at that level yet :-)  In summary, if you want to try out a quadcopter, this is a good place to start, especially at the price.  The camera works OK but don't really expect HD.  Vids are pretty grainy but it's fun to see what your piloting looks like from the craft's perspective.  Now, I'm thinking of what quad to get next!<br /><br />Quick update... After a dozen flights or so, one of the motors failed.  Apparently they are easily damaged if a prop is prevented from spinning with power on, for example in event of a crash landing.  So, if you crash it, immediately move throttle to OFF position.  And, buy a couple of replacement motors.

I lost mine after a few flights and it's stuck in a tree with no way for me to get it down. Runs about 7-8 mins on a battery. Buy more batteries. Camera is OK, not great, but at this pricepoint I had no complaints. It worked well with a 32GB class 10 micro SD card as well. Sometimes it would need to take a break, even though I had more batteries ready. Maybe it was overheating?<br /><br />My biggest gripe is that it was very easily blown away in the wind, to a degree that the engines could not compensate adequately.

976,5.0,*THE* Starter quad. Very glad I picked this one.,"This has been one of my best Amazon purchases. It has been said many, many times, but if you are looking to get into QuadCopter flying, this is a fantastic unit.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Power - This little unit can fly as quickly and aggressively as I would expect any beginner would want it to go. The ability to change between precise and fast flying modes is not a gimmick; I've found it quite useful.<br />Durability - Except for my note below, this unit has held up well to several medium (3-5 meter) crashes. Pick it up, set it flat, and keep flying. I purchased spare blades but haven't needed to replace them yet.<br />Camera - The quality of the camera itself is pretty decent, considering the price of this unit. The pictures are rather high-resolution and the video is on par with a low-end cellphone.<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />Card Reader - Throw this thing away. It looks like a spare piece of plastic, but I was surprised to find out that it's actually USB reader for the included flash card. It does actually work. Or it did, for about 10 pictures. Fly all day, plug this card into your computer: Bam! All photos on the card are now corrupted. If you actually want to use the camera and card included in this kit, get something like [[ASIN:B009D79VH4 Transcend Information USB 3.0 Card Reader (TS-RDF5K)]] which works like a charm.<br />Video - This tiny camera is mounted on a tiny copter, and by very nature of the way this unit flies and requires adjustments, the camera footage ends up being very jerky and erratic. Also, the sound is pretty much just &#34;the sound of the 4 motors,&#34; which, while it adds to the ambiance and excitement of the video, doesn't really let you hear anything else.<br />Camera Mount - You can fly this unit without the camera to make it more agile, have battery life, and even unlock special flight maneuvers that are disabled when the camera is connected. The camera is connected to the battery cover with screws (tiny, tiny little screws) that you will probably not want to mess with in the field, if at all. Fortunately, the camera can be disconnected in about 3 seconds by just removing the battery cover. Unfortunately, now there is nothing holding the battery in place (and yes, it will fly out). If this unit came with a spare battery cover, it would make adding and removing the camera much easier.<br /><br />******<br />This unit took a crash from about 5-6 meters onto a grassy field and has started experiencing a problem with one of its rotors. It will not level itself out, but the unit appears to be capable of sending full power to that rotor if the accelerometer is activated. My brother has an identical unit and, after letting little kids fly (and crash) it at the park, it is experiencing nearly identical symptoms. I have not yet opened this unit up or done much more than a cursory field diagnosis; I will update this ticket when I have more information.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AE3B5QSFX7RMPGVX7DOWPWBPXYXQ,1445274890000,0,True

It flies very steady and I was easily able to control it to fly around inside of my house, even performing flips.  Of course, it's taking me some time to familiarize myself when the copter is oriented differently than my body.  The battery lasts for 7-10 minutes, but unless you're constantly flying, it feels like plenty of time to give it a few good crashes.  I would recommend an extra battery or two to swap out when having fun.<br /><br />Leaving off the blade guards and removing the camera saves battery life and makes the copter much zippier.

Response is agile, range is more than adequate (I haven't had it go out of range yet) and the stock camera is surprising for this price range. I added different colored tape on the front and back of this copter because I had difficulty distinguishing the direction of the quadcopter at a distance; with the tape, I was able to orient myself in relation to the quadcopter's direction. I once flew this copter so high that I &#34;lost&#34; it (quickly found it a few streets over), but the video shows the controls remained active throughout the flight--which was impressive, considering how far the copter was away from the controller. This little copter is fast and durable: I've crashed it into street lamps at full strafing speed and it's been ok. It came with extra blades, but after 6+ months of rough amateur use, I haven't been forced to replace any blades yet.

Other suggest flying without the camera, prop guards, and landing gear for a more nimble experience. There are lots of good youtube videos on operation if you need help.  I'm already thinking about more batteries, and I did buy more props - I replaced the forward white propellers with red ones to aid in flying.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEB7K7JXS27Z5MWCYDI4QPVI5YAQ,1432038224000,0,True

1071,5.0,Great Drone!,I've had this Multicopter for a couple of weeks now and love it.  I've taken out quite a few times and have already beat the hell out of it.  The only signs of damage it shows are the rotors being a bit scratched up.  I've dropped it from 30 feet up onto pavement multiple times and ran it into the side of my garage going very fast and all the parts are still intact.  The controls are very responsive and after only a little practice I was able to get it to hover and fly it around avoiding obstacles.  The image quality on the camera was much better than I was expecting and is great for the price.  The battery only gives about 10 minutes of flight time but they clearly stated this on the ad and spare ones are cheap so I don't really consider this an issue. This was exactly what I was looking for to start out with and I could not be happier.,[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHYDU4QHWPNPGRVLIUWH3IONJNMA,1445294959000,0,True
1072,5.0,Excellent value and great quad.,"This is my second quad.  My first was the very inexpensive Estes Proto X.  So that's the basis for my comparison.<br /><br />This quad is very stable and easy to fly using the low speed mode which you will want to do if you are taking pictures or video.  The quality of the images isn't great, but it is fine for a hobbyist like myself.  The flight time is good, but if you want more I would recommend buying a couple of extra batteries (I bought these: [[ASIN:B01581AVTA Keenstone® 6 Pcs 3.7V 720mAh 20C Lipo Battery Pack for Syma X5C X5C-1 X5SW X5SC X5A X5 Cheerson CW-20 Quadcopters-longer flying time and overcharge protection]]).  I have crashed it a couple of times into branches and the ground and I have had no damage yet.<br /><br />Once you are confident in your piloting skills there are mods and upgrades you can do such as motors or FPV camera upgrades.  I haven't done these, but I intend to do an FPV upgrade when I have the time and money.<br /><br />TLDR - Great quad for the money and perfect for the hobbyist.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEY36OMPFAEFQQPH54KLOCODFQIA,1461773451000,0,True

1076,5.0,Amazing Buy!,"WHAT A GREAT PURCHASE! Perfect for beginners or even intermediate level enthusiast. Recommend getting a bigger Micro SD card as the one that comes with is not very big. Very durable. Takes a beating. My only knock is the blade guards are a bit too soft. After a few crashes (Pilot caused not product caused) the guards bend in a bit, which the blades hit, so they need to be bent out often. Blades themselves hold up very well. I personally am looking to find alternatives for the blade guards. Something more durable but light. The drone flies very high and a pretty far distance horizontally. I would definitely buy again to just have another one.<br /><br />Far exceeds my expectations of the price point. I do recommend getting (Keenstone 3.7V 720mAh 20C battery with 6-Port Quick Charger for Syma X5, X5C, X5SC, X5SW and Cheerson CX-30W Quadcopters (Pack of 6)).

Apparently, you need to set the QC flat on a surface and then turn both the remote and QC on to have it 'sync' correctly.

I am very impressed and pleased with the simplicity and ease of use.  Sure, it would be nice to have live video feed to my computer monitor, but for the money this is an incredibly good  and high functioning item.  After flying it for a while I went back on Amazon and purchased four more batteries (600 mah) and charger so that I don't have to wait 75 minutes to charge the battery before I can get back to flying.  I did all my flying indoors yesterday just to get the balance fine tuned, make sure it can hover fairly steadily without a lot of input from me.  I will take it outside today as long as there isn't much wind, and see how high it will go.  The video is really pretty good, in color, with pretty good detail for such a tiny camera.  I wouldn't worry about doing a time stamp for each video, as it is easier to add that to the file name after saving it to  my computer.  Excellent item, highly recommended.<br />Update as of July 22, 2015:<br />After several uses and various crashes it quit working, the blades on one side wouldn't go as fast, causing it to tip to one side and it wouldn't go up in the air.  I replaced two motors with new ones but no dice.  Same problem.  Probably some problem with the speed control.  So, I gave up on it and bought another one.  Since then I have used the new one several times, took lots of videos and lots of hard landings, still works great.<br />On a secondary issue, the camera works great.  I love the videos, although it does have a fairly narrow field of view.  I bought the Leegoal(TM) Detachable 0.67X Wide Angle Macro Lens and stuck it on the camera to see if I could get a better view, but although it seems to have good focus, the field of view is not significantly better.  Probably would need to have a fisheye lens to get a better field of view.  By the way, I discovered by accident that it does also record audio along with the video.  The downside of this is that about the only thing you hear is the loud whine produced by the motors and copter blades, kinda like listening to the vacuum cleaner.<br />As has been mentioned previously, once you get it 100 feet or more in the air, it gets hard to control as it blends in with the color of the sky.  Probably would be good to paint at least one half of it a dark color to make it easier to tell which way it is headed.  When it gets behind you it can be confusing which way to go.  I usually just land it and start over.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGVX25HPW3HRCSPF6D246CIECOFQ,1434031875000,1,True

Only draw back is the throttling up and down it is very very touchy it is either all the way up ir all the way down. Rang is ok for 60 bucks video and pics are great. But just to show how tuff it is. When i first got it i lost control because it was so high and went of of range and the wind took it. I drove around the neighborhood and could not find it. A week later a guy should up at my house with it. It landed on his roof and sat there for 3 days till a storm blow it off and he pulled the card and aay the video of were i lived. I charged the battery and it flow like a champ after all that. As well as being stuck in a tree and haveing sticks thrown at it to get it down twice. It finally became inop when my 11 year old son flow it into the house and it lost a small gear that spins on of th3 blades.  No big thou worth the 6 bucks for the parts kit from amazon to fix and let my kids keep flying. Battery time is only like 7 to 10 min tops . Dont spend money on extra batterys .

I tried this one indoors, but it's just too big for indoors.  I set it aside, and sort of forgot about it.<br /><br />I finally picked it up again, and took it to my sister's house for a picnic.  She has a large back yard.  Powered it up, got the trim set up pretty quickly, and was flying it decently in no time.

I managed to take a couple of stills, and then two videos.  Brought it home, and couldn't figure out how to retrieve the video at first.  I thought initially I had to connect the camera directly to the computer.  I then discovered the thing had a 16 GB SD card in it!  It came with a USB card reader.  I plugged it in, and downloaded the contents.  One video was over 300 MB.<br /><br />I was blown away at the quality for something so cheap.  I managed to get it to do a rotation while recording video (it says that is not possible in the manual, but it worked).  See attached video.  The only ridiculous part is, it records audio.  All you can hear is the sound of the propellors.<br /><br />It's not a drone - it's a decent large quad-copter.  Your neighbors might think it is a drone, though, so be cautious.

1156,3.0,Overall great quad! Charger broke easily though...,"After owning the quad for 3 days now, i have enountered a major problem or two. First off, one of the props was loose and fell off after flight one, so  I was forced to replace it. And the second problem is the charger refuses to charge the battery. I have purchased several accessories for this and one is another charger, which won't get here until a month from now. So I have no way to fly the quad until the middle of June :( Moving on to the actual review.<br />The quad is a decent one. I have been flying quads for a couple months now, and have flown everything from a hubsan to a DJI Phantom II, and this quad is almost exactly inbetween. Camera is more of a 480p than a 720p, but it still takes pretty decent pictures. Range was only about 150ft so I purchased a 2.4GHz wifi antenna and soldered it to the controllers board, bringing the range to about 500ft. which was more than exceptional for this quad. It was advertised with a 2GB Microsd card, but came with a 4GB Class 8 one, which i filled on my first day of flight. Rotor guards are mainly for indoor flight, and only add weight and lessen flight time when flying.<br /><br />3/5 because the charger did not last more than 7 charges, props come off too easily, landing gear got trashed after a couple (soft) landings. Other than those details I would rate it a 4/5 quad. Very good for beginners. And for those of you who want a fast quad, i tested the speed on it, it will fly at a fastest speed of 35 Mph (56.3 Kmh) in high speed, and 12 Mph (19.3 Kmh) in low speed, (tested by flying it in front of a car with someone keeping an eye on the gauges)",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AF2ICL4WAS36C4QK3IRFO43RHV7A,1431362180000,1,True
1157,5.0,Incredibly Durable!,"I'm not usually one to write reviews regularly, but this definitely deserves a review.  I really liked this from the get-go.  Sure it's a very budget friendly drone so I didn't expect too much but the reviews were quite good so I decided to give this one a try.  As with any device like this there is a learning curve to flying it, but not so much that it seems an impossible task.<br />I did however get a bit too ambitious my second day out and had it up about 60-70 feet off the ground in the back parking lot at work.  While I was trying to avoid power lines, I ended up in the top of a tree!  It was up entirely too high to try to retrieve it so I resigned myself to the fact that it was a goner.  If that wasn't enough to sink my spirits, a rain storm came and it poured for hours.<br />Well well well, I come to work two days later and find my drone has fallen from the tree and IS IN ONE PIECE!  I take it inside, plug in a new battery and IT STILL WORKS!  UNREAL!  A very deserved 5 stars!  Highly recommend for kids to learn on as it is very affordable to replace, and for adults who just want to act like kids but don't want to blow their paychecks on the fancy gear.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEKDEDMH7GNYOIZOFL2EEVVEEHQA,1467832181000,0,True

1162,2.0,Poor Reliability,"As a beginner in the quad copter I've purchased the Syma X5C based on reviews I've heard. It is quiet easy to assemble, synchronize and you're ready to fly immediately. The reliability of the item is questionable in my opinion. after several minuets of flight the copter bumped into the wall and stopped responding immediately. at first glance I suspected it may be the battery but after fully charging the battery for an hour plus I plugged it back to the copter and it wasn't turning on. opening the quadcopter case I realized several cold soldering, unstable connection of the PCB to the copter base and that the wires that connects to the ON/OFF switch were disconnected from the switch and thus the copter couldn't turn on. I soldered the wires back to the switch and the copter turned ON and flew without any issue. Two days later one of the motors stopped working so there wasn't enough power for the copter to elevate above ground level. To summarized I would say that the copter reliability is poor and fixing can be time consuming.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEZQ7GLOIORF36LGCQWGPCJZIETA,1435817875000,0,True

1166,4.0,One of Two Is Great,"If we're talking about this drone only focusing on the one which works, then 5 stars.  If we include the other one (which was this order), then it's 3 stars.<br /><br />Backstory: I ordered this quad to replace another which just didn't fly as I had hoped.  This one met my expectations and was a blast.  Then I got the same one as a holiday gift.  &#34;Two is better than one!&#34;  So I kept both.  Not a week later, while doing some indoor flying, this quad landed softly on the couch, and that was it.  Upon trying to lift off, one of the motors was dead, so it could only scamper around the couch, never gaining altitude.  Amazon honored a return and I was back down to one.<br /><br />The one I still have is great.  It is light enough you don't need FAA registration, though I did it anyway.  It's also small enough that it can be used comfortably indoors with the stability needed to go outdoors as well.<br /><br />Flight: I got used to flying on the Syma X11, so this was a step up, but not entirely new.  The remote for this seems to work better with the larger size, though they are interchangeable.  On slow mode, it is sluggish on turns and banking (pitch), but great for learning.  You may have some trouble in a light to moderate breeze, since it just won't pitch enough to compensate.  High speed mode makes for a fun flight.  It takes an aggressive angle and can hit impressive speeds.  Banking turns become an adventure.  For stability, make sure to calibrate it indoors until it hovers in a single spot.  Bonus: The remote remembers this setting, so each reset comes back already calibrated.  For outdoor flight, I'd say you can comfortably control it up to about 12 MPH winds.  Beyond that, you're at the whim of Mother Nature.<br /><br />Night and dusk flying are the best.  The lights on the bottom are bright and telling (red in front, green in back).  You can easily track it with these and maintain orientation (no headless mode).  The lights blink rapidly if the quad loses signal, and I'm not certain what it does at this point, as I'm typically running at it to re-establish connection.  Which leads me to...<br /><br />Range: I wasn't happy with the range, so I followed one of the many modification videos and added some length to the remote's antenna.  Now, it gets about 100 meters horizontal range.  That's good enough to have to squint to see it in daylight as well as fly it high enough where it looks like a dot.  Since it doesn't have FPV or GPS, I wouldn't want it going much further.  My main concern was losing signal in regular use.  After the mod, that is a rare event.<br /><br />Durability: As I said, one of them didn't fare so well, as one motor kicked the bucket after a soft landing on a couch.  The other quad has taken a beating and done just fine.  Once, it took a swim in some marshes after a loss of signal situation (see why I did the mod?).  When I reached it, one rotor was submerged, along with the camera and battery compartment.  I removed the battery, opened everything up and let it sun dry for the entire day.  After reconnecting everything, it all worked.  Don't drop it in a marsh.  With the prop guards on, it doesn't care much about hitting things and the rotors have had their share of abrasions from flips, trees, and ceiling brushes.  Just some aesthetic damage, but no change in flight characteristics.<br /><br />Battery: With the stock battery, I timed an outdoor flight.  It was moderately aggressive flying, with some use of the video camera.  The quad landed itself with a dead battery after 9 minutes, 16 seconds.  Not bad.  However!  Most other drones give you a low battery warning.  This gives you a dead battery warning, which means it falls out of the sky as the lights blink slowly.  I've noticed that about a minute before battery depletion, it starts to lose some lift performance.  Consider that the time to land.  Waiting can put you in a precarious position.<br /><br />Camera: Another reviewer made a great point.  They said that if you spent $50 on a video camera, you'd be disappointed with the quality.  Well, this one also flies.  So take it as you will.  The quality is about equivalent to mid-late-2000s cameraphone.  It is 720p resolution, but it records in Motion JPG, so you'll need to convert to do anything with it (and it takes up a ton of space as-is).  The dynamic range isn't great, so if you are looking at sky, ground is dark, at ground, sky is washed out.  Like I said, it's good, but not great.  Don't compare to a GoPro.  You know it's recording because a red light blinks on the camera module (it's green when powered and waiting).<br /><br />Carrying capacity: I pulled an envelope through the house tied on with a string, and I'm sure it will do grapes, but if you're asking about a GoPro, the answer is no.<br /><br />Conclusions: While I save up for a high-performance GPS-based drone, this is a great trainer and entertainment device.  It flies anywhere, and once you get the hang of the controls, you can maneuver it to within centimeter precision.  The camera is fun for what it is.  After doing some basic modifications, range is good.  For the price, I'd encourage you to get one.  You'll enjoy it.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AH7DKAXOKXSJ4A7O33TF74VLEQJQ,1456347909000,3,True

Controls are easy to use and the range is good. Controls have low and high sensitivity setting, great for beginners. The manual is slightly unclear and includes a gray box as a bit of an afterthought for the initial switch-on, not that clear on the procedure. Switch on the controller handset, have the copter sitting still and level on a flat surface then power it up with the switch- it takes a few moments to calibrate its gyroscopes before it's ready to go. If you hold it in your hand it'll either not calibrate or take a very long time then need to be trimmed on the controller to fly level. It does do very well to keep itself upright.

1245,4.0,Best Drone for the money......IF you start slow and practice low.(I made that up myself),Lost 3 SYMA X5C-1 drones so far and just got my forth one. That tells you how much fun they are to fly and how frustrated I am with losing control of them. I had wanted a drone for a long time but just waiting to &#34;pull the trigger&#34;. Saw they were on sale for $23.99 so I couldn't pass that up after reading many good reviews. The price has gone up since then from 23.99 to 28.99 and now 36.99. Dont know the reason for the increase in prices but still as good a drone as I have seen even at that price EXCEPT for one problem. As many many reviews point out they can be difficult to control especially in 5+ mile an hour winds which is most of the time once you get 50-100 feet off the ground. It's really hard to tell if it's because they fly out of range of controller or the wind takes them out of range or even a combination of factors including variability in the way the drone performs randomly beyond of your control.<br />The first one I know I started too fast going up near the limit of range available. I tried to really limit what I did and how high I went on the next two but one of the main reasons I got a drone was to take video from above trees of scenes otherwise out of sight. I don't even use the prop guards and have multiple crashes and no broken props which they come with spares for anyway. Lack of guards may be related to &#34;burning out&#34; motors (which are not brush-less) but so far have not had any drones long enough to burnout a motor and replacement parts seem cheap enough.<br />The best tip I have learned is to not be afraid to take the throttle stick straight down and kill props anytime you are getting close to trees or other potential problems. You can push the stick right back before it hits the ground in free fall and go up again or just let crash as I have many times with no damage(Sometimes it will knock the battery door loose or the Micro SD card loose but easily solved if you just check it each time you fly it. The next best tip is just PRACTICE as much as you can at low altitude before going up higher. I will follow up this review if I find the &#34;loss of control&#34; is not just my inexperience or a random flaw in product. I would have given 5 stars except for that one issue.

Beginners and semi advanced pilots will both have a great time with this one. I also fly a DJI P3. Obviously this is nothing like that. The camera is lacking severely, but not why I got it. In fact, I took my camera off and just plug the battery in with no cover. I also removed the landing gear since there are already guards under the props. I recently picked up a LaTrax Alias clone as well and while it is also a fun and more advanced acrobatic flyer, this X5C is really just as fun.

1270,5.0,Great introductory  quad to learn to fly on.,"This was a replacement since the first one had to be sent back due to it being used and missing the battery charger cable. When I opened this one it was quite obvious the last one had been opened and used just by the packaging alone. This one was neatly packaged and secured with zip ties and the screw driver and card reader were taped to the packaging neatly under the transmitter. The spare blades were taped to the bottom of the package . The SD card wasnot under the transmitter and was found in the camera which was connected unlike the first product I received.<br /><br />Other than being sent a used product with missing parts the product has exceeded my expectations. It is well worth buying to learn how to fly quadcopters.<br />I do suggest buying some upgraded battery packs such as 3.7v 720 ma, The longer flight times are well worth it. Also buying a charger that can charge more than one battery pack at a time will also make your flight time more enjoyable.<br />The lights on it are bright enough for night flying and do help with orientation but I did paint the prop guards and props up front yellow to help me out.<br />While I didn't buy this for the camera I was pleasantly surprised by the picture and video quality. I'll be honest though the camera will spend more time off of the quad than on it.<br />The transmitter is a a bit too small for my hands but not uncomfortable however I am coming from a full size RC transmitter for aircraft.<br />It does have enough power to penetrate light wind and what I mean by this is if you are hovering and the wind is pushing the quad you can angle the craft and return it to you.<br />Its a nice size for playing in confined areas like flying through carports around dumpsters, trees and around second storey porch supports and under lifted 4x4 trucks.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eDoy5leiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eDoy5leiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eDoy5leiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wDAvL4MVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wDAvL4MVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wDAvL4MVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cbMvzIqdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cbMvzIqdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cbMvzIqdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHI7AFZ4W62JM5QBHO3TUXVOMVXQ,1455718168000,1,True

It was completely fine, and flew perfectly once we charged it back up...  only this time, inside with much more care.  It takes a few flights to get controls down, you really need to practice them a lot so you can react quickly when things happen during flight.  We practiced hovering a lot, flying through doorways, and landing on tables/books/etc.  Control is really good once you get the hang of it.  I've read the X5C-1 is even better, so I *may* need to get one for myself.  It taken a few hard crashes and it's been fine.  A few times I thought the propellers would break, but it's been fine.

1305,4.0,Always wanted one of these but didn't want to spend big bucks!,"We have had this quad-copter drone for a while now and for the price, you can't beat it.  It's easy, yet a little tricky to fly at first.  With practice it gets much easier.  We have sent this so high that we could barely see it, and captured some great video.<br /><br />Speaking of the video - it's not HD, but for fifty bucks or so you can't really expect it to be.  If you're ok with non stabilized and sometimes shaky or blurry video, you'll love this thing!  Still images are so low res that they look like the oil painting effect you can do in Photoshop.<br /><br />Shortly after we got this we also purchased a set of 5 batteries and a 5-battery charger here on Amazon.  This makes for much more satisfying flying since you don't have to be done after such a short time.<br /><br />Some minor issues we have had were after flying through several batteries and getting what we thought was going to be some amazing videos we found that nothing was recorded on the included micro SD card.  Bummer!  It may have not been seated good for some reason because it worked during subsequent flights.  Flying in windy conditions is especially challenging since it doesn't have all the location sensors and computing power of the big birds, but as long as you're not flying among trees you should still be ok.<br /><br />For outside use we took the blade protectors off - they're like little hooks and get you stuck in trees very easily!  We have made many hard landings, clipped tree trunks and branches, but we haven't broken a blade yet.  It comes with a spare set of 4 for when that does happen though.<br /><br />When you get higher up in the sky it's sometimes difficult to tell which way it's facing - even with the colored LEDs.  We plan on painting half of ours a bright color to make it more obvious.  Otherwise you start pushing and pulling the sticks every which way to try to figure it out and can lose control of where you're going.  It would be nice to have a &#34;Home&#34; button for this reason, but again - at this price that's not possible.<br /><br />The controller is kind of a joke with many fake buttons on it. It also has an LCD screen that shows you in real time how far and which direction you're pressing the control sticks.  While flying, you certainly don't have time be looking down at the screen!

It crashed many number of times but the little flyer held up pretty well without breaking a single blade, blade guards or landing gear!<br /><br />Ok, so why the 4 stars? Here are the reasons:<br /><br />1. The supplied battery will give you only 5-7 minutes of flight time - You're out of playtime by the time you get into the groove!<br />2. The battery gets real hot - so don't plug it in to be charged as soon as you pull it out of the flyer!!!!!<br />3. With the camera mounted, the battery compartment has very little area where you can get your fingers around to slide the cover off to install or remove the battery<br />4. As a result, you may not have secured the battery cover back in correctly - Consequently for me, when the drone landed a bit heavy, the battery cover swung open exposing the battery - Make sure that you secure the cover properly<br />5. Grammatically poor instruction manual - It is complete,  just poorly worded!<br /><br />OK, but why still 4 stars? Why not 3?<br />Reason is that most of these issues (except the manual) have workarounds. I don't think it's fair to bash this awesome little flyer for any of the reasons above.<br />1. You can *almost* triple the flying time by dismounting the camera - I was surprised how much difference this made.<br />2. This makes dealing with the battery compartment cover easy<br />3.

This is a blast to fly without stress.<br /><br />UPDATE - Lost my X5C by flying to high, with too much wind. Caution. These are awesome in a light wind, but the X5C is so light that it can  keep going if it gets up high and out of range of the transmitter. Cutting the throttle and even turning off the tx didn't stop mine from flying off into the sunset. Very BAD not knowing where it came down or might have hit. The range of these little quads is shortened if your flying in your neighborhood surrounded by houses. And the wind is a bit stronger above. Pick a very large open area and you can get almost 3/4 the length of a football field in range. Beyond 50 yrds, anything could happen.<br />Just received my replacement and i still highly recommend as a starter quad.

1326,5.0,Super fun starter drone!,"Seeing more and more drones around, I wanted to try flying one but not spend hundreds of dollars. There have been occasional panic landings, a couple of bumps into tree trunks, and so forth but the drone just takes the punishment and keeps on going. Definitely recommend starting out in a big open field and using the prop guards while you learn! Be gentle with the controls and mindful of which way the drone is pointed, try to keep the green lights facing you. With practice you can fly pretty fast, circle around trees, do flips, or just hover really high, whatever you like. It has enough power to handle at least light wind. Not surprisingly, it is more responsive without the camera. The camera comes with a micro sd card installed and takes fair pictures. It's fixed in place and no FPV so there's some guesswork and luck involved, plus color rendition seems a little off; still, it's good enough to have fun with. And you'll want more batteries. I bought one extra 500mAh with it but that's still not enough flying time - I should have gotten an additional kit with multiple batteries and charger right off the bat.<br />Five stars doesn't mean it's the world's best drone, but for the price I am really pleased with the X5C.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEIVUMIX2TQCR7NU6JMVTDWWOUVA,1505619344379,4,True

1365,5.0,Excellent first drone!,"This toy drone exceeded my expectations given the price. I highly recommend this as a first drone.<br /><br />Some negatives that you should be aware of:<br />- it, strangely, does not fly against low speed winds. It hovers and flies in the wind, just not directly against it. Seems like a software bug because the drone seems to be powerful enough. And if you take it close enough to ground (may be because wind breaks so close to ground), it will fly against the wind. In that, its not a very powerful outdoors drone.<br />- camera gives poor quality pictures. Most likely you will not find pics worth printing or displaying in a digital frame. You might feel better about the video though as most of us are accustomed to lower quality web video! I'm currently looking for camera upgrade and found 808 No. 16 V3 480p camera recommended at some websites/chat forums. Haven't tried the upgrade yet.<br /><br />Despite the negatives I give this drone 5 stars because it is a fun drone!<br /><br />I fly it with blade guards on. The guards have been damaged during numerous falls and crashes but I scotch tape the spokes back to original strength and it's back in action! I have flown it indoors in tight spaces and outdoors in parks. My five year old son also likes to fly it. I got a pack of four batteries so that I do not have to worry about charging batteries when we are at a neighborhood park. :)<br /><br />It's an excellent first choice to get started with drones.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFODG7WLH3H6FDBPSDV4HUDMFFHA,1492375905000,1,True
1366,5.0,"Great, cheap little introduction to the world of drones, that anyone can learn to fly.","This is the first drone I flew, and for the money, it’s fantastic. If you leave the legs and prop guards in place it will run into a building or the ground and just bounce. My 11 year old flys this now and if he gets into trouble, he just cuts the power and lets it drop onto the grass, though I wouldn’t do it on concrete.<br /><br />Cons - the range is garbage. You will be lucky to get it to 60 or 70 meters out without losing contact, and when it does lose contact, it keeps going.<br /> Flight times are around 5 to 6 minutes per battery. And the batteries aren’t the easiest thing in the world to change out. I upgraded to longer flying batteries, and maybe got another 1.5 to 2 minutes per battery. Flight times (speed and maneuverability) increase if you remove the prop guards, legs and camera.<br /> You can tell it’s cheaply made. The plastic is weak, and the plug in for the battery feels like it’s flimsy, but so far, mine is in one piece... it also means that it bounces and it inexpensive to replace if you do break it.<br /> The camera is....ok. It takes photos and video, but honestly. With no gimbal or vibration dampener, video is shaky at best. I remove the camera, (legs and prop protectors too) and just blast it up and down the fields.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a cheap little bundle of fun to introduce anyone to the world of drones.

Survived PLENTY of badd crashes and still hasn't lost a beat. Few tips though:<br /><br />1. Only keep the camera mounted if you plan on using it. It will fly longer without it.<br /><br />2. Try to fly it with absolutely minimal wind as possible when you start to learn how to control it. L mode is recommended.  The H mode will make it more nimble,  but also easier to crash initially.<br /><br />3. Don't be afraid to fly it hard. I flew it on a windy day and it got away from me and smacked on the concrete hard. Damage? A tinyyy scratch. Have some fun ;)<br /><br />4. Careful about letting it cool down before you charge it again. The charger/battery will overheat if you are using it back to back.<br /><br />Once again... Best purchase on Amazon.

Charged up the now dry battery, and remarkably it worked again, although one of the propellers had been damaged from the fall.

1459,5.0,This is a great place to start if think you might be interested in quadcopters,"Let me start this review by saying that if you have never owned a quadcopter before, please do yourself a favor and start off with something like this rather than a DJI Phantom or other expensive drone. This is a great way to learn the basics of flying something like this without risking hundreds or thousands of dollars every time you take flight. You will crash when you're first starting out. You will get it stuck in a tree at some point. If you're flying a copter that costs 45 bucks, you can easily replace it or buy cheap replacement parts and be back in the air without it costing hundreds or thousands of dollars. When you feel like you've mastered something like this, then you can starting thinking about something bigger and fancier.<br /><br />This is a very easy to fly quad, stable and fun. You can get a 4 pack of additional batteries for about 20 bucks (highly recommended, you only get 5-7 min of flight out of a charge). It's also quite durable, I've crashed it a couple of times and got it stuck in a tree once, with no noticeable damage. The addition of the camera is nice too, just keep your expectations reasonable, you can get this for under fifty bucks so the camera is nothing amazing. You are not going to get the beautiful, stable, panoramic shots that you see some people posting on youtube. Those are taken by drones starting at about 600 bucks. This camera is not stabilized at all, every adjustment you make in flight will cause the camera to shake. Filming also cuts your flight time way down, probably only four minutes or so. The range on this quad is also going to be a lot more limited, it starts getting less responsive around 150 feet away, so I wouldn't fly it a whole lot further than that.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if you're interested in getting into quads/drones, this is a great place to start. It's a stable, good flying quad with a camera on it for some added fun.

If you want to see a picture of the top of your house it will work. But if you're trying to take an impressive aerial photo, this is not what you're looking for. My main difficulty in flying it is the fact that all four sections look identical except for the lights. During the day you can't see the lights so it's hard to keep track of which direction it will go. I might try marking them with colored tape. I also wish it could fly more than seven minutes.

If you have to change the blades out remember which direction they came off because they need to go back on the exact same way other wise it wont lift off the ground and you'll be scratching your head trying to figure it out best thing to do is keep the box around and line up the warning labels exactly like they are on the box picture. This thing will get up pretty far in the air and in a hurry but be advised it only weighs about 3oz (this also means it is not required to be registered with the FAA only 8oz or more have to be) so if a gust of wind happens at say 75ft off the ground it will quickly disappear into the distance. if this does happen don't try to recover as it normally will keep pushing farther away just kill the throttle and go look in the area where you think it landed. You might also want to look into a TILE which you can then attach to the copter and it will help you locate via Bluetooth on your phone. Hope this helps out!

1507,5.0,More than twice as good as the X11C,"I got the X11C as a gift. It was a decent copter that was fun, until I broke it. I wanted to stay with the Syma line since I was familiar with the controls, so I went one step up to the X5C. The X5C is much better in almost every way.<br /><br />Stability - This this was stable from first take off. I know that I can attribute some of this to experience, but also the much wider base helps a lot. I was able to hover it in place right away. And when I brought it out to the wind, it handled much better that the X11C. Some gusts were still pushing it, but not as wildly.<br /><br />Sound - The sound of this is a much lower pitched fan type sound. This is much appreciated after the higher pitch sound of the X11C.<br /><br />Controls - The controls are just about the same, just a different control design but same basic buttons. This controller has an LCD which is a cool novelty, but doesn't add that much value. The one thing I wish it would show is the quad's battery level, but instead it shows the controller battery level.<br /><br />Camera - I think this is the exact same camera as the X11C. At least the inside. 2MP, which produces barely useable images and video. It's fun, but nothing that will impress.<br /><br />Battery life - This is about equal as the X11C. This copter uses a bigger mAh battery, which is because it draws more power, so the end result in fly time is about the same. The extra batteries I got for the X11C fit in here, but are lower capacity, so only last about 6 minutes. But I have 3 of those, plus the battery that came with this, so I have nearly a half hour of fly time before recharging.<br /><br />Others - Some other nice things inlude a closed in battery compartment (not more battery wires hitting the blades), stronger blade guards (hopefully they don't break as easily), an on off switch, and landing gear for a softer touch down.<br /><br />Sure, this doesn't have those fancy headless or return home type features, but I didn't really want to pay that for a toy I like to fly around a couple times per month.<br /><br />End verdict, I am super happy.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AE44V2YPE5L3744VKGQLYXRFIZTA,1465646570000,1,True

1510,5.0,So easy your Mother can fly it,"I've never seen a quadcopter let alone use one. I decided on this one since it was the least expensive model with an &#34;HD&#34; camera. The batteries and parts are cheap and accessible. Originally I put the UDI 818A in my cart but when I went to add extra props, nobody stocks these, Amazon or otherwise. The all get shipped out of China and since I saw my friend bust up a bunch I knew they had to be more accessible than 2-5 week shipping.<br /><br />Got the copter at 6:30p and was flying it by 7p in my living room. It was so darn easy and stable! Took it out on my SMALL front lawn at night and let it hover there as well. Even my wife took a turn and had no problem with it. This model has to be as easy as it comes when it comes to flying.<br /><br />The next morning I took in the middle of the street, got the camera to work and it was super easy to fly. Absolute joy.<br /><br />Took it out to a local football field the next day. A bit windy and it was tougher to control.  Not sure what the breeze was but I'd have to guess it was a good 10mph+. So it had some issues as you've no doubt seen other reviews talk about. One it hit a certain point and altitude it kind of took off on its own and by the time realized it and I cut power, it was already almost 100 yards away. My depth perception obviously sucks as I thought it was much closer. Remember, I'm on a football field so it's already premeasured.<br /><br />Got it out this morning in calm air and what a joy to fly. Took it out of Low mode and put it in High mode and you could tell a nice difference. Very responsive, very quick.  I measured the distance where I could have it take off from the ground. 65 yards. The joy of being on a football field!  Once it's in the air I could probably give it some input another 10-20 yards before it was non responsive.<br /><br />Flight time on 650mAH batteries (it comes with a 500mAH), with the camera on was probably about 7-8 minutes. With the camera attached, but not on, plus the prop guards, I'd say that time might be about 10 minutes. So the camera didn't seem to bog it down much.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're looking for an entry quadcopter, you shouldn't go wrong with this model.<br />[[ASIN:B00MNG37C2 Syma X5C Explorers 2.4G 4CH 6-Axis Gyro RC Quadcopter With HD Camera]]",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGDBBKZREFZRGYJ3U4NJK3GAMOKQ,1446320548000,0,True

When you switch into high mode and remove the blade guards and camera it's got a decent bit of speed. The motors aren't powerful enough to really hurt you if you're thick headed and like to grab it in flight or fly it near someone (though it does hurt).

1522,1.0,Fun while it lasted..,"It was fun for the 3 flights that I had it... I received a far superior parrot bebop for xmas and after reading the horror stories of out of control, lost or crashed drones, I decided I wanted something cheaper for my first drone. So, it was returned and I bought the Syma X5C instead.<br />My first few test flights were outdoors in no wind conditions. I kept it a few feet off the ground and just tried to learn how to maneuver it around my back yard. The syma is quick and responsive. The video is shaky and the photos are about what you would expect from a cheap camera. Regardless, I wanted this for learning.<br />My third flight was in a minimal breeze situation. Still not sure what really happened.. but, I throttled it up to about 4 feet off the ground to hover. Then all of the sudden, it darted up about 15 feet. I let off the throttle and it didn't seem to respond. A few seconds later, I was staring at my syma drifting up and over the trees next door at about 30-40 feet. The throttle was off, I tried to turn, move forward, back and nothing was happening. I took my eyes off it for a few seconds to see if the remote still had connection. It showed connection.... That's when the sound from the props stopped. I looked backup... It vanished. I have no idea if it went higher, crashed into the tree, darted off, or what. I checked with the neighbor, checked his yard, stared up at the tree for a while, looked on his roof.. nothing. It has vanished. I am about 50% sure it is buried in that oak tree, but cannot see it.<br />My first emotion was total embarrassment as I had to bang on the neighbors door and tell him I lost my toy. After that, it was kind of comical that I just threw away $50+..<br />I am not really sure what happened and why I had no control. But I will probably not attempt to throw away $50+  on one of these again. It was a cool toy for the brief time I owned it.

This means you may lose it. I was flying mine over 100 meters from a lake, the unit went out of range as it caught a gust of air, flew over the lake and went in the drink. That's after stripping it down with no blade guards, etc. The next one I get will definitely have some homing firmware.

1531,5.0,Great Toy for the Money!,"This little guy is pretty awesome, especially for the cost. It has its flaws, but the fun to cost ratio is off the charts.<br /><br />Controls:<br />The controls took a bit of getting used to for me (I'm a beginner), but after playing with it for a couple of hours, I've gotten pretty good with it. The response is really quick and tight, almost overly sensitive. It seems like there a couple of different flying modes, depending on how you want to maneuver, but I'm not exactly sure what each one does because the instructions aren't especially clear on this.<br /><br />Material/Quality:<br />The build quality is not great, but then again, I've let it drop from about 30 feet in my yard and it was just fine. It's incredibly light, and made of a semi-rigid plastic. Because it's not too brittle, it's able to take some hits without shattering. The prop  blades are a bit more rigid/brittle, so the included guards are recommended. Extra blades were included with mine.<br /><br />Camera:<br />I really wasn't expecting much from the camera, but it takes surprisingly clear photos and videos. It's not a Go Pro, but it's not bad. The memory card and USB adapter for it feel really cheap, but they've worked every time so far. I do architecture/urban design work, so I'm excited to take some site photos.<br /><br />Battery:<br />The battery life is about 10 minutes. It charges quickly, maybe a full charge in a half hour? I'm not especially sure on this because the charging light on the USB adapter never seems to turns off. The connection between the USB adapter and the battery feels cheap, and I anticipate one part of it will break before too long. The connection between the battery and the drone seems kind of clunky and poorly designed as well. Again, this hasn't caused me any problems yet, but it seems like a potential point of failure. I will be getting a couple extra batteries soon so I can swap them out and keep flying.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a great starter drone with some really great features for the money.

1533,2.0,50% chance of getting an awesome quadcopter,"I purchased one of these and was very impressed with the quality of the quadcopter.  It had a great camera and was very responsive when flying.  When the battery approached a low level, the lights on the bottom would flash and I had about 30 seconds to land the drone.  I picked up a cheap micro SD card, since it did not come with one, and started capturing video.  The video was very clear and smooth.  Unfortunately, like most people’s experience, the drone soon ended up in the top of a tree.<br />Since I had such a great experience with this drone I quickly decided I would buy the same drone back.  When I received my second drone, I was surprised and happy to find that there was an SD card included in this one!  Unfortunately, that is the only positive I can say about it.  This drone is definitely a lot less  of a quality product.<br />- The included screwdriver would not work with the small crews.  I had to use the old screwdriver from my first drone – not that big of a deal, especially for a cheap included screwdriver<br />- The drone does not give a warning for a low battery.  It just drops out of the air.  I cannot control it and as it falls to the ground, the lights start flashing.  I don’t’ understand why it would behave differently than the other which was the exact same model.<br />- When I placed the SD card in my PC to watch the recorded video, I noticed broad lines running across the image.  These lines make waves through the image when the drone is in motion.  The video quality is awful compared to the first drone I had.  Again that doesn’t make sense since these are the same model of drone.| see the screenshots ( the shot in the snow is the second one i recieved, the other is from the first X5C i had)<br />If both drones were as good as the first one I had I would easily recommend this drone to anyone.  I was so happy with that drone I couldn’t see why people spend up in the hundreds for a drone, but I guess it come down to quality control.  If you invest in the Syma X5C, just know you have about a 50% chance of getting a lemon.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611xaOjN7hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611xaOjN7hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611xaOjN7hL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61taJBy9SeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61taJBy9SeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61taJBy9SeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHBWGQ7DQWBD5MRCVSMYVVXPAH7Q,1515872678205,1,True

1562,2.0,Xmas spirit crashed and burned.... YMMV!,"TL DR;  Cheap Quad copter that flies extremely well for the price - you just have to wonder how long the parts will last. 1 motor dead in under 30 minutes total time used. YMMV. This is something I really want to love but I am just not feeling it for now. I have submitted an exchange request. Hopefully the replacement lasts longer and I will bump the rating from 2 stars to 3 or 4.<br /><br />I got this quad as a present to myself. My wife last year got me a Syma 107 helicopter. It is fun but you could only really fly it indoors. I decided to try a quad. I bought this quad because of the reviews. So far, it has been a major disappointment.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Inexpensive<br />- Flies well<br />- specs said 2GB card but I received a 4GB so it looks like I got an upgraded X5C-1<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Atrocious manual (I had a heck of a time figuring out how to get video to work. See note below what I learned...)<br />- Parts will literally fall off in flight (had one led lens cover just fall off) PITA factor to replace<br />- major durability concerns - 1 motor dead in under 30 minutes of non-continuous use!!!<br />- camera angle is poor<br /><br />NOTES ON VIDEO:<br /><br />Setup is fairly intuitive. Knowing how to get video is not. I am one of those people who will actually RTFM first, search Google second, and ask on a forum third. The manual has the grammar level of a toddler. Page 9 on the manual: &#34;Get to know take photo and video&#34;. Nice Engrish. The general is idea is conveyed there but this is this directions to take video &#34;Make sure camera normally work , when pull the button 'C' down , camera starts to take video after a beep from the transmitter and the GREEN indicator on camera will change to RED than keep flashing&#34;.<br /><br />Grammar errors aside, it overlooks two critical items. The LED is *INSIDE* not *ON* the camera. It is not visible in daylight conditions. Also nowhere in the manual does it state where to find this LED. Additionally it also mentions to pull but we would say push down on the C button again to stop video. You absolutely *MUST* do this or you will get zero size video files that will not play. So do not forget to do this or you will lose your video.  The manual is pretty close to useless in learning the finer points of using the quad. This quad flies outdoors extremely well and pretty smooth; even in mildly windy conditions. Compared to my heli, the quad is far more responsive and faster. With the heli, even the most minor breeze would cause it to crash. Ironically this quad isn't good to fly indoors because it flies too fast unless you have a ridiculously large house with an open floor plan. I do not.<br /><br />One last item on video. The camera angle is poor. If you are moving forward at any appreciable speed you will be taking video or a picture of the ground. With a little modification, this can be easily fixed.<br /><br />Pearls of wisdom in case you purchase:<br /><br />If you are a noob like me, I highly recommend flying this with the blade protectors on. It will reduce flying time a little but will provide some insurance in case you crash. Trust me, you will crash. I also recommend flying this in a field with grass away from trees; like a high school football field. The range of the unit is approximately up to 30m. I would also strongly recommend flying it no higher than 30 feet until you get very comfortable flying the unit. Crashing from 1-2m is not as bad as crashing from 30m.<br /><br />Also if you do fly it higher, it becomes really difficult to control. The LEDs underneath attempt to provide visual orientation of the quad but during the day you cannot see them. If it is 10-20m up and a gust of wind hits you can easily lose control and send it out of range pretty quickly.<br /><br />That being said, I also recommend purchasing spare part kits, extra batteries, and a multi-port charger. Prior to opening this christmas day, I already purchased a 5 port charger by Holy Stone [[ASIN:B00QHUONLE Holy Stone 5-in-1 Max 2.5a Current Input Fast Battery Charger for X5c,udi 818a,x1,hubsan X4,hs170,x400,f181,f180 Quad]][[ASIN:B00QHUONLE Holy Stone 5-in-1 Max 2.5a Current Input Fast Battery Charger for X5c,udi 818a,x1,hubsan X4,hs170,x400,f181,f180 Quad]] and six extra LiPo batteries. Unfortunately, the 6 batteries I got are not currently available on Amazon. I have yet to review them but so far I would give them 5 stars. They're Morpilot and rated 3.7V LiPo 720mA 20C [[ASIN:B016BDALIU Morpilot® 6pcs 3.7V High 720mAh 20C Lipo Batteries for Syma X5C X5SW X5SC X5A X5]][[ASIN:B016BDALIU Morpilot® 6pcs 3.7V High 720mAh 20C Lipo Batteries for Syma X5C X5SW X5SC X5A X5]]. Look for a similar rated battery &#62;500 mAh and &#62;20C. The 20C rating has to do amount of current the battery can provide.<br /><br />Today, one motor just stopped working. Joy. My daughter was flying it for about one minute and landed it. She handed me the controller and I tried to take off. Boom, one motor stopped working as it was taking off and flipped over into the grass. I have filed an exchange with Amazon. I do hope the replacement lasts longer, and this was a fluke. My helicopter has tens of hours of use. So much so that I need to replace the battery because it has too many charge cycles.<br /><br />Overall if the motor had not failed I would have rated 3 stars. Star deductions for the abysmal manual, parts detaching in flight, and now the motor failure.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFYZ5SDPBAU7CHDITJJV47DUXHGQ,1451269705000,2,True

Whenever it is getting out of range, the lights blink letting you know so you either turn it around and bring it towards you or cut the power and let it drop to about 25 feet and give it the throttle.

I have had the drone for over a week and have been flying every day. Recommend you get extra batteries. My flight time per battery has been about 9 min and 30 sec. When you first start flying, try to get the drone to hover in one place and you will see it wants to drift from left to right or front to back. This is fine. What you need to do now is use the trim switches to get it to to stay more stationary which is very achievable. The drone flys very well for a cheap drone and can take a beating. I dont recommend doing this on purpose, but i have hit a tree at full speed and picked it up and kept flying. Have crashed it several times and just shakes it off and keep flying great. After a week i have removed the blade guards and i am flying like a pro. In the beginning, always fly with the green lights facing you so you dont lose your orientation with the controls. Later practice with the drone facing opposite so you can learn how to not lose orientation if the drone gets turned around. I am now upgrading to a DJI drone and i am having a blast.

I like that so many of the replaceable parts are affordable; motors average about $2.50 each. We noticed one motor seemed weaker than the others on our first outing, and before long (and after a day stuck in a tree), the motor didn't have enough torque to spin the rotor.  Replacement seems a little convoluted with so many screws to remove plus the need for soldering, but looks doable.<br />Additional batteries are a must, as each charged battery flies for about 7 minutes and takes at least 45 minutes to recharge.  The picture and video quality of the camera is surprisingly decent. I'm a bit flummoxed though that the video includes sound, which records only a very loud motor noise while it is in operation.<br />I suspect the quality of these units varies considerably from box to box, but since most of the parts can be replaced -and eventually will have to be anyway- you're only a few solders away from a like-new flying unit.

As long as you follow the instructions to sync the thing each time you fly. They have pretty impressive range that took me a few flights to work up the nerve to test out. I have put probably 10 batteries each through them today alone. I bought a few of the 6 packs of spare batteries and it was worth it. The only thing that went wrong was my son pressed in the cable to one of the batteries too hard and broke the plastic. I was able to disassemble it and super glue it back in place and it works fine. A lot of bad reviews here are probably Christmas day first flight mishaps... That said, I am not new to RC aircraft, so nothing about this surprised me. You can buy every single part to repair these here also. The body, blades, motors, even the control board. That is what sold me on this. My 12 year old is pretty good with his and we fly them both at the same time doing synchronous flips using the crazy flip function. The camera is a bonus to me and leaves a bit to be desired, but works good enough to document your flights.

1735,5.0,"Decent Quadrotor, Reasonable Price","I bought this as a sort of trainer for upgrading to bigger and better things, as I often find an aerial perspective useful in some areas of science. Below will follow a breakdown of the craft and it's capabilities.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Avionics: I recommend some experience with less advanced craft before hand. It's very good about keeping itself stable, and I was actually surprised at how well it could hover over one place without optically assisted position hold. It is reasonably capable of fighting a breeze, but I wouldn't want to fly it in a windstorm, definitely not in wind exceeding 10mph, but your average breeze really isn't going to affect it much.<br /><br />- Flight Characteristics: Overall, it's a very stable little craft. The electronics do much of the work, but a low center of mass, sturdy frame, and aerodynamic body help. I've never had a problem controlling this craft under normal conditions, and I don't expect to. Even without optical or GPS assistance, it's a tame machine when you need it to be, but it can also move in a serious way. For the price range, it's actually pretty fast.<br /><br />-Easy to Use: Your grandmother could fly this quad. No- seriously, it's insanely easy to fly. It comes ready to fly out of the box, fully assembled, and although the instruction manual is poorly translated, the controls are so simple that if you've ever flown another quad, you may well not need it.<br /><br />-Inexpensive: If you're looking for something to use as a trainer before moving up to something like a Phantom, this might actually be pretty close to as good as it gets before you exceed 100$, and it does a good job of being easy to control, while teaching you how to fly without the fancy sensor package.<br /><br />-The Camera: Now, originally, I was going to say this was a neutral aspect, but this is a drone that costs less than 50$, so the fact that it actually has a reasonably decent camera at all is actually pretty impressive. Overall, it's not a bad camera, but it's definitely not a good one either, but considering the price, I can't fault it. It actually takes really quite good photos, and I have taken it quite some distance into the sky to get some pictures of the landscape and they honestly don't look half bad. Video quality could be better. It can be a bit grainy, and it sometimes has the same issue with the craft vibrating as most quads in this price range do. With no gimbal suspending it outboard of the aircraft, it feels the same movements of the rest of the craft, and this means that it's really not the greatest. It works though, and all things considered it's not bad. You CAN take video with it, and it's usable footage, it's just not HD.<br /><br />-Parts: Parts for this craft are not hard to find, and it's a simple machine that's easy to repair. Exactly what you want if you've never done much RC flying and are just getting into it.<br /><br />Weight: This craft weighs in at just a bit over 100 grams all things included, WELL BELOW THE 250g LIMIT above which the FAA requires you to be registered. It also means it won't hurt much if you manage to crash it.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Battery Life: Ok, this really isn't that big of an issue since batteries for this craft are cheap and you can have as many as you like. My calculations show that it gets around 1 minute of flight per 71 mAh, and this will vary depending on how you have the quad configured. Minus the camera and the propeller guards, the camera, and detachable landing legs on the bottom, it gets significantly better flight time.<br /><br />-Range (Neutral Issue): Now, the seller says 50m and I know this is BS. Which is fine, because they didn't overestimate it, they underestimated it by quite a lot. I would call 50m it's safe range, beyond that, be very careful. I'm confident I've had it more than 100m away, but there was some serious bum clenching, because if you lose control at that range, your only real hope is to get it to the ground in one piece. I frankly don't see this as an issue, because there's no reason to fly a non-FPV quad much further than 100m, but I wish they would revisit this and tell me the exact range.<br /><br />Summary: Good quad, low price, not much else to say.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGUL35FDKA6JPXM47JULQSOP2UAQ,1469582635000,2,True

1739,5.0,So much fun!,"This drone is incredibly light but very stiff, about a foot in diameter and very sturdy and maneuvers quite well.  The radio works fine and the controller sticks are perfectly sensitive and didn't require any calibration out of the box. The on-off switch on the drone is really nice. The camera works really good. Don't expect to get wedding video quality from it, but it is fun to spy on your neighborhood.  If there is a light wind you can still fly it as long as you know how to compensate.  However on a windy day you won't be able to control it very well and you might never see it again.  When there is no wind the thing really cruises fast and if you take off vertically it goes like a rocket.  So much fun.  If you never flown one before just practice getting it to hover like at eye level and then work on making turns.  If you blast off the first time you fly it chances are it will go over someones houses and could potentially get stuck high up in a tree somewhere and you'll never see it again (happened to me).

1769,5.0,Awesome! Read this and then order!!,"I don't care how old you are, this is going to be some of the most fun that you've ever had if you've ever been into remote control toys. I got one for my 43rd birthday. I bought one for a buddy's 40th birthday. We absolutely love them! So, if you grew up with remote control cars, Slot Cars, toy trains, etc., then you are going to love this thing.<br /><br />It is very easy to learn how to use. Just don't go bananas your first time out! Start slow. Keep it low and go slow. Get to understand how it moves. There is a high performance mode and an easy mode. Start in the easy mode. It is fairly easy.<br /><br />Where it does get tricky though is the orientation. This rotates 360 Degrees. Once you start rotating, it throws your own mental coordinate system off. It does take a while to handle that so be aware. You get 2 times the height of your house up in the air, rotate 45 degrees and if you don't rotate with it, your mental coordinate system is off and you're going to find yourself chasing it down. Believe me. I've had to cross roads, jump fences, have awkward conversations with my neighbors and climb trees (resulting in even more awkward conversations with my neighbors) to go find mine.<br /><br />The video is awesome. No it is not a high-def Steven Spielberg movie quality video. But it is good quality video. You get high enough You Can See For Miles and Miles and Miles. You've never seen your neighborhood like this before and it is really cool to see.<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that this thing is extremely lightweight. Check the specs, I have no idea how much it weighs. But what can I can tell you is this, there is no stabilization that can help correct with the wind. It does not take a whole lot of wind to blow this thing around. It takes almost no wind, in fact, to blow this thing around. So, if it's Breezy, don't go too high or you're going to end up chasing it down.<br /><br />Would I buy that this again? Absolutely. Like I said, I bought it for a friend and when I destroy mine, I plan on buying another one. This is a fun toy for all ages and I think probably adult guys more than kids.<br /><br />Great as a starter tool if you want to get something more expensive and fancy. And for $40 bucks? Come on! $40 bucks doesn't buy you a whole lot of fun these days (at least not in my neighborhood).

The next flight, in an open field, went well and restored his confidence in being able to maneuver the craft. This was a grave mistake. The very next flight started from a clearing in the woods.

1776,4.0,Better Than Epected,"I got this a few days before my kid's birthday and didn't get to the minor assembly and testing until the night before.  I got behind a locked door and put the rotor protectors on.  I did  charge the battery as soon as I got it.  Tested it out in the room.  It gets to the ceiling very quickly on a full charge.  Learning curve is not bad.  It doesn't do well in anything more than a slight breeze and it goes pretty high.  I'm not good at steering it if it spins and try to keep the red lights pointed away from me.  It's  very fun to fly at night, but control gets more difficult as the battery wears down.  It has survived a few minor collisions with the house and bushes, trees and a few other items.  Still working well and my kid likes it almost as much as I do.  I got the 5 battery and charger deal and got a set of replacement blades.  Not sure I'll ever need those.  Extra batteries are a must.  Would be a very frustrating toy without them.  Camera seems like it would be tough to watch.  The drone bounces all over the place.  I shot some flight footage, but can't find anything on my phone or tablet to play it back on.  This is 100% toy and it's fun for kids and adults.  My kid is 12 and the suggested age is 14.  That seems pretty solid.  Watching my son fly that thing towards trees and rooftops might be preparing me for when he starts driving.  Can be pretty scary at times.  I have a rubber band on one of the front spokes that wraps around the battery cover/camera to keep it on during flight.  Rough landings can cause it to open up when you take off again.  Easy fix that doesn't detract from it.  Instructions are hilarious.  Poorly written in someone's third or fourth language.  Basically says that if you fly this thing and hurt yourself or others it's due to you own negligence.  Also seems solid from my experience  to date.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGHEUS4ZJEZX6QUKCEN7KWC3YB7A,1472361199000,0,True

1778,5.0,Still the best introductory quad for beginners and a lot of fun too!,"This light little quadcopter is the perfect introduction to quad flying for beginners and is an excellent quad for intermediate and expert flyers as well. It has a lot going for it because of the light weight, incredibly cheap batteries which give the owner 5 to 9 minutes of flight per battery and are easily swapped out to have an afternoon of fun flying the quad. The motors, props and spare parts are plentiful and it is incredibly easy to repair this quad. I keep a spare handy so that if I have problems, I can simply swap out the bad one and keep flying until I have time to repair the one needing to be fixed. Back to batteries: I keep a USB charger battery with me and charge batteries in the field to rotate them out (after letting them cool) so I can keep flying. It is a good idea to let the motors on the quad cool before taking the quad up again.<br /><br />For that first flight, it is a good idea to just run the motors in a low-spin for 5 minutes to break in the motors. And it pays to clean the props and check the gears and drive train to insure there are no rocks or dust in them before flight. Do NOT take off from dusty and rocky ground. Find a clean surface to take off from and to land on. Clean and inspect your quad before and after every flight and your motors and drive trains will last a lot longer. Compressed air is the best way to clean the drive train and do avoid using lubricants since the plastic gears really do not do well with sticky or even dry lubricants. Just keep the parts clean. Open the quad every ten flights of so to do a deep cleaning and inspect everything. And DO buy a crash pack with spare motors, drive trains and other parts. Trust me, you'll be glad to have one or two on hand.<br /><br />The only down side is that the camera is of extremely low quality and it makes sense to just put it away and use a 808 #16 camera as a camera to get decent video from the quad. I use a Velcro strap to secure mine to the base of the quad. The video will be a bit shaky but this is a perfect introduction to aerial video on the cheap. For those really wanting to explore aerial video without breaking the bank, get the Syma X8C that can lift some pretty hefty cameras and fly for a long time. The X5C can produce pretty good video as well for under $100. Just don't expect cinema quality. I'm exploring camera mounts to try to minimize jello on the videos and also to try balancing the props to insure as stable a flight as possible with the craft which means better video in the long run.<br /><br />I regularly fly my X5Cs without the landing legs since these weigh down the craft and waste battery. I have never used the prop guards. Truly battery wasting weight and of practically no use, except for indoor flight which I never do. I also remove the battery door as it is really not all that useful and it saves weight to have it off the quad. The batteries stay in just fine without the door. And the quad has better ventilation for the battery as a result (a good thing). The X5Cs are so light I've had them hit me and they cause no injury or damage. It still pays to fly safely, but these craft are extremely low-risk and are wonderful park flyers. I've had them fall from up to 50 feet up and land on grass with absolutely no damage. They are truly tough and resilient flyers.<br /><br />The X5Cs have been around for quite awhile and this single aircraft had many manufacturers rush to copy it. It's a classic and is still a very relevant and useful quad for teaching and casual flight in parks and the great outdoors. A lot of quad channels on Youtube featured it and some of my favorite videos of it are from a guy called Quadcopter 101. His videos on the X5C are excellent. There are fewer videos featuring the X5C these days, but make no mistake, this is a very good and well regarded quadcopter and is perfect for flight training and all around fun. I have two of them and they are still real favorites of mine that sit next to my two Phantoms and my heavy duty Hubsans on every trip out to the field.

The instructions say a range of 75 meters which is roughly 150 feet.  I hovered it up to about only 50 feet (close to the top of an old oak) and it lost the bind...  it kept going up until it was a dot...  I was a zero throttle and it kept going up.  At over 100 feet, the wind got it and pushed it down the street.  Finally after about 2 minutes of frantic attempts to rebind it, it completely shut down the motors and fell straight down.  I thought it was lost (only the 2nd flight) and I finally found it in another old oak.. 30+ feet up.<br /><br />Great for hovering around the house, or yard, but don't try anything crazy, and certainly don't put it in a climb over 50 feet.

I've crashed it countless times in the past few days and it hasn't failed me yet. I got it stuck in a tree, about 20 feet off the ground, during a night flight. A well placed football throw freed it from the branches with no visible damage from the ball or the crash to the ground. The controls were easy to learn with some helpful tutorials from YouTube and with some fine tuning I was able to keep it away from walls and trees with softer landings. The orange and green lights are helpful for pointing out the front and rear of the drone.<br /><br />A negative would be it's extremely light weight. Flying it with a strong wind can cause it to get away from you quickly. The flight time is around 7 minutes with the blade guards and camera attached. Removing them adds about 2 more minutes to the flight time. I ordered some extra batteries which you can find here on Amazon for really cheap. I haven't tried the camera yet as I wanted to be able to control it first before trying video.

1931,5.0,This drone is a great value for the price and has delivered exactly as ...,"This drone is a great value for the price and has delivered exactly as expected.Set-up is quick, but don’t expect much from the poorly written instruction manual. I think that watching a few videos online before trying to set it up and fly for the first time helped more than reading the instruction manual. Buy a few extra batteries. Flying at a park in very light wind, it is stable but does tend to drift a little bit. It has plenty of power to rise in altitude and will quickly get out of sight if you’re not careful. My 10 year old is learning to fly it, but expect children (and adults) to take some time getting used to controlling the RC if not already familiar with such things. The video camera is very good (again, considering the price) and it’s very easy to view the pics on a computer. No broken props yet, and everything is still working after about 10 flights. I would recommend starting outside (don’t try flying it for the first time in your living room unless you want to break it on day 1). Just learn one stick / control at a time. Up and down. Then up/down forward/back. Doing it this way, slowly, until you master it will ensure more flights and more fun before it disappears into the sunset or lands at the top of a tree. Lots of fun and planning to buy another one if/when this one flies off into the sunset.<br />3/27/16 Update: Still flying this drone after 3 months and maybe about 25 full battery charges. The weird thing is that I have never broken a prop or had any problems. I didn't expect it to last this long. I'm able to fly bank turns and whiz around the field with confidence. I'm also flying a Syma X-11 and in the process of building a hobby class FPV 250 class racer. Rather than waiting for calm days, I've taken it out in all conditions and have fun fighting the wind on breezy days. The way this drone is configured, it powers up hard in the wind and tends to gain a lot of altitude. It's very easy for this quad to gain A LOT of altitude which becomes a problem if you get disoriented and have trouble bringing it back. In those situations, I usually cut power hard, let it fall for a bit, then power up before hitting the ground so that it does not get away from me. The craziest thing happened at the school yard today when the wind took it seriously high. I cut power, let it fall maybe a hundred feet, then powered on and let it touch down in the distance. To more horror, it landed in an enclosed power transformer area on concrete and surrounded by a high chain link fence. But incredibly, it was upright and on it's feet. I powered up and flew right out of there - if it had broken or landed any other way it would be gone (but still in sight). Really a great craft to learn on!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AE3TO3PZFUZZ633DECIRCUO27MZQ,1451416359000,0,False

Your house will thank you for that.<br />*All the extra parts and batteries need a case, which go for around 35 bucks, again it is costing more money, but it makes it easy to take to the park.<br />*The stock range is crap on this quad, grab a 2.4 ghz wifi router antennae and solder it in the remote receiver. Doing this simple and cheap mod will double, if not close to triple the range.<br /><br />I tried to cover everything I have learned in the past 2 weeks, it has been a wonderful ride so far.

1976,5.0,"Tough drone: submersed in water, stuck in a tree for a year through Florida rain storms and a hurricane and it STILL WORKS!","This drone has been submersed in water and stuck in a tree for over a year and it still works...<br /><br />We bought this drone for my son for Christmas 2015.  That same day it fell into the lake and sunk to the bottom,  When I went into the lake, I could see the lights still on.  We did the bag-of-rice trick for a couple days and I was shocked to see it worked perfectly fine!  For the next several months we played with this drone and got it stuck in a tree, but was able to get it down.  Then in the spring of 2016 it was stuck way up high in a tree and we couldn't reach it.  So I bought another drone to replace it and we somewhat forgot about it, guessing it lost forever.  We'd check on it from time to time, especially after a hurricane came through our area, but it was hopelessly stuck.  Then in March 2017 I got an idea and was able to get it down from the tree.  It didn't work, so we took it apart and found the switch to be rusted. So we removed the switch and soldered the wires together and I was shocked to see the drone lights lit up!  We put the drone back together and it flew flawlessly as if it hadn't been stuck in a tree for over a year!  Next, we took the micro SD card from the camera and put it into the computer - it still worked! We have a nice video of me flying my son's drone into that tree!  For the final test: surely the camera wouldn't work after all that time in a tree, having gone through countless rain storms and a hurricane?!  But yep!  The camera still works perfectly fine.  So for a low cost drone, Syma knows how to make 'em.  We have two Syma drones and the kids race them and place with them together - which is another bonus: two drones can fly at the same time without the R/C signals getting mixed up.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AG677YXN55ZTIGPU2DEBX7ZXDBLA,1490955758000,1,True

I'm glad I bought the extra batteries, though.  This was my fist flying RC toy ever, so it took a little getting used to, but I think my experience with RC cars, plus flight simulators on the PC probably helped.  I ended up switching the controls to mode 2, which seemed a lot easier for me.  The picture/video quality is about what I expected.  It's much better outside or in well-lit areas.  I can't count how many times I've crashed this thing on my hardwood floors, and it keeps chugging along.  I did notice that one of the props now has too much movement up and down on it's axis, so I might need to fix that.  I'm not sure if a prop swap will fix that, or if I broke a different piece.

1979,5.0,Expectations Exceeded,"I'm pretty blown away by the price/performance ratio - it really exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I think this drone is great for beginners and can be used even after you are no longer a beginner.  It's very stable, light, and durable.  The &#34;web cam&#34; on the bottom is fine for playing around and many replace it with a better one later.<br /><br />The copter is well supported by the market with many options for replacement parts, cases and additional batteries.  All of these parts are reasonably priced.<br /><br />Durability is excellent.  We have crashed several times and the unit still looks and performs perfectly.  We are using the optional (and included) blade protectors which probably helped.<br /><br />This model does not have a &#34;headless&#34; mode (where the drone controls are simplified).  In &#34;normal&#34; (not headless) mode, the drone has a front, similar to an RC car and the controls are relative to the direction the drone is facing.  In headless mode, the drone has no concept of a &#34;front&#34; and forwards is always defined as the same direction relative to the remote.  Headless mode is nice for young children or users who are too casual to invest learning time.  In terms of learning to fly, headless mode has limited use in that it removes maneuvers that are possible with the normal control system.<br /><br />One additional caveat is that the larger size of this drone (large dinner plate) makes it less optimal for indoor flight.  You might consider getting this and another syma drone for this (such as the X12S) because the remotes are interchangeable between the two.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGSK5XRVSNVPIV2DPGRGOQL5JLAQ,1481572610000,4,True

The copter is sturdy enough and is still in good working order after quite a few flights and a couple of less-than-graceful landings.<br />The sometimes poorly-translated manual and the trim knob arbitrarily re-purposed as camera control button attest to the sacrifices that need to be made to meet the price point, but all in all this is a fun and worthwhile toy.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFYDXZ3TRFCG7DFSCZ3CWB2OT2ZQ,1455738480000,0,True
1985,4.0,Can't beat it for the price,"First, get this out of the way...you aren't going to compete with a DJI or anything like that for a drone that costs less than $50.  I've had this thing now for almost 10 months and it's been great.  The video and picture quality is not really that great, but it's good enough to have some fun with it.  I got extra batteries (Morpilot) that have a slightly larger capacity, and I stay airborne for 10min at a time.  If you take off the camera and prop guards, you can stay up for close to 15min.<br /><br />The drone handles pretty well, but in a reasonable wind, you will be fighting to keep it stable.  The range is pretty good, but if you look on YouTube, there's a controller hack that will increase the range to 300yds ( I did it and it works...you have to be comfortable soldering.)  But, even without the hack, you can easily get this thing up high enough it's difficult to see.  HOWEVER, if you do that, be prepared to possibly loose it.  The default when it looses signal is to basically fall out of the sky.  If you are in reasonable range of where it falls, you can re-bind the controller when it gets in range and then re-gain control.  But, if it's out of range, it will fall all the way to the ground pretty hard.  But, as I said to start, this isn't a DJI, and for the price, expecting return-to-home, and other such GPS style protections simply isn't going to happen.<br /><br />So, for the price, you really can't beat this thing.

2056,4.0,Great beginners drone.,"I am writing this six months after getting my first drone, the syma x5c! This is a great machine, and I would go as far as to day it is the greatest UAV for beginners out there. It flys great inside and out, does flips and rolls easily, and has two pitch settings so it doesn't get boring after a while. It is also extremely durable. However, There are some things that you should be aware of before buying this machine. It has pretty cheap construction, and sometimes soldering while break, requiring you to remove lots of small screws to fix it. The camera is 2mp, but is still pretty awful. It's for fun, and no more then that. Additionally, the motors are brushed, meaning that they will wear out after 7-12 hours of flight. With 8-10 minute flight times, this is a lot, but eventually your motors will burn out and you will be forced to make repairs or buy a new drone. Keep in mind that this industry is just getting started. In the next few years, we will see quadcopter and UAV technology become cheaper, better, and smarter. But for now, this is a relatively new industry. With that comes risk. This product has done a good job of taking away some of that risk, but I would not recommend going further then this in the hobby if you're not ready to make repairs and figure out how things work.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEN3VYS6OAYBRAQB2UCCGXKGXIPQ,1449719898000,1,False

It's gyro stabilized which makes it pretty easy to fly.  It's a bit big for indoor use and even perhaps backyard use.  Go find a big empty park or field to practice in.  I bought mine with the Tenergy 5 battery pack and after spending roughly an hour with six packs in the park, I was quite proficient at flying it around, doing flybys, and recording video.  The camera quality isn't very great; About like a cell phone from 8 years ago.  Still images leave a lot to be desired but the video isn't bad especially in bright sunlight.  The colors are a bit washed out.  You can easily fill the included 4GB microSD card if you have multiple batteries.  I use mine to inspect my roof and solar panels.  It has a beginner and expert flying mode which is great for learning.  Beware that it's maximum altitude is greater than the remote's range.<br /><br />So why 5 stars after noting the problems above? Well it's a low cost product.  It's not the best quadcopter out there by far, but for the money, I think it's an excellent value for an entry level person such as myself.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHK4GRHEOYVLVDVWEJ5SIRG4HYGA,1451466436000,4,True

They both seem like great drones although the hubsan was a clear winner for me.  The x5 is impressive because of it's size, but it is not nearly as quick and agile as the x4.  The x4 can also be flown indoors, where as the x5 is too large to really enjoy it inside.<br /><br />We had one major problem with this Syma x5 though, someone else near by was using a smaller syma x11 at the time, the x5 picked up the signal from that remote accidentally and took off uncontrollably.  After ascending to around 200ft, and flying off to by another 500+ feet, the LEDs went out so we lost sight of it and it fell to the ground about a quarter mile from it's original position.

I wasn't able to fly it well because of the wind, it did respond to the controls very well. The challenge is once it turns around like a 90 or 180, it's hard to figure out what way to steer. On a  flat calm non-wind day, it'd be perfect. I wasn't able to get the camera to work yet but I've only flown it once. The propellers are not overly dangerous which is good.

2134,5.0,My favorite platform to play on and a great choice for beginners,"The X5C was my first entry into quadcopters.  So many reviews existed comparing this cheap toy with much more expensive models so I decided to give it a shot.  This thing is a blast and it's extremely durable.  I ordered two as one was a gift and both are still up an running over a year later.  Mine has been used a ton of times and I have 5 batteries so it gets some heavy use.  It's also the quadcopter I teach people on so it's had some nasty crashes.<br /><br />These used tiny brushed motors which will easily burn out if the props are stuck against and object and you keep powering the props.  This is simple to avoid, just cut power when you crash or if the quadcopter is stuck.  This simple tip will make the quadcopter last a long time.  After a year of abuse I'm finally replacing parts which was the result of a new pilot crashing and leaving the motors running when the copter was upside down.  It's simple to take apart and fix.  I removed the prop guards to save on weight and props are cheap to replace.<br /><br />I opened the controller and extended the antenna as the built in cheap wire was just dangling inside.  Range improved greatly with this simple mod.<br /><br />The Camera is easy to remove, it's useful for pictures when you want them but it's a pretty weak camera so I usually fly without it.<br /><br />This quadcopter is very lightweight and does not need to be registered with the FAA which is a bonus",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGRJHJ4TLYA6WZOHFKEYX6IW5QOA,1450822182000,3,True

2136,4.0,LOVE this drone but the camera is not anywhere near HD quality!,"[[VIDEOID:bf880873a8165a07ed8622236b8ba2ce]] This little drone is awesome. It is light, portable, and very very easy to fly. I am completely new to drones or anything remote controlled and I can fly this thing easily indoors and outdoors. It can take a LOT of crashes too, especially with the prop guards on. The only problem it has while flying is that if it's windy this drone is so light that it will easily get pushed by the wind, and it also automatically drifts backwards because it is front weighted from the camera. So it can't just hover in the air, you constantly have to push it forward a tiny bit to keep it straight. I never really use it to hover though, so it's not really an issue for me. I got this to practice flying a drone and taking video, and I knew this camera wouldn't be good enough quality for actual photography so I have the x8c as well attached to a 4k action camera, but MAN the camera on this thing sucks. Again, I didn't have high expectations and I only use this for practice, but honestly. It says the camera on the x5c shoots in HD! It does not at all, the video is very grainy and dark. Also, the sounds of the drone flying is so loud that you can't hear anything in the video. I've shot video of my sister yelling into it and it just sounds like mumbling, you cannot distinguish words. Thats the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, other than the crappy camera which is supposed to be &quot;HD&quot; this drone is awesome and I love it.

Light, seemingly sturdy, and coming with all the tools to get it operating, minus 4 AA batteries for the transmitter.<br /><br />The flight was surprisingly smooth, especially for myself and my friend who are both new to drones, and handled very smoothly indoors out of the wind. Took it outside and it did pretty well in some light wind, despite its weight. It did get carried away some times and occasionally blown into trees but I would chalk that up to user experience and wind interference.<br /><br />Got a 6 pack of replacement batteries with a 6 battery charger and would highly recommend you do the same to get some quality time learning the drone without having to stop every 6-7 minutes to charge the single battery it comes with.<br /><br />Have tried the camera, but couldn't remember how to properly operate it and didn't have the instructions at the time, so we ended up just taking still photos.<br /><br />Would give this 3-1/2 stars due to the first not working and the instructions being written in a way that makes hardly any sense (probably some direct language translator that wasn't proof read by anyone that speaks English), but the new drone came quick and works so well that I'm bumping this up to 4 instead of down to 3.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710RcEt3SeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710RcEt3SeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710RcEt3SeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HQwD+Z1NL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HQwD+Z1NL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HQwD+Z1NL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L-TmsUdLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L-TmsUdLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71L-TmsUdLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AG5AHU6JDSM4SQLKGQ2EBSHP22PQ,1533734975008,1,True

My 5th flight attempt was a wash, as one of the motors was dead (see photo). Even though it was 10 days outside of the 30 day warranty, I emailed the company via their &#34;help desk&#34; link, hoping that after explaining that I had only flown it 4 times, they would honor the warranty. No such luck. Haven't heard back from them in over 2 weeks now.

It's my first quadcopter and this thing is a blast to fly.  It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but that's fine with me.  Picture and video quality is okay, but I ordered an 808 camera to replace the one that's on it and will be making my own camera gimbal for stable footage.  The memory card came with test pictures and videos on it from the factory it appears.  I'm not sure if they were taken to test the SD card or if they were taken with the X5C itself.  Picture quality tells me they took it with the drone.<br /><br />This thing is plenty fast enough and is stable.  I've flown nitro RC planes many years ago growing up, so it didn't take me long to get the hang of it.  In low mode it's very friendly and easy to handle, and in high mode it's zippy and responsive.  I was flying through my house and between doorways without any problem.  Even did a few flips inside the house under an 8' ceiling!  It seems to handle wind okay, but you wouldn't want to get it up too high on a gusty day.  Once it's in the air it doesn't wont to come down.  I took it out after dark and flew it with just the lights and it's easy to track.<br /><br />One of the things I was worried about was if you could make slight adjustments while flying, and not just pushing the stick and it flys full speed one direction.  Yes, you can make minor (slow) turns and adjustments for stable flight and videos as long as the wind permits.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about this quad then you should take the leap.  I was debating betweent this and the U818A, but decided to get this one as it looked like it would handle the wind better, and according to the reviews and my experience with the X5C it does.  I ordered 4 extra batteries and ran all 5 of them through it (allowing a cool down period in between) without any issue.

They are def going to crash this a lot and ruin the motors. Its easy enough to take it apart and replace them. Don't bother wasting your time trying to solder new motors on the PCB... just clip the wires and splice them with electric tape. Soldering takes time and isn't really worth it considering they will probably ruin the morons again by crashing this thing while they have the motors running full blast.<br /><br />Personally... this is more like an inside drone to me, or if its outside then just like 6-10 feet high and close to you. Sure... it can fly super super high, that is true. However, it is pretty light and wind ravages this thing out of control. If you let kids fly it outside and high, be prepared to go get it out of a tree or try to find it when it crash lands somewhere hundreds of yards away. I have about 500 acres of open fields behind my house, good for kids flying a kite on a string but not good for kids learning to fly a drone with no GPS or autopilot return, or head forward mode. They shoot this thing straight up, wind catches it then there is no fighting it... its not powerful enough and even full power again wind it will be blown away.<br /><br />Replacing parts is easy.

2316,5.0,Excellent Beginner's Indoor/Outdoor 'Copter,"The X5C delivers stable, easy control and good quality pictures at an amazingly low price. In my experience so far, flight times are longer and charge times shorter than advertised. It is stable enough (and light enough) to be flown safely indoors. Direct sunlight, however, is required for good pictures. The camera is rigidly attached to the airframe, which results in rather shaky video. It records audio as well (mostly, the sound of the motors). It flies very well outdoors, but one has to be careful of wind, as the unit is liable to be blown away, especially if flown too high.<br /> The only complaint I have is that the video switch is a toggle - press once to start recording, press again to stop. A small LED on the camera indicates video recording, but this is impossible to see from the ground in daylight. Thus, one can't quite be sure if one is recording or not. It would be nice to have a &#34;recording&#34; indicator on the control.<br /> In general, the control is well thought out and easy to use. The user's guide is in the usual &#34;Chinglish&#34; and hard to figure out in places.

2322,4.0,Great little r/c quadcopter for a affordable price.,"This quadcopter so far has really been impressive! Ive only flown it 3 times since its arrival but so far it has already passed my expectations I made when I decided to buy a cheap $50 r/c quadcopter. I haven't had a single problem with its performance other than the cheap plastic used for the landing skids and blade protectors. So far they have surprisingly held up even after my first test flight but the skids partially broke at the white pegs that you insert into the copter for me and only due to user error and roughly landing on hard ground from high up. Luckily if you were already thinking about that during your purchase like I did you would have of most likely bought extra blades, blade protectors and skids for it, and the best part is you can get all that and extra motors for under 10 bucks in a package deal! Even with the partially broken skids i can still take off fly and land without further damaging them now that i have the hang of the throttle control. I gave 4 stars due to cheap plastic and the battery cover for being kinda difficult to open without fear of breaking it or the camera attached to it. Other than that it is more than worth its price I think and I recommend it to anyone who has little to no experience with flying r/c copters as the perfect starter/higher experienced r/c pilots. I will do a follow up review when it sees more flight time to say whether its still worth it or not but I don't see it changing my mind since the availability and price of replacement parts",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEULGSWCEGXVSHNL62PXSTKCU7SA,1451854898000,0,True

2353,5.0,Great quad with 500 ft+ range!,"I've owned this quad for about 7 months and flown it for a total of maybe 50 hours or so. Overall, this is a great value and will provide hours of enjoyment. Some people have mentioned how the wind affects it, and in a 15-mph wind you'll likely have great difficulty controlling it. But I've found that moderate wind makes it more fun in some ways. For its weight, there is a LOT of body. The downside of that is how affected it is by the wind. But the upside of that is that if it ends up in a free-fall for any reason (battery dies, pilot error, hit by EMP wave, etc.) it will likely survive the fall if it lands on grass, trees, etc. It is super easy to fly on &#34;normal&#34; mode... give yourself about 4-5 flights to get the hang of it. On &#34;high&#34; mode it reacts much more drastically and will lean so much it may hit the ground if you're not careful.<br /><br />Camera quality: Rather than simply give my opinion, I'd suggest doing a search for &#34;X5C videos&#34; and evaluate the video quality for yourself.<br /><br />Flight duration: On average, about 7 minutes. And that's using the video camera about half the time.<br /><br />Maximum range: A friend of mine and I tested this on his 500-ft long driveway. I was at the end of the driveway and the quad was still getting a signal back at the house. And no, I haven't done any of the range-boosting modifications. Depending on where you live you *might* pick up some interference from other signals. I've taken it straight up at maximum speed on a calm day for 60 seconds before it lost connection. At that height you can barely see this tiny quad so be careful! =)<br /><br />Speed and Rate-of-climb: I would estimate around 20 mph and about 10 ft/sec. (you'll need to be on &#34;high&#34; mode - top left button toggles that function).<br /><br />Durability: I took this quad about 500 feet high and let it free fall - it landed in the grass completely undamaged. One time my friend crashed it into my house at full throttle and that incident bent one of the propeller blades - I bent it back into place and it's been flying fine. Worst accident I had was when the wind caught it and it hit a neighbor's roof, then fell 2 stories down onto the pavement. That time it cracked a motor housing. I put some glue & tape on it and its performance hasn't been affected.<br /><br />Tips: Once you get the hang of it, take off the propeller guards. And definitely buy at least 4 batteries with a 4-battery charger. As an added bonus, get a USB portable charger (around $15 on Amazon) to charge your batteries while you're in the field flying. Who wants to have to walk back inside to charge batteries? Fly safe!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHD6VV74P46A4XDJOGUJCCC4SG7A,1437283212000,3,True

2356,4.0,Great beginner quadcopter,"This is an excellent quadcopter. It's very stable in flight, can move very quickly when you want it to, and has plenty of power. It looks very good, withstands multiple crashes well (I've had quite a few, not broken anything, yet...), and one of the best things is the spare parts are plentiful and cheap! Quite often you may find a quadcopter that seems like a great deal, but finding the spare parts may be exceedingly difficult. As well as quite often the parts quickly become obselete, and stop being manufactured. I've had several RC helicopters which after 6 months to a year, finding spare parts for became impossible.<br />This quadcopter comes with everything you need. Copter, controller, battery, and charger. The flight time is about standard, 7-10 minutes depending on how aggressively you fly it, and whether you have the camera attached or not. Great for beginners to learn how to fly. The remote has 2 settings, a low and high mode. The low makes the copter not move as fast, the controls gentler, perfect for close quarters or slower flying, and for learning to control the copter. High mode makes the copter respond aggressively to controls, for much quicker flight and handling, more suited for outdoors.<br />The only downsides I've found so far have been that the copter has around 50, up to 75 feet of control distance before it loses signal. And the instructions are horribly written in broken English, al,osteoporosis impossible to understand. But you can find plenty of info online from others.<br />I highly recommend buying a spare parts pack, and extra batteries with this, so you're not waiting forever for the battery to charge between flights, or for a new propeller to come in if you break one. Both can be found very cheap, 6 pack of batteries and charger about $20, spare parts pack with everything from 6 sets of blades to extra motors about $20.<br />Overall I highly recommend this copter!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGG4AOWJKMMYYDYRJUR2SPXRKVFQ,1474640088000,1,True

Its fun and easy to fly, takes great pictures and video, its very stable hovering and is very responsive to commands.  I crashed this copter many times in some brutal ways and nothing has broken.  Flight time is very acceptable, but I would suggest 8 or more batteries and a couple extra chargers to keep the action going. Also- the red blades and guards help alot with orientation.

We got over-confident on our first flight and decided to fly it over a tall line of pines. The wind shifted and the drone sat down right onto the top of one of the trees. We were pretty bummed, but decided to wait a few days to see if we could locate it and possibly retrieve it before ordering another. Weeks passed and we had some terribly stormy/rainy nights, and we still had no luck finding it. So, I ordered another and the next morning we decided to go check once more and lo and behold, there is was. The wind had blown it down the previous night apparently. Luckily, my order hadn't shipped yet so I cancelled it. We let it sit for a few hours in case it was wet, re-charged the battery, and went out to try it. To our surpise, it worked perfectly. We have been more careful about flying on windy days, but we are pleased with this drone. The only thing I say is that if you are purchasing mainly for the video capabilities, you probably need to go another route.

I am astonished at how great this thing is.<br /><br />First the bad. It feels incredibly light and cheap. The battery only lasts 7 minutes, and the video resulting from the camera looks like a cell phone from 8 years ago. The instruction manual is written in Engrish. The remote has funny fake buttons to look more complex and futuristic than it is. Remote range seems to be about 200 feet or so, I'm estimating.<br /><br />Now the good. I haven't handled a lot of quadcopters, but this thing handles pretty surprisingly smoothly. Within a day of use, I found I could easily fly this around my back yard, and confidently over water. I am continually shocked by how nimble and precise this thing handles. It really is a joy  to fly, and immediately I had to buy the 6 battery pack so that I wouldn't have to wait.<br /><br />Whatever factors it encounters, the quadcopter does a champion job of staying level. I lost one of the propeller guards after crashing it into a tree, and despite the lopsided weight, it doesn't seem to care. I have flown this thing in moderate winds, over turbulent temperature differences, and it barely fluctuates enough to be able to tell.<br /><br />If you are thinking about getting into flying quadcopters, this is the one to start with, I'm amazed.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGYOEKHA54WLFYVDHEMVYKTFJLWA,1459687766000,9,True

I understood that for less than $50.00 the quality would not be that of a $1,500.00 drone so I was not terribly shocked when one of the green lens covers fell off during a bump on my roof while I was trying to figure out how to fly it. No Problem. I found the lens cover on the roof and just snapped it back into place. Perhaps it was not firmly snapped into place in the beginning. Perhaps it will never fall off again.<br /><br />Everything worked properly as advertised right out of the box (after I charged up the battery). I found it VERY DIFFICULT to get the controller adjusted so that the drone would stay in place with all controls centered. In fact, I don't think I ever got the controller to adjust correctly for stationary hovering.<br /><br />Much more could be said about learning to fly this unit AS A FIRST-TIME PILOT, but suffice it to say that for the price vs. product I personally feel that this is a VERY GOOD FIRST DRONE. I also purchased a pack of four extra batteries with charger so Ethan won't be limited to 5-7 minutes of fun between charges.

As far as the X5C, it is a great quadcopter as far as handling, control, performance, etc.  The one thing I do not like about the X5C is that when the battery gets low the lights blink for about TWO SECONDS and then the unit shuts off!  If it's 50 ft. up in the air when this happens, it comes down right then!  I have the X5SW and the X8C Venture and they do not do this.  Both of these blink their lights to indicate low battery and then give more than ample time to bring them back in before they shut off.  I think this quick shut-off is a real problem with this unit.  Now I take a little digital timer with me and set it for a reasonable flight time, then bring the unit back in close to me for the rest of the flight because I know it's going to drop almost as soon as the lights start blinking.  I would advise spending the bit of extra money and getting the X5SW which does not have this quick shut-off problem.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFUCKMI6Z4PCXPCYJYTBK554SLKA,1461254698000,4,True

The controller appears to have buttons that have purpose but are just actually no more than decoration. The SD sim card on the drone for recording holds up to 8 gb which is fair, but it's complicated at first to understand how to actually record and take video with having a steady hand to do so without it taking off into space, losing control and it flying away into in my case a wild hillside.  Trying to find where it crashed to me was almost worth it because I was having fun... it being something affordable and different to master. Then I came to the conclusion that it's not worth my life with rattlesnakes, and mountain lions to say the least roaming behind my hillside.  Disappointing in truth of the battery lasting around a good 5 minutes with at least a 1.5 hour recharge. I credit the barrel roll that it can do, but my advise is do not fly it too high up, especially with a little wind because you will definitely lose it quickly.  Fun for beginners, but easy to lose.  I credit its durability surviving the few crashes I had to enjoy it with. If your willing to spend fifty bucks, I suggest you play a little more for one with GPS.

Both pictures are not consistent with logo and unit/camera/battery orientation.<br /><br />Trial and error made most things clear. The manual was only needed to explain camera operation. (And flip and mode control - never used - unwanted.) Suggestion: Change camera control switch so it doesn't look like a trim tab. And stamp indicators on it to show what it does. A red video &#34;recording&#34; light would be a good spiff, too. Unfortunately, my camera was DOA.<br /><br />Learning to fly: It was fun to fly. Learning curve was fast. The unit is built from light, springy plastic. Great for crashing! Also, the built-in, motor-kill-on-crash feature is a godsend. I crashed it every flight, indoors, but was getting the hang of it when, on the 3rd battery charge, a crash left a tiny gear lost forever. Looks like a replacement takes a month to get here. But, given the dead camera, maybe it's best to reject the whole unit and try again.<br /><br />Do not know about transmitter range. But if it's the reported 100 feet, then suggest that be extended on the next product rev. 100 feet doesn't get above the trees in Seattle area.<br /><br />Not absolutely sure the trim tabs work at all. A bit subtle, they are.<br /><br />Flight control thought/suggestion: To compensate for the drop in lift, it might be interesting to auto-adjust the power when navigating.<br /><br />Bottom line: Fun few moments, but not worth 50 bucks 'cause of the lost gear after just a few minutes of flying. We'll see what happens when the parts come in. Or, heck. maybe it's best to reject the unit on camera grounds and try again.<br /><br />Advice to others with no drone experience: Yes, the experienced guys are right about getting a cheap &#34;toy&#34; like this to learn to fly. First flying is crash city. And, get a gob of batteries. If you figure to play for an hour, you'll want a dozen. Which means you'll need a lot of USB charging ports and cables to juice them.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Sent the unit with the bad camera back. Could not figure out how to just return the camera, nor a way to make good that I had lost the little gear.<br /><br />Ordered another unit.<br /><br />It came quickly. And, the next day an already-ordered pack of 4 batteries come in.<br /><br />The new quad's camera works. Movies are reasonably clear for a cheap camera. The only way to see if it's taking movies is an obscure red light inside the camera housing. If you let the battery die without stopping video recording, you may get no movie. Figure around 2 megabytes per second, so the 4G card is good for over a half hour.<br /><br />Could not find the limits to the controller's range. The quad went out of sight down the driveway while still under control. 100, 150 feet away, at the least. Beyond earshot.<br /><br />Lost a motor. It went bad in stages. Ran thru all 5 batteries before the motor was no longer operable. Now to wait a month for a pack of motors.<br /><br />No change to the review bottom line because of the bad motor. It appears this device really needs a lot of spare parts on hand. That parts are replaceable is remarkable, though, for a throw-away type toy. That they take so long to get is the unit's biggest downside.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEFGRTMGPI55OD54ZHBBY2QN25CQ,1435408630000,1,True

2432,5.0,A pleasure to fly,I bought 4 additional battery pack and was able to learn how to fly quickly. There are two different flying modes which I found helpful. Mode 1 is Up/Down/Move Left/Move Right on the right stick. Mode 2 is UP/DOWN/TURN LEFT/TURN RIGHT on the left stick. Coming from flying exclusively airplanes I found Mode 2 a good way to break in to flying a quad. Once I was more confident I was able to switch to Mode 1 and now I am able to fly where I want to after about 2 hours of flight time. Handles a moderate breeze well and can deal with a lot of crash landings on grass without damage.<br />The camera footage is not great but what do you expect for a $40 aircraft. I was able to inspect the shingles on my roof by flying over and the camera is in focus with good color and decent resolution. HOWEVER 700mb for a 6 minute video is a bit excessive.

2462,5.0,Excellent for the price!,"I got my son one of these for Christmas and ended up with one myself. I've been practicing with mine and have gotten better at flying it (it does take practice). My son hasn't flown his nearly as much and yesterday saw me flying mine up high and he decided to try and see how high he could fly his.<br /><br />Before I could stop him it drifted into the tallest nearby tree-about 40 feet up. The only thing I could get that high was to try and knock it out with a pellet gun. Several unsuccessful shots through the body later we tag teamed and he hit the throttle and I shot- our first try together we got it falling out of the tree, hitting lots of branches on its way down.<br /><br />All of that to say this-despite the holes shot through it and despite falling out of the tree and crashing down this copter still flies. I have crashed mine in some pretty ridiculous ways, too, and it just keeps on flying. It is good to note that the controllers sync to a copter so you can fly multiple copters at one in the same area.<br /><br />A more technical evaluation: The copter is light, and flying it outdoors is a challenge even with minimal wind. The stabilization is pretty good but it doesn't auto hover or anything fancy so don't expect it to fly itself. That's also a good thing in a way-you are more in control, kind of like driving a manual instead of an automatic.<br /><br />The flight time was what I saw in other reviews at about 7-8 minutes. I very soon after bought a set of 700mAh batteries that are more responsive and fly longer. In my case I bought a five pack with a five port charger so I can usually fly as long as my free time to fly lasts (or longer and I have to go without getting to use all the batteries).<br /><br />Today I finally tried out the 360 roll feature and it worked very well. It loses a lot of altitude so you need to make sure you are high enough to execute it or maybe I need to just be harder on the throttle (it could certainly be user error).<br /><br />There is a huge difference between the two performance modes and now that I'm somewhat more comfortable with flying it I really enjoy the faster controls.<br /><br />The photos and videos aren't fantastic but are acceptable. I had no idea the video had sound, too, but it's kind of pointless because it how much prop noise the mic picks up.<br /><br />Only cons (at this price point) would be the difficulty to fly outdoors and that it can need some fiddling with the on center adjustments to keep it flying true so that it responds to controls predictably.<br /><br />I have also ordered some three blade props to see if they make it even more responsive and handle even better.<br /><br />For the price it seems like it would be hard to find anything better-it is an accurate, EXTREMELY durable quad copter that is fun, agile and with it's two power profiles it is good for beginners and to grow with. It certainly isn't anything super fancy needing virtual reality goggles to pilot or anything but for what it is I am very, very pleased.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGKJ22QTLRV6KLOXKEWOAHIXOYRA,1454214328000,1,True

I'd recommend to anyone curious about quads but looking for a little better experience than what you get out of the toy aisle.  As noted by various reviews this is a really light quad for it's size so while it works well outdoors, it does get pushed around quite a bit in the wind.  Anything other than a light breeze wouldn't really be recommended.  I did crash a couple of times but mostly because of my own inexperience.  The included extra props come in very handy but if you're learning I'd suggest getting more to have on hand.  Extra batteries will also add to flight time and overall enjoyment.

If I had 2 more hands I'd video the issue.  These fly really nice if you can get one that isn't defective out of the box. Or missing parts.

2528,5.0,I will buy more as these wear out. - Outstanding!,"This has to be one of the best toys I have ever had. I am over 60 so I have had lots of toys.<br />I bought two of the Syma X5Cs.  No problems with hundreds of flights on them.  They fly very smooth and fast.  I would estimate about 150 to 200 feet straight up.  The reason I have two is so that I can alternate between them so the motors can cool off between flights.  With 9 batteries it is easy to fly for over an hour at a time.<br />These were my first quad copters, so they have many wrecks and so far no real damage.  I burned up one motor, that was my fault for leaving the throtle stick on when it was upside down after a crash.<br />If you remove the prop guards, camera and battery cover and fly in expert mode you can easily fly in 8-10 mph winds,  I have flown in higher winds but they are too light for that..<br />I would  recommend taking it apart (about 26 tiny screws) and moving the battery connector to the under side (route the wires through the battery compartment).  You will be able to make a much better connection to the battery. I have connected my batteries hundreds of times with no problem.  Before the mod, my batteries wouldn't always make a good connection..<br />The camera is not great, but what do you expect for less than $60, it works if you have an understanding of computers and the importance of closing files.<br />Buy the $6 spare parts kit with 4 motors and you will get ton's of flights on these.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGPBK2PEFF4YQOZ2WQQYUU6DSWPQ,1455859379000,2,True

On one of the videos I watched someone use heat-shrink on a solder joint with a heat gun. I did this and fried my controller and had to order another one.  If you do it, shrink it with a soldering iron.  Once I got my new generic controller the video doesn't work.<br /><br />I still love this quad because it does very well in the wind.  I have seen other reviews that it does not, but that was probably when the controller was set on low speed. On high it will cut right through the wind. On low it just kind of hovers in one place.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone buying this to buy some extra skids and other accessories such as batteries.

One of the green plastic covers over LED light did disappear during my full flight today.<br />- The little camera had a 8 gig micro SD card with it, also came with the thingy you can put that in so your computer can read it.<br />- I think it will take a good while to learn how to fly it<br />- Do not let your young kiddos try it, unless you have looooooooooots of room.

At one point one of the props was binding once a revolution but it turned out that a small piece of sand got stuck between the cogs of the prop gear.  I simply popped the grain of sand out and problem solved.  Be prepared to buy more batteries.  This thing is such a blast that every time I go flying now I use at least four batteries (I get about 7 minutes of aggressive flight per battery).  If you are just learning make sure there is no wind.  At this point I'm able to fly in 5-8 mph wind but it takes everything this quad has to fly against the wind.

2692,5.0,Great Drone for the Money!,"We bought one for our college age son and one for our 16 year old daughter for Christmas. They are a huge hit! They've been practicing flying them in the house, and once outside when there wasn't much wind. The battery life is just as described - roughly 15 minutes or so. We did go ahead and buy the extra batteries as suggested by other reviewers, which has worked out perfectly. I was worried that the propellers would break, but these have landed against chair legs, kitchen cabinets, etc and they've held up well. The drones are really light weight. One hit against a light fixture that hangs by a chain over our dining table. The light never moved, the drone bounced off like it hit a wall. These are great introductory drones, they aren't fancy and you certainly can't be stealthy - they're pretty loud. But for the money, these are super fun and a true surprise on Christmas morning. (It's hard to surprise kids their ages. If you're a parent of a teen, you know what I'm saying.) I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a cool gift for a teen or teen at heart - my mom just ordered one as a surprise for my dad's 70th birthday!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AG4HPGKMA7GXOEIFBDHFYUCIPF3A,1483119677000,0,True

2705,5.0,"Fun, sturdy, and economical.","Let me start by saying this is the first quadricopter I have owned. I purchased this on a whim when it was a few dollars off on holiday lightning deals. I could really not be happier with my purchase. Here are the main points, as I see them, in favor of this device.<br /><br />Affordable - Knowing somewhat about the costs of the 'pro level' drones, I wasn't expecting much for $40-$50. However, this thing goes really high,<br />and zooms around quite quickly. The video quality- while nothing shocking- is better than I expected it to be.It is pretty interesting to get those sweeping (though perhaps a bit shakier) flying shots you are used to seeing in movies.  I do question the inclusion of the microphone, since you can hear nothing over the buzzing of the rotors. The battery lifetime is right in line with what is promised (~7 minutes). I purchased another set of rotors, and some (off brand) batteries, and I still haven't spent $100.<br /><br />Durable -  Another thing I was worried about was durability. I hear stories of people buying these things and crashing them into trees or a wall and that being the end of them. However, I have given this thing some pretty rough landings. One time I cut the throttle as it got out of sight over my house. It landed on the roof, skidded off, over the fence and landed upside down; I did not notice that this affected it. I also land it in high grass which has tangled up the rotors, but not damaged them. I have seen small bits of debris (mostly bits of grass) in the plastic gears at the base of the rotors, and this does not seem to affect it.<br /><br />FUN!!! - This thing is fun! I bought this to see if I might be interested in moving up to something by DJI, but for the moment I having plenty of fun with this one. Even on fairly windy days, you can take this out and have fun zipping around.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AG3RUAIJBDMYHRVHTXBEGCUNHO7Q,1453927782000,0,True

2713,4.0,A lot of drone here for very little $$$.,"This is one little rugged copter and it has impressed me enough to buy 3 more for gifts. Let me give the breakdown:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)  It's a great drone to learn with. It flies fairly accurate and it is stable.<br />2)  Quality is pretty good for the low cost of this unit. It is a tough little piece of equipment and has survived several assassinations attempts from<br />  the trees.<br />3)  Camera quality is good. Not HD great, just good but for the price it does a spectacular job.<br />4)  It'll go a LONG ways in the air. This thing gets some altitude to the extent of almost losing it multiple times. Thank goodness it has a<br />  phenomenal range or we would have lost it. Something to be mindful of.<br />5)  Included SD card holds all of your flight videos. It makes for some REALLY COOL videos when you do gentle 360 degree sweeping views.<br />6)  Battery life is great and charging is very quick (we have 4 batteries so there is minimal downtime).<br />Cons:<br />1)  It can be difficult to control or know what direction you have to go when you hit higher altitudes. There is different colored LED lights on the underbelly to help you navigate with direction but that doesn't help when you're colorblind. I personally colored one side bright yellow so as to help me identify directional steering. Although at tall heights...all this disappears from view anyway.<br />2)  The motors are very noisy and will overpower any sounds in your videos.<br /><br />For the money, this is a FANTASTIC piece of equipment to enjoy! Parts are available cheaply and it is a terrific way to learn to fly before jumping to a more expensive unit. All in all, we are very impressed with this &#34;toy&#34;.

Bummer Is That It Failed After A Handful Of flights.","I have had a number of small drones over the years and they vary from fun/easy to use and annoying/tough to fly.  This quad was a very fun and easy to fly device.  It is also very easy to capture still images and video using the included camera.  The image/Video quality was very solid and it even includes sound when recording video - though you will mostly hear the whir of the props.  While not jet speed, it is a fairly fast quad and it can go about 3-4 stories up and/or about 100-150 feet away before losing signal.  All in all this is a fun quad/drone that folks of moderate flying skill should be able to use<br /><br />I am only giving three stars because the setup only lasted about six uses before one of the motors just quit working.

Wish it came with a better antenna and bigger batteries.,"Pros:<br />Maneuverable & quick response time<br />Can hover over same spot in wind speeds up to 10mph+<br />Very light<br />Durable - I crash it all the time, even free falling from max altitude and landing on roof.<br />Blades slow descent when looses power and falls inverted - like a fast parachute.<br />Uprights itself after free fall (usually facing original direction).<br />LED lights allow for flying at night :-)<br />Can be flown indoors when you get good at it<br />Can fly as high as antenna allows (even with mods)<br /><br />Cons:<br />The built-in antenna, particularly on the transmitter, really restricts the range (100ft-ish).  With a minor WIFI antenna mod, range = visual limits!<br />LEDs usually flash when TX signal lost and defaults to neutral controls with a slow descent, however, often the copter just &#34;freezes&#34; on last command until regains signal.<br />There is little to no warning when the battery is low.  Usually, the LEDs start to flash giving you have 5-10 seconds before it drops out of the sky.  But, sometimes your warning is a free fall - especially with the small battery it comes with.<br />My 3 year old can write better instructions.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Replace the transmitter antenna with an old WIFI router antenna (or find a cheap 2.4gHz antenna online).  Range will increase from ~100ft to visual limits (~400ft).  I first replaced it with a 6.2cm solid copper wire from a Coax cable - range doubled, but a commercial antenna worked a little better.  I also replaced the RX antenna (~1.5inch, insulated, stranded wire) with a 6.2cm solid, insulated wire.  I didn't notice an improvement, but am confident that it is more reliable.<br />Buy bigger batteries to increase flight time. I currently have 800mAh.  Flight time is 9 minutes when not recording or using the 3D eversion, and with guards taken off.<br />Paint the bottom bright red & green (or at least the red half) so you can determine the orientation at further distances and not lose control!<br />Hold the 3D eversion button (top/right) while moving the right stick (rudder) left or right.  You CAN record while performing aerobatics.<br />Although it can fight decent winds, it is very light weight and susceptible to gusts and stronger winds.  It is most fun to fly in 0 wind and lower wind speed = higher altitude possible.<br />Don't forget to hit the record button to stop recording and write the video file to the card BEFORE turning power OFF to the quad.<br />Write your address somewhere visible on the quad so you get it back (hopefully) after it flies into your neighbors yard.<br />Keep the copter out of the cone of confusion (don't point the end or bottom tip of the TX antenna at the copter).  For best reception, hold the TX antenna parallel to the RX antenna.  The stock RX antenna sits limp in a forward-ish facing direction (open up the copter to see exactly how it sits).<br />You don't need the blade guards.  They help if you run into things a lot, but once you get the hang of it they are just drag & weight.  The motors stop spinning when you hit something and I also cut the power when about to crash.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEBBMEC5MALXXGTTLZRM5L4JCRPQ,1436223056000,0,True

Drone battery required charging which was quickly set up using the enclosed USB cable and an available slot at my charging station.<br /><br />Flying this really requires some effort, especially if you wish to hover, the motors aren't very synchronized and each fan section produces a slightly different amount of lift so the platform constantly drifts.  the trim adjustments on the motor heads aren't sufficient to offset the lift production differences so the platform is always turning making it difficult to orient and steer.  The real challenge with this &#34;toy&#34; is being able to keep it in the air and not crashing into anything.  the power and steering controls are sloppy based on the lag time.

Wind can effect it's flight of course but in expert mode you have the power to bring it back if it starts getting carried away. It's really simple to control and will get as aggressive as you care to fly it.<br /><br />I used a lot of the info from quadcopter 101 youtube vids and his blog to learn the basics. After buying more batteries which I highly recommend, it took me about 2 hours flight time to go from hovering and simple box patterns to full on banked turns.<br /><br />I had hoped the camera was better but for the money it's not that bad. I swapped out the screws that hold it in place with longer screws from the unused blade protectors. Only screwing them in a few turns I can drop the angle of the camera so it doesn't just shoot straight at the ground. It's now shoots more forward which to me is great. What isn't great about it is the jello effect in bright light. It's pretty bad and makes for some unusable footage. I've seen vids using the 808 key chain camera attached to the X5C that look decent so I guess I could spend twenty more bucks and get better footage but really I'll just wait until I'm a better pilot and get a quad that is setup for areal footage at some point.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AG6DJRBL3HQ2P73VPMDL7FE5LSRA,1442281657000,0,True

3031,5.0,This drone is great and he has thanked us repeatedly for it,"We bought this for our 10-year-old son, even though it was rated ages 14 and up, as a Christmas present. This drone is great and he has thanked us repeatedly for it! Considering that there is a learning curve for anyone using a remote control for the first time, this drone is very durable and forgiving. Our son mostly flew it out in our field, so it had soft ground to land on. However, there were many times he and our other older kids flew it inside and it took its share of wacks on the wall, ceiling and, floor. We bought a micro SD card for it - other reviewers said it came with theirs, but ours did not - and he can take pictures or record video with it. When he's done recording he just puts the SD card into the adapter, pops it into the laptop, and watches his flight. It is so easy!<br />The battery life is 5-7 minutes of flight, which has not been a problem. We did end up buying a second battery to have at the ready while the other one charges.<br />We wanted to start out with a less expensive model drone while our son got the hang of it, and in case it got broken, so we got this.

3059,5.0,This product is just silly fun!,"This product is just silly fun.  Only flown it twice so far.  There is a learning curve.  The first flight boys and I struggled mightily.  We could manage to take off and hover a bit, but any additional flight input usually involved killing power and bringing to ground quickly as we lost &#34;feel&#34; for direction/input.  The learning curve is quick though.  Our second flight I was able to figure out orientation (from the LED lights) of the heading and really started to have some fun.  Still pretty quick to lose &#34;feel&#34; of direction/input especially as we approach trees etc. and kill power a lot to avoid an &#34;incident.&#34;  We love this.  Its cheap and FUN!  Haven't used the camera yet as we need a memory card.  Our best recommendation is to use the blade guards.  They have saved the quadcopter from damage multiple times (they flex).  Also learn to fly this in a LARGE open grassy area.<br /><br />[UPDATE] I've flown this at least ten times now.  We love this quadcopter.  Still disappointed it didn't come with the microSD card (it comes with the USB adapter for one) and we still haven't bought one, though we plan to.  This is very very easy to fly at night due to the LEDs making it very clear the orientation and heading.  Since we started flying it in our wide open grassy park we've had a blast.  Not a good idea to learn to fly this in a neighborhood with streets and houses.  It would be too easy to lose.  Twice we've gotten lucky finding it in someone's yard.  Stick to BIG wide open parks and be aware that ANY wind will carry the quadcopter at altitude faster than it can fight.  High altitude is fun, but it will lose its signal.  If its windy and high, it can be gone in a hurry! We found that out.  Luckily we found it.  It survived a 300ft fall with not even a scratch.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFCL7PRSI3JWNJX5JYJR6EBNIWOQ,1528746332235,0,True

It is fun to get to the point where you can fly it where you want it to go without banking hard back and forth.<br /><br />The camera works well. It takes pictures and video. As someone else said, don't forget to end your video while everything is still on and working or else it doesn't  save.<br /><br />The range is pretty good until you really try to get it out there and then you find it's limits.<br />I'd say mine is about 80 yards out and 100 feet up. So less than 150 yards Tops! You find out instantly when it's out of range. Basically you lose all control for a moment or permanently.<br />It's scary. I had it fall out of the air 100 ft to grass (no damage). Modification exists to boost range. I will investigate and add my experience.<br /><br />And the fall from the air leads to another point.<br />This running is fricking tough! Tough I say! Tough!<br />I have crashed it unbelievably hard and it's still going like new. Into walls, into tile floors into cement, into gravel upside down full throttle.<br /><br />All those were accidental and not without sadness but it took it like superman and shrugged it off to fly again.<br /><br />I read all the reviews about it's build strength and hoped for the best but I am absolutely floored by it's reliance. Very very resilient machine.<br /><br />I got extra blades in the box.

3089,5.0,Good first RC quad.  Easy to learn on.,"(One month in)  Everything is working great, I've had one of the LED light boards go out (it's very dim.)  Spare parts were about $5 on Amazon.  I've replaced propellers after bending a few on a wild ride.<br /><br />I had a couple flyaways in beginner mode early on.  (Mode switch is edge button on upper left corner, one beep is beginner, two is advanced.)  In advanced mode you can overcome a lot more wind, manuever and fly significantly quicker.  If it's a windy flyaway, switch o advanced mode.  If it's an orientation problem (you've lost track of which direction the front of the copter is facing) and the copter is flying away, switch to beginner mode so you aren't unintentionally flying away at top speed.<br /><br />Working on a way to mount camera so it is horizontal instead of tilted downward a couple degrees.  I alwats seem to miss what I'm trying to film (sunsets) as the camera is always pointed below the horizon...  Also contemplating a way to mount the camera facing the ground (vertical) as I like the resulting effect.<br /><br />(Original review)<br />Great starter quad, taken several tumbles, unplanned landings, with nothing broken yet.  Camera is good, not excellent, but for $40-50 more than good value-for-money.<br /><br />Buy extra batteries (Tenergy 3.7V 700mAh are a good choice for extra flying time, same size as stock.)<br />[[ASIN:B00ZSO56KM Tenergy 5 pcs of 3.7V 700mAh LiPO Battery (Compatible with Syma X5, X5C, X5SC, X5SW and Cheerson CX-30W)]]<br />Get a real LiPO charger (even a cheap Chinese-made one) instead of using the USB charging cable.<br />Get a LiPO battery guard sleeve to store and charge your batteries in.<br />A full replacement set of (spare/crash) parts is cheap insurance as well.<br /><br />Tip: As well as the time.txt trick (google or read top Amazon review), make a file on the microSD card that contains your contact information to help get your copter back home if you lose it.<br /><br />Late November 2015 delivered product came with 4GB microSD card instead of 2GB card in product description.

It is not operator-centric, meaning you have to keep track of which is the front of the drone which is difficult at distance.

Although it is a great beginner drone, and definitely worth the money, it does take a lot of practice if you've never before flown one!  I took one reviewer's suggestion NOT to put on the blade guards, and am happy about that, because I have put it into some trees, and often it does find its own way to the ground; I can see how having the blade guards will cause it to hang up more.  First-timers will definitely have to practice at lower altitudes - hovering, back and forth/side-to-side, squares, circles, etc. before taking this to heights.  It's very durable; I've panicked and crashed this to the ground from altitude (50+ feet) several times, and it just takes it in stride.  Now that I have this, I do kind of miss the features that some of the more expensive drones have, like altitude hold and auto-return.  That just means I'll need a bit more practice.  The up-side is that for a drone of this price, the pictures and videos are exceptional!  Definitely buy the spare batteries and propeller blades - they are very inexpensive and nice to have.

3265,5.0,Excellent Drone for Pros and Noobs alike!,I purchased this Drone in August of this year and its still going great in October after many hours of indoor and outdoor flights. Its a great Drone to learn to fly on and a good inexpensive Drone to purchase to determine if you are into the hobby before spending more money on a non toy grade unit. Flight time with the stock battery is 5 - 7 min depending on the conditions and if you are using the camera. The Camera quality is OK but good enough to review the flights later and make out the details of your surroundings. Purchase a set of extra batteries and boot your run time to a total of an hour (with battery swaps) for a ton of fun. Range using the stock remote is 75 - 100 meters which is plenty for this unit and the remote can be modified to extend the range even more if you are so inclined.<br />This is a great drone and a great value.,[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHP5HE3KZ6VTH2S3QRK5MIZTIJAA,1476726897000,1,True

I just wanted something inexpensive to learn on and get started.  I gave it 5 stars because for what it is, it's near perfect. Very stable and on high rates can handle quite a bit of wind. I was out flying in my front yard yesterday and it was blowing about 5 to 10 mph. In low rates I had trouble penetrating, but once in high rate mode it just tore through the wind gusts.  I've already removed the prop guards and changed the camera angle.  Planning on doing the range mod next as soon as I get the parts.  I have flown it out of range a couple times but was able to recover once it fell back into range.  This little thing is so light that I had it fall about 70 feet to the ground (grass) today.  Not a scratch. Unless you hit cement edge first from high altitude this thing seems pretty bullet proof.  The video better than I expected.  It's not super high resolution but it still looks great at 720P.  It suffers in low light but that's to be expected.  There are some really good videos on YouTube on how to upgrade the battery, transmitter antenna, receiver antenna, and even make it FPV capable.  I look forward to many hours of fun with this little starter quad.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEJJZPEROU4S6LKOH5LR2Z5RQEEQ,1449530329000,3,True

Well, guess what AMAZON, this gift will not make it on time for xmas.<br /><br />I just got this product just 2 days ago and like what others said about it.. IT'S A GREAT STARTER DRONE FOR ANYBODY. If you an enthusiast like me, I would highly recommend this as your starter drone. FLY, CRASH, REPAIR then FLY again! Till it cant fly anymore!<br /><br />PROs:<br />1) PRICE - The price was perfect! At the time I purchased this, it was $38.99. Spare parts are also cheap (which I highly recommend buying)!<br />2) Ease Of Use - Great for beginners! Easy to control.<br />3) Looks Great - It's not too small yet it's not really that big. Kids will sure love this as a gift. For enthusiast like me, you might say it's OK for the size.<br /><br />CONs:<br />1) Battery Life - Horrible! I know it was already stated so many time how long the flight time would be, BUT it sure feels way TOO SHORT. They should've included an extra battery. To fix this you would need to purchase extra batteries. I would recommend something like the [[ASIN:B00XHLE5V4 BTG 3.7V 680mAh Battery 6PCS & 6 In 1 Battery Charger for Syma X5C X5SW X5C-1 X5SC X5SC-1]]. DO NOT BUY BATTERIES THINKING THEY WOULD FIT!!! PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK TO SEE IF IT WILL FIT IN YOUR X5c.<br />2) CAMERA IS NOT THAT GOOD - I marked this as a CON because the did declare that has an HD Cam but the resolution is HORRIBLE! So if you are buying this because your thinking of doing great home areal movie shots, you might want to re-think that thought.<br /><br />NOW WHY IS IT JUST 2 STARS?? -<br />As soon as I got this product, I was soo excited. I charged the battery and read the manual. As soon as the batteries were done charging, I did all the things the manual said... PLUS I also did a few extras like check the blades and make sure it wasn't broken, make sure the polarity on my batteries are right and so on...No WIND! NICE! Turned on the remote, turn on the copter, paired the two... tested the throttle... All great! She flew UP then she went down! After this happend 5 times and broke one of the blade protectors (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CONNECTING THEM), I noticed that the copter seems to be dropping it pair with the remote.

Other reviewers noted this, but I was still surprised to experience it for myself. I can't think of another device that runs out of juice after less than ten minutes, then takes more than an hour to recharge. I get it, though - a bigger battery would be too big.

This thing is SOLID!  It's motors are power compared to what you expect, and the camera is much better than the SYMA X5SW FPV model (&#60;----------this model is NOT worth it).  This camera is super decent compared to its price.  This quadcopter's controls are super responsive.  Just be watchful of your distance of your X5C from you and your controller, because you will lose control if you do.  I got mine stuck about 40 feet up in  a tree in my front yard, but was able to get it down by throwing a football at it!  It feel flat on the ground and was effected by none of it.

As this is not an FPV drone, it is more challenging right off the bat, which is good as my next quadracopter will feature FPV, and cost significantly more, I want to make sure I have no doubts safely flying it back home should the FPV / GPS / Return Home functions fail for whatever reason as a redundancy safety measure.

I would have given the x5c a five star but a motor went out after about ten flights.<br />I replaced the motors with  (Mudder 4 Piece Anti-clockwise and Clockwise Motor with Brass Gear for Syma X5 X5C: replaced all four).  Now I have a super quad.  I have flown in 8mph winds and the little quad meets the challenge.  I loved it so much I decided to purchase a second.  So I decided on the x5sc because it has a headless mode.  BIG MISTAKE... The x5sc is extremely difficult to control and will not fly in any wind.  The x5cs tries to level out when flying up wind letting the wind carry it off uncontrollably. My recommendations for the Syma x5 line of quads is...Not all are created equally...these products are probably best suited for flying outdoors in very open spaces.  The included camera is adequate, it requires a lot of light for the best video and always remember to turn of the camera from the remote before turning off power at the quad.  If you don't the files become corrupt and sometimes cannot be recovered.  I will probably buy another x5c just for a spare.

I got it stuck in a tree it snowed overnight and when I got it out it worked perfect. If that wasn’t enough to keep my flying safe I of course tested my luck . I then got it stuck in a tree wildcard weekend about month ago at a local park.... I tried with a few things to get it down ; football , baseball , grappling hook... and was unsuccessful for a few weeks. That being said we live in NJ we had at least three snowstorms and a few serious rain storms. On the morning of the Super Bowl  I embarrassingly climbed this tree and was able to shake the branch to free it. After all this the drone works perfectly fine! 2 reccomendations I would make. First buy extra batteries because it is not a large drone you only get about 10 minutes fly time. Second do not install the blade guards ... my drone only got stuck because of the blade guards . Also, they are only good to keep the blade from hitting people indoors they are not really a protection measure for the blades.

At about 30 feet it dropped connection, continued going higher and away until, what I presume, it cut power and stuck itself with branches stuck up around 50 feet in a tree. Unrecoverable due to its positioning, it was gone after just a few uses.<br /><br />I want to give it a higher rating and attribute it to me just having bad luck, but because of its unexpectedly short range (only ~10 meters is far below expected) causing me to be out $40, I can't help but take it down to 2 stars as I assume I got a defective antennae like others have mentioned.

Camera is pretty awful, but who cares when you're having this much fun. Still useful for taking pics and &#34;dronies,&#34; even short videos of your neighborhood at heights you'd never achieve without a remote device...<br /><br />I've had RC toys for decades and this one delivers the best experience especially for the cost (even at full price). Buy extra batteries as they last less than 10 minutes each. PRACTICE in a big open area like a park or baseball field. Stay away from trees as branches love this thing. Also, the wind can easily wreak havoc on it, especially at high altitudes. When the lights blink and it's really far away it means the signal is lost which you should run to it as the wind can take it higher and farther from you. This happened to me TWICE as I went super high on my street and it blew it a block over. Landed on concrete and was fine both times (after calibrating it). Discovered my local parks and that's a better area to learn. Patience is the key. Learn restraint and control and this quad-copter will pay you back in fun! (Seriously, I've dreamt about flying it...)<br /><br />Check out YOUTUBE for helpful tips and tricks. I plan on upgrading soon, but I love this thing.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AESKOPWYNTENQG2KUVN3T6QCBECQ,1453314112000,0,True

It's easy to fly inside and out and my 6 year old can maneuver it like a pro. It takes a beating real well and still works time after time. The landing pad snapped with a fall and some electric tape held it together just fine. I would recommend buying more batteries and a multiple outlet battery charger....it's so fun that you don't want to limit your time just because of the battery running out of juice! It's super easy to change the battery. We're still learning how to take pics and video and have gotten a few decent ones so far. We did lose the SD card with a crash, I guess it must have fallen out so I'd recommend gently taping it in there securely if you're going to use that option.

He was so happy when he opened it. Naturally, we all took turns trying to get it off the ground and it was pretty easy to get a hang of. The first battery died after about 7 minutes, which we expected. So we switched the battery and after about 1 minute it just stopped working. We tried for awhile but could not get it to work. After further investigation, we found that a lot of people said the motors were melting. You can imagine my sons disappointment that is beloved new drone was broken after only 10 minutes. We had to go through the hassle of returning and will have to buy a new one now. I tried contacting the company directly but it is based out of China and has no US numbers. No surprise there.

3631,4.0,Grotty camera quality but a fantastic drone to learn on.,"[[VIDEOID:a60434ebab5637b88b2c846068399eef]] (Please note that the video that I've uploaded along with this review has been through the youtube stabilisation filter _and_ I also &#34;chopped out&#34; most of the &#34;I'm looking at the ground while I move position or get tilted to keep position&#34; bits.)<br /><br />I'm very sceptical on the quality of cheap products and this was one of the ones I was worried about. I only ordered it to use up gift vouchers.<br />After many months of ownership I've finally decided to write this review. If you are interested in the camera - see near the end of this review.<br />I'm impressed with the drone and just how robust it is. I've crashed it many times, flung it at the ground by mistake on full throttle and hit walls.<br />A few weeks ago I removed the &#34;blade guards&#34;, stand and camera to reduce the weight of the drone and potentially improve flight time.<br /><br />I've crashed it even more since - now have a bent blade and rotating blade mount pillar.<br />Though all of that the drone _still_ continues to fly and still gives the specified flight time.<br /><br />The most recent flight I timed at 8 minutes and 30 seconds outdoors mainly heavy use with a bit of playing about, landing it etc..<br /><br />Given how difficult the drone was to control when I first got it (due to my inexperience) I would STRONGLY suggest buying this to learn on and have fun with. If you crash and break it - who cares, it didn't really cost much.<br />The first few flights: First I lost the drone in a field and had to find it. Then I lost the drone over a building and, luckily, could get access and regain it from their sports pitch.<br />Even more recently with my experience and pretty good control of the drone I've managed to fly it too high several times and get it taken by the wind and been very, very close to losing it. I've only managed to recover it mainly by luck and a lot of running towards it so it didn't lose reception.<br /><br />Camera:<br />The camera may as well not exist. I've taken it off and don't really intend to reattach it unless a friend would like a bad resolution video of their house from above.<br />The main problem is the drone isn't stable enough to produce an enjoyable video, you can hardly leave your subject in the shot long enough before you have to move the drone and the video then tilts or moves the subject out of view. Secondly the resolution of the camera and the cheap sensor just produces an awful &#34;webcam from the year 2000&#34; style picture.<br />Running the video through the YouTube automatic stabilisation filter makes the video slightly more viewable but certainly not something you could use to promote your business, sports pitch or building.<br /><br />It's been a great adventure and now I'm itching to upgrade or &#34;graduate&#34; to a far more expensive drone with a stabilised and higher quality camera now I know how to control this low cost one. [ Phantom 4 anyone ;)? ]<br /><br />Summary: Grotty camera quality but a fantastic drone to learn on.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AH6CMXMLDROMF6JLWPI564JAES3Q,1460482910000,0,True

3684,5.0,Very stable and tough as nails!,"This helicopter all around is, in my opinion the best bang for the buck in the below $100 price range.  Believe me, I spent two weeks searching the internet for the best (and cheapest) option.<br /><br />-Build quality:  First of all, this thing is light and made out of flimsy plastic.  Do not let this discourage you!  I accidentally got this helicopter stuck in a tree and it sat up there for one and a half days through the hot Florida sun, light rain as well as intense humidity.  When it finally fell down it worked perfectly!  As cheap as this thing may feel it can really take a beating (did I mention it can take 100 foot falls onto grass fields).<br /><br />-How easy does it fly?:  This helicopter is extremely stable and anyone should be able to hover this within a few trys.  After a few days anyone should be able to make basic maneuvers with this machine.  I would recommend that this helicopter is good for anyone 12+.<br /><br />-Is it a toy?:  Technically yes.  This device is not anywhere near professional grade.  DON'T buy this if you want to do professional arial footage.  This device is not able to lift very good cameras (like a GoPro for example).  Even though it is classified as a ""toy"" I believe this helicopter is a step above a simple children's toy.<br /><br />-Who should buy it?:  Like I said above, I recommend that this is good for anyone 12+.  But anyone that is thinking about buying a more expensive helicopter some day should defiantly start out with this one to get the feel of flying a quad-copter.  Also for someone on a budget that can't afford or does not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a helicopter should defiantly consider this.<br /><br />-How high/far can it go?:  This device does not have a limit to how high or far it can go (besides the remote control range).<br />I would say that the remote control range is about 70-80 meters, otherwise there is not set limit of how far/high it can be flown.  If you want to fly high do it on a not so windy day because it gets windy high up and it can push this helicopter around a little bit.<br /><br />-How long does it fly?:  This device can fly for an average of 7 mins without using the camera.  With the camera you only get 3-4 mins.  Also if you are carrying something with it (like another lightweight camera for example) the added weight will reduce that flight time.  If you need longer flight time you can buy bigger batteries right here on amazon that can improve the flight time.<br /><br />-Is the camera good?:  First off it is not HD they say it is but it's not (remember this is only a $50 helicopter).  It is not professional by any means but you can still get pretty decent shots from in the air (the camera works better in the day time with light).<br /><br />***IMPORTANT*** To make sure you get the Syma X5C-1 model order from battery superstore I ordered mine from there.  Even if it comes in the wrong box it is the right one.<br /><br />IF YOU CAN ANY MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS DEVICE LEAVE A COMMENT TO THIS REVIEW AND I WILL ANSWER THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHE37RMTDVB633W7QOZBJK3E3U6Q,1432516150000,1,True

It stayed up in that tree for 4 days. In that time it poured rain,and took some bb gun fire, then a huge wind storm of 60mph winds came, and blew it clean out the top of that damn tree. I found it the next morning in a thorn bush patch. Unscathed.  I put battery in rice, let it dry out. Charged battery, and thing still works as good as when it arrived.

3744,5.0,Best Budget Quadcopter,"I bought the Syma X5C as my first quadcopter, both to learn how to fly and to lift payloads. I figured the price was right, and the X5C has great reviews. After flying the X5C I can understand why.<br />  First of all the quadcopter maneuvers very well. It is easy to get it to hover and is very stable. The X5C has two control modes: Low and High. The quad is easier to control in Low mode, but it flies faster and is more responsive in High mode. The X5C can fly very fast in High mode, and once I mastered the controls, it was a blast to zip around trees and obstacles at high speed in High mode. As per standard issue with these budget quadcopters, the X5C comes with an automatic 360 degree flip function. This maneuver actually does have a practical use, as it causes the drone to lose altitude while flipping; so if the carries the drone too high, performing several flips will bring the drone safely down to a low altitude. The drone handles wind surprisingly well, you can actually hear the motors compensating for the wind while the drone is hovering.<br />  The X5C comes with a decent on-board camera, with the same approximate camera quality as a cell phone from the early 2000s. This camera does NOT transmit video down to the controller (no FPV), however if you are looking for that functionality, an upgrade kit can be found on Amazon (just search for 'Syma X5C spare FPV' and you'll find it). The camera is triggered by the controller, and it records to an onboard MicroSD card, which is included with the drone. After the flight, simply plug the card into the reader (included) and plug that into your computer, and you can see your video/pictures. The quality isn't really too good, especially in low light conditions, but is decent enough for most applications (just DON'T buy this drone for use as a professional aerial photography setup!) Both the quadcopter and the onboard camera are powered by a lithium battery which is charged by a USB charger (included), which provides about 6 minutes of flight time (less if you fly your drone more aggressively).<br />  Overall this is a fantastic drone, with tons of potential. There are plenty of modifications that can be made at home to customize the X5C (just search 'Syma X5C hacks'  on YouTube), and the X5C can lift a small payload if the camera is removed. I ended up buying a few as gifts, and I spraypainted mine matte black. My only gripe is the use of brushed motors with a gearbox (as opposed to superior brushless motors) but for the price it is completely understandable.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AHGPYU3PJ2JZEK5ICPWJK4Z5VHNA,1446662395000,3,True

3813,3.0,Good drone if you get the right one,"Before I write this review, it is important to understand that there are at least two packagings of the X5C-1. Among other things, the boxing itself is different. Also, one packaging (I will call it version 1) has a problem with the drone running out of battery, in that the lights blink just as the batteries run out: no time to land. And, the micro SD Card is 2GB. The other packaging (I will call it version 2), corrects the battery issue, by giving at least 30 seconds to a minute (I did not measure it) of blinking before the rotors stop, and it comes with a 4GB card. With that said, here is my story.<br /><br />First, I love this thing. I am retired, and find I need a brand new set of skills to fly it. It does not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive drones that help you fly with a lot less skill. But this unit is what a beginner should start with, so they know exactly how to fly the drone on their own.<br /><br />So I purchased my first unit (it turned out to be version 1). After a week of flying, one of the rotors stopped spinning, so I returned it to Amazon, and purchased another. The next unit to arrive was version 2. I made the mistake of taking my eyes off the drone for a few seconds; I have no idea where it went and it is lost until the fall when I might find it in a tree. So I ordered my third unit. What came was version 1 but there was no SD card at all, the unit would light up, but the rotors would not turn. I noticed during unpacking that the drone was secured by only one strap not two.  So I returned it for my forth drone, and again I received version 1, and again no SD card, but this time the second strap was in the box, and apparently cut by someone. I surmise that someone had to cut the tie, in order to take the SD card out of the camera. Needless to say, this unit has been returned.<br /><br />So I have given up on Amazon, and purchased the drone (hopefully I will receive version 2) off of eBay. The ad on eBay explicitly talks about a 4k card, so I have a good feeling I will receive version 2.<br /><br />Additionally, extra batteries are a must and something to keep them in, just in case they catch on fire.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGMUVUWIZU5M74D3IGA77QP4IOWQ,1537367957167,0,True

3854,5.0,Great Fun on a Calm Day,"This quad is a blast! My first quad, the Syma X5C (mine came in the X5C box but it is the X5C-1) has never let me down. I liked it so much that I talked my son, my brother, and my nephew into buying their own so I wouldn't have to share mine so much. I bought a four-pack of batteries with the X5C as there is just no way that the single battery included with the quad is enough.<br /><br />I haven't had a single problem with my quad. We did have to change out a motor in my brother's quad, but his son was thinking ahead and bought a four-pack of motors (@ $10-$15), so there was very little down time. I wouldn't rate down on my purchase for his problem, but since I mentioned it, it would also be fair to add that my brother's first trick mastered was debarking all the live trees in his yard with the quad. :-)<br /><br />For my instruction, I watched a couple howto videos on YouTube and stayed pretty close (inside a hundred feet) until I got over--for the most part--the disorientation that is natural to a first-time flyer. My nephew just charged! Charged the battery and charged on to heights I wouldn't think an experience flyer would try. My nephew has also had to climb most of the debarked trees in my brother's yard to get his quad back also. But, he was laughing and having fun the whole time, and still has a perfectly functioning quad as I write this.<br /><br />Not only would I recommend this purchase but already have recommended several times to family and friends. ALL of the parts for this quad are available here on Amazon and for pretty decent price, just in case something breaks. The X5C comes with a spare set of props, but you will definitely want to buy more batteries. I am buying even more batteries and some spare motors because I can't stand the thought of sitting on the bench after an hour or so while the batteries charge.

I removed the camera and prop guards for more agility. I've lost power from 100 feet in the air and the thing has dropped on to concrete and emerged unscathed. It has also endured numerous crashes into every wall in my apartment. It feels improbably light, but that actually works to its advantage both for flight and impact resistance when it it falls from the air for instance. Still on my original set of props and it has whacked into all sorts of things and spun upside down on asphalt too many times to count (with no prop guards).

3919,5.0,Great Starter Drone and Gateway Drug/Drone,"I bought this as my first quadcopter drone and I have not regretted it for one minute.  It has been relatively easy to learn how to operate and after 2 sessions (using 2 or 3 batteries a session, so about 20 minutes a session.) i got the hang of it and began zipping it around the yard with confidence.  This drone feels super cheap and I halfway expected it to fall apart at any moment.  However, it has been a workhorse and has taken more than its fair shares of good crashes and hard landings and it performs flawlessly.  If you are learning for the first time, I highly recommend using the blade guards to prevent the blades from breaking from impacts.  I also recommend learning to fly in an open area with little to no obstacles.  I could only practice in my tree filled backyard, so my learning curve involved lots and lots of collisions with trees as I tried to master the navigation controls.<br /><br />I would consider this drone a gateway drug.  Once you get a taste of flying one of these and realize how much fun they are, you will most certainly begin eagerly looking looking forward to purchasing a newer, more expensive drone and you will lament the fact that you wont have time to fly it all day long.

4054,4.0,Better Get The Black,"[[VIDEOID:c1197d7446fdc13f21ed6c3b38bb751d]] Overall, this is a great quadcopter.  The range is great, it has amazing stability and the photo and video quality is great.  Yet only around a month after purchase, I lost it since I had no idea which way it was facing.  I ordered an extra battery when I ordered the quadcopter so I can fly it while the spare battery is charging.  So, I've came up with this:<br /> The design of the product is great, though when you hold the quad in your hand it feels cheap and easily breakable.  The wind can easily catch it since it's extremely  light, though you can usually take it out of the current.  It is very easy to control, and also very easy to get it stuck in trees!  I would have given this 5 stars, but the biggest problem is the color.<br />  The quad blends well into the sky as well as trees.  The white plastic blends in with the sky as if it was a cloud, and is hard to see when you get it stuck in fully leafed trees.  So that's why I say ""Better get The Black"" version of the Syma X5C.  You can see it better, I learned after I purchased it, and you will have a better chance of keeping it for a longer life.<br /><br />Written by Henry Shackleford, age 10.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AG2XD2GKT5CCHZVRZ63YEMDDEKXQ,1437418570000,5,True

4075,4.0,New Pilot Loves This Drone,"Such a fun little beginner quad!<br /><br />Learning to fly with this Quadcoptor has been so much fun!  It’s light and will get pushed a bit by the wind, but so far I haven’t flown in wind that this little thing couldn’t handle.  The one-touch flips are a lot of fun, and this thing is fast for it’s size!  As a beginner, you might never switch into high gear - it just feels really fast if you’re new to the hobby.<br /><br />Let’s be honest, you’re not buying this for incredible cinematic shots, and the camera isn’t incredible - it’s 2.0 megapixels on a platform lacking and kind of stabilization or a gimbal, so all you’re going to get is straight ahead, vibrating footage.  Having said that, I was a bit surprised that some shots were as good as they were.  It claims 720p, but with the vibration of the quad it tends to make still pics grainy.  However, video footage of further objects was decent.  Up close, it’s horrible, but the further away the subject is, the cleaner the video seems to be.  there is no FPV, so it’s really just shooting randomly for fun.  Most of the time I fly without the camera at all - the attachments are very easy to take off and replace.  Flying without the camera, prop guards, and landing skids on a still day got me somewhere around 10-12 minutes of flight time with the factory battery - depending on how many flips i did.  Lol  (I bought a 6 pack of upgraded batteries because this quad was so much fun, so now my total flight time is over an hour!)<br /><br />The charger isn’t bad at all - a simple USB cable that works with either my iPhone or iPad wall warts, charge time is around 75 minutes.<br /><br />The Quadcaptor is incredibly light - well under the minimum weight for required FAA registration.<br /><br />The only issue I’ve come across so far that wasn’t operator-error was that I’ve lost 2 of the LED light covers.  Granted, these were due to crashing, but I haven’t been able to put them back on - it seems like the plastic tabs holding the covers on are too flimsy to not break or bend when trying to replace the covers.<br /><br />The quad comes with a full set of extra props, too - that I luckily haven’t needed to use yet.  ;-)<br /><br />All in all, this is a GREAT little Quadcoptor for beginners, kids, or anyone starting out.  (Or just wanting to add another toy!) It’s very tough and durable for how light it is, very responsive to the controls, and at under $30 you’re not super worried about crashing it - which it would probably survive anyway!  I love this little guy, it’s so much fun to fly in the back yard, and it’s a great introductory tool for new and learning pilots.  This Quadcoptor has introduced me to an incredibly fun new hobby that I expect to be enjoying for years to come!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFXDDT667WTXWE4IPJN5G4ZCZBWQ,1530878574431,0,True

Then I turned the controller off and went to read the instructions. Came back a few minutes later and noticed the back of the controller was unusually hot. I took the battery cover off and the batteries were blistering and bursting. Just for fun (and to rule out a defective battery) I put another set of batteries in the controller while it was off the entire time and took the temp with an IR thermometer about 90 seconds later. The ambient temp was about 60F and the surface of the batteries was 120F.

Does capture sound, but not well since the propellers drown out any noise.  Be mindfull of the 7 to 10 minute run time because after that the gyros will malfunction and cause your drone to lisp to the left or right depending on which propeller will get cut off from power (learned that the hard way, as the thing flew into a neighbor's balcony on the 3rd floor.

I still have to pay my respect to what got me started. The best feature about this being a good beginner quad, is the range that this beast has(100meters). Don't deliberately try to test the range, but circumstances arise where all the sudden your drone is very far away. Without getting to involved with trig. I'll say this if the quad is 50 meters directly above you and 50 meters away(horizontally). Don't forget about the hypotenuse because that's the actual distance. I'll quit harping on that but keep that in the back of your head while flying. For the price, the speed is great, and a beginner doesn't need one that's too fast anyway. Once you've mastered it at top speed, the good thing is there are aftermarket motors. That will improve response as well as speed. The bright L.E.D. lights are very helpful at night and you will have no problem being able to tell what direction your're heading. Overall: In my opinion the best beginner quad anyone could ask for.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AF5L6VCVQI73QPWOUSN2GS53IH4Q,1476664258000,0,False

Even for the original price of $60, I think this a super good drone. I fully realize that it is a beginner drone with limited capability. However, I have been involved in the RC hobby for a few years now, and I have to RC planes that I fly. One of them is a HobbyZone Super Cub LP that I swapped out all of the electronics on. Now it has a Rimfire 42-40-1000 kV motor, serious servos, flaps, ailerons, bush wheels, and even scale lights. I mention this to state that I am not a beginner in RC, yet I have had a blast with this drone. It still works well and I still enjoy flying it. I've even flown it in strong winds and it handled it surprisingly well. I have had to replace some parts on it. I've replaced two motors so far.

4243,4.0,"Great Beginner Drone, Fun to Use! Drone Video Footage!","[[VIDEOID:3d16a32668c0d49564cb44e79aea3846]] Simply put, this is my favorite beginner drone I have ever owned, and I cannot stop recommending this drone to beginners asking which drone to get. I mean, with the amazing handling, fast or slow speed options and long battery time, no other drone can beat this one.<br /><br />Lets start off from the package. It came in a big box, and when opened, you can tell Syma put lots of effort into keeping the drone secure during shipping. The controller along with the drone came on one of the sides of the Styrofoam package, while under it came with the propeller guards and extra propellers just in case you need to replace the propellers for whatever reason. For whatever reason, my drone did NOT come with a micro sd card, so I had to buy one for myself, costing $10 extra USD. More information on this later.<br /><br />The remote has a very simple layout which the manual will explain to you. Very simple and easy. The manual holds lots of good information so I highly recommend reading it if you are a beginner. I teaches you the controls and what each button does, how to calibrate the drone and so on.<br /><br />The drone was MUCH smaller then expected, so please make sure to check dimensions before you buy it for no surprises! Now, I am going to give a simple pro and con list that people who are interested MUST know.<br /><br />PROS<br /> - Excellent handling. Easy to turn and move straight and back, as well as very easy to land and take off.<br /> - Quiet. The motors do not make any loud sounds. They are very quite.<br /> - Sleek. Very good looking and nice LED lights that blink<br /> - DECENT battery life. Around 7 minutes of battery life, you might as well buy extra batteries for $20 so you can fly your drone for longer! Trust me, you do NOT want to put your controller down!<br /> - Camera. I expected the camera to be junk, but it is very decent when recording videos. Just be careful and try not to touch the lens.<br /> - Spares. As mentioned before, there were propeller spares and blade guards which are very handy.<br /><br />CONS<br /> - Wind. Wind will push this thing around, even the smallest of breezes. I saw it being advertised as wind resistant, but I guess that wasn't the<br />case<br /> - Micro SD. Mine did not come equipped with one. So I had to go out and spend $10 usd more on this drone just to record video and take pictures.<br /> - Propellers. My propellers are weak, and cracked after hitting the wall of my house. Disappointing, but glad that it came with spares!<br /> - Calibration issues. My controller continuously disconnected from the drone, which was annoying. Just thought I should put this here.<br /><br />OTHER<br /> - If you lose your SD card, make sure when you buy a new one, format it to FAT32, and turn off quick format. Also, you will want to make sure it is NOT bigger than 8GB because then it will NOT be compatible.<br /><br />I will update this review as my journey continues!

My fault completely, as I took it up too high and the wind picked up and carried it away.  For a year and 4 months now I have been looking up into the tree reminded daily of my failure.  Yesterday low and behold the wind must of knocked it out of the tree and it was in the middle of my yard.  After being up in a tree all this time being exposed to snow, rain, and extreme cold I figured no way this thing will work again.  Brought it inside popped out the SD card and decided to see the video of that fateful flight was still there.  Sure enough there was a 10 minute video on the card with 3 minutes of flight time and 7 minutes of its view from the top of the tree.  The unit still looked pretty good still albeit faded from the sun so I figured what the heck, I charged up the battery and fished the controller out of my closet of shame.  The thing fired right up and works like a champ!  All and all this is a sturdy little unit and fairly easy to fly.

Flies incredibly high, I'd say about 250 feet is the highest we've gotten it. It takes great video for being a relatively low resolution camera, (it helps if you're good at flying it/keeping it steady). Easy to fly for beginners and fun to push the limits with experienced flyers. The craziest part is he got it stuck in a tree for like a month and it rained, snowed, and got down below 0 degrees out, and when it finally fell from the tree, it still worked perfectly!!! I would recommend this to all, and to definitely purchase some extra batteries to maximize your time flying it. Battery life almost 10 minutes on one battery.<br />Great, great product.

4259,5.0,The Copter That wouldn't die.,"This quadcopter, I acquired as a spur of the moment Amazon Treasure Truck purchase but by god. This thing is tough. It flies great is easy to control but the real big deal of this product is it's resilience. I was flying this guy in a park by Lake Washington and flew him a little to high and it was windy that day, so it being a light little thing it got pushed around in the wind. before I know it, it is pushed out of range. it controlled falls down and out of sight over the hill. I run after over the hill around some trees and see it as it barely goes down into the shallows of Lake Washington. Now at this point I have to decide wether or not to retrieve this guy from lack Washington in the winter. So I sit there and wrestle over the fact of littering, and all that jazz and I notice that it's red and green lights are still on underwater. I finally decide it's better if I don't leave my crap lying around in the lake roll up my jeans take off my shoes and socks and walk my way out to this guy in the lake. I manage to retrieve it pulling it out water venting out through it's pore and I take it home to dry off. The next day I go what the heck and start it up for a kicks and the Quadcopter still works 100% Camera, Everything. This is one beast of a copter.<br /><br />Now some bad parts.<br /><br />The Camera on this thing is crap. Taking a still frame is blurry and unreliable and only recommended for capturing photos of crypts.<br />The video capture is decent it gives you a decent video with great background noise of the whirring of Quadcopter engines, but the downside is that the camera's direction and pointing is kind of hard to control. I can attribute this to me being a amateur spur of the moment drone purchaser so maybe it's just me.<br /><br />If you're looking for a drone to have fun flying about for a bit, and capturing random videos of stuff, and is super resilient.

4273,2.0,"Good beginner Drone, But watach your flight times.","Not much to complain about, at this price point ($40) it flies and handles nice. I imagine the higher priced Drones do a much better job of what this Drone can do. But for a beginner or someone looking to dabble into this aspect its a nice start. My only draw back seems to be the lack of time this Drone gives you from low battery to shut down. So be aware of your time in the air an give yourself some wiggle room to safely land it.<br /><br />  Other then that if you are looking into this drone for a starter I would suggest the slightly bigger battery or 2 because the one included only gives you about 7min flight time and a 90min charge time. The slightly bigger battery gives you about 10min lfight time with a 60min charge time. Of course these times might improve with removal of camera, blade guards and feet. But im a novice so I kept those on.<br /><br />  Lastly I know age questions always linger and I would just like to say that my 9 year old nephew picked it up fairly quickly.<br /><br />  Edit: As of 10mins ago when I went to fly the Drone the controls had since flipped. Rotate right and left moved from the left stick to the right stick and fly left and fly right moved from the right to the left.

Attaching a video taken using a small AIO 5.8ghz FPV camera attached to the quad along with an additional 1S 350mAh lipo battery mounted on top of the quad.  Take care of the props and expect to replace them if they get a little roughed up.  If the props are in bad shape it may not have enough power to take off and you will wonder if there are other issues like battery power or bad motors.  Prop damage may not be visible either.

4330,5.0,HOBBY STARTER,"Great starter Drone!<br /><br />Overview: Coming out of the box this quad copter looks awesome. It took 5 minutes to put batteries in and away it went! The battery for the quad was already charged. The flight controls take some time to get used to but easy enough for beginners to learn. Charge time was only 1 hour so it can be used multiple times a day. Flight time varies (if you use the camera) from 7-10 minutes. If you are feeling daring, or have a good handle on the controls, you can remove the propeller guards and landing gear and maybe fly as long as 11 or 12 minutes.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Easy Controls<br />- I was able to fly the drone without crashing by the end of the first day.<br />- Turning on video is only 1 button and away you go<br />- DO FLIPS with just 1 button<br /><br />Wont Break<br />- I crashed a few times onto frozen ground, driveways, and into walls and there are not even scratches!<br />- Blade guards do a great job of keeping your drone from breaking as well as keeping it from breaking things in your house.<br />- I lost signal (went to high) and it falls gracefully. The propellers seem to slow the decent and keep it from smacking the ground.<br /><br />Simple Construction<br />- The blade guards, landing gear, and camera all come on and off with just a screw or two. (screwdriver provided)<br />- Battery and Camera plug in without any hassle<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Camera<br />- This is a replay only camera. You will not be able to see the video while it is happening. (Although some after-market upgrades are available)<br />- Video quality is only fair. You can see what you're looking at, but not with any clarity. (See attached Photos)<br /><br />Lifting/ Carrying<br />-You won't be doing any carrying with this drone. Simply for flying and video.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />This is the first drone I've ever used, but it makes a great drone for anyone looking to start a new hobby or if you want to try something fun without breaking the bank. If you think you might like any RC hobby, try this one first. Much easier to fly than planes or helicopters.<br />Good for ages 12+","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GO6mCb0wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GO6mCb0wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GO6mCb0wL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vz+GwH4uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vz+GwH4uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vz+GwH4uL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uG+U6Ca2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uG+U6Ca2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uG+U6Ca2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFVHDJKMZTGLDVCZOGLRMRDGWAQA,1452034473000,3,False

It had better than expected range on the remote. I found it  was well stabilized and very easy to fly. I'm an experienced pilot but I bought this syma X5C as a learning toy for my 10 year old daughter.<br />I also have previously owned a SYMA helicopter and found that one to be a great little flying machine for its price point.<br />The manual is pretty poorly written but all in all it seemed at first to be a pretty good purchase on par with my previous SYMA helicopter.<br /><br />The fatal flaw...<br />On about the 5th flight, I took it outside with both the drone and the controller fully charged. I started the camera in movie mode with a newly purchased 32gb kingston micro SD card, to record the flight. I lifted off to about 15-20'.  I pressed the button for ""high speed eversion"" and ""rudder"" as described in the instructions to roll it and the thing stopped responding to the controller.  It wasn't out of range. I have had RC vehicles for decades and this was different. Besides it was only 20' above me. The drone would just barely respond to control inputs. It was like every input was delayed and reduced by 90%. If you pushed forward it would wait a few seconds and then slowly tilt just a hair and move.<br />I tried pressing the ""eversion""  button again, nothing.  I tried to turn it...descend it....I tried every control there was...nothing!<br /> It kept slowly climbing and drifting with the wind to the back of the house. I followed it trying desperately to get it to respond but to no avail. There is a deep ravine behind our house, full of big, tall old growth trees.<br />The little X5c drifted across the ravine ignored my attempts to control it and found its final resting place just a smidge from the top of the tallest tree around.  The tree starts at the bottom of the ravine and goes all the way up to above our house. It must be 200' tall.<br />My daughter and I jumped in the car and drove around to the other side of the ravine but there is no recovering the X5C. Annoyingly I could still pair the remote and I could hear it rev up but it was lagging control inputs.<br />We gave up and drove back to our house.<br />Back in my yard, I could still see the little lights flashing away. I could even easily pair the remote but it was still doing that weird lag. No attempt to free it were successful.<br /><br />So now we are out a quad copter and a new microsd memory card.<br /><br />I wouldn't have been annoyed if my daughter had crashed it, or if I had crashed it by some mistake. Whats particularly annoying is it just stopped responding, due to some internal fault, and we had to watch it drift away in slow motion with no way to stop it.<br /><br />I really liked this quad-copter initially. Had it not glitched and drifted away, it would have been a 5 star purchase.<br />For 40$ I wasn't expecting a DJI quality drone.

4351,5.0,The Most Fun Thing I Have Bought On Amazon (Watch the video I made with this Drone you wont believe it!!!!),"I cant believe how much fun i am having for such a small amount of money. I was flying within a minute of receiving it from the post office. This little drone has a great range, its extremely durable, and quite fast. I have wrecked it hard several times and to my amazement it has been perfectly fine. I did totally blow out a motor while I was flying indoors (I had taken the guards off from around the blades as well). You can see the crash in the video I made, its the scene with the cats. Ironically flying 3ft from the ground indoors was much more dangerous than being 99ft high and plummeting to the ground. I was able to order a crash kit, it arrived within a week and I replaced the motor in about five minutes on my lunch break. I know have 8 extra blades, an extra body, extra lights, extra skids, extra motors, extra gears, and extra guards so I can destroy everything accept for the receiver board and be back flying again in minutes. The video is pretty good (see video below) people have have complained about the video quality are forgetting that they got this awesome thing for less than 40 bucks. Also some people have said that it stopped working for them after the second use, I guarantee that they were trying to make the controller connect while holding the drone. For some reason the controller only likes to connect while you are holding the controller and the drone is on the ground below it. I thought my drone was broken till I realized this is just how it likes to connect. I made a video that will show potential buyers what to expect from the syma x5c as far as video and flight capabilites are concerned. also there are tons of tips online about moding that camera, antenna, etc that are very helpful and cool. If you break your drone moding it you are only out a small amount of money its a win win. I could not be happier with this drone and with this company.

4353,3.0,i figured it was hard enough to fly as it was on L (there were some winds) just as i was about to call it quits i took my last b,"This is my first drone. saw some youtube ads and people swore by it. first time out i almost called it quits. i was flying mode L and the thing wasn't responsive at all. i knew it had another mode but it didn't dawn on me to try it right away, i figured it was hard enough to fly as it was on L (there were some winds) just as i was about to call it quits i took my last battery and put it on H mode and thats when i started to have fun. it's more aggressive and it actually turns and maneuvers on H. I went home and charged all the batteries up and went out later on once more. it was less windy and i had quite a bit of fun with it. i did drop it my first time out a few times and one of the led light covers broke off it (cannot find it as i didn't notice where it came off). that being said it was still my fault so i can't really give it bad review for that. the biggest issue i have had and the most serious to me is, there is no indication the battery is dead. on the remote there is a battery indicator but it only seems like it shows what state the battery is in when you first start it up. so if you start it up with a full battery and take it out for 5 minutes, the remote still shows it's full, then a minute or 2 later it's just falling out of the sky with no control of it at all. could be dangerous if you're flying near a body of water. i have a beach by my house and really wanted to fly across the river and such with it to get some camera views of it, but god forbid it dies doing that, it's done for. thats really my only complaint. also another thing worth mentioning but is not the drones design flaw is that &#34;aftermarket&#34; batteries do not fit well at all. i bought 5 batteries and they are a bit bigger than the OEM battery. you can force it in the battery tray but i have had many connection issues with the aftermarket batteries. i've had it lose connection and just cut off mid flight. if you're buying batteries for this thing maybe try to find them direct from syma which is what i'm going to look into.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AGR7NDBXL4PU6BR33DBSTSW42OJA,1496570331000,0,True

I'm here to say this is the best toy I've ever seen, for the price. It quickly became MY toy. There is a thing about figuring out how to sync and get the camera to work and i got my lessons from these reviews and youtube. mainly it has to be on a flat surface before it will sync. For the camera there is a switch that you need to move. one way takes a photo, the other way starts a movie. You need to stop the movie or it will not save. I flew this a few times a day for about a week then it got stuck HIGH in a tree for a month. During that time it rained, was hot, and windy some days. I got it down after a month using a tennis ball sling shot purchased on amazon for $20. i tied a sting to the tennis ball and was able to shack it down. it fell, undamaged. All the movies were saved just fine and it still works well. the remote hanles can snap off but still flyable. Best toy ever. Oh one more thing. it has a tendancy to quickly get out of range and may do odd things like go straight up. Don't fly it near tall trees. Find a wide open place.

I know this is a beginner quad but it really delivers a very nice &#34;first timer&#34; experience, it even flips!. My 11 year old got one for Christmas and he's having the time of his life. This quad has resisted many drops, hits and some rough flying for the past days and still is working very well. Camera works as expected and with very stable footage. The only thing I recommend is buying at least 2 more batteries to extend the flight time. Every battery lasts around 5-7 minutes and having only one battery will cause a lot of frustration. Consider that recharging each battery takes 1 to 1.5 hours. There's a lot of battery sellers, even Syma sells batteries as spares.

This is my first quadcopter/drone. It is extremely fun to fly and doesn't take very long to master. Even my wife has fun flying it! Camera takes decent video but pictures are just ok. One fallback to this product is its battery life. I highly recommend buying a few extra Syma 500m amp batteries. Battery only lasts for about 7 minutes of flight time. I just ordered 3 extra batteries. Make sure you order the Syma 500m amp batteries, not the off brand 600 or 750m amp batteries. They don't last any longer than the stock battery and are bigger so you have to modify the battery compartment in order for them to fit in the quadcopter.

We removed the battery after the first flight to charge it, after a couple of hours on the charger we attempted to fly it again, the drone would power up and sync up to the controller and then die.

4416,5.0,Straightforward review of Syma X 5 C,"Love this product it is the best for the price I bought mind a couple weeks ago and I'm very satisfied. This is a great beginner drone you can push it to the limit and it would not break unless you do something to crazy without its protectors obviously the more wear too it the more tear it have overtime... But I will write the drone 5 stars because the sturdiness and for the price you can replace the whole drone for about 27 bucks if you break it and you can upgrade the batteries easily just do research thoroughly and do not be fooled by fake comments. 1-13-16  TODAY the federal government ( The FAA ) issued a requirement to register drones weighing more than 250 grams ( which the X5C does NOT ). The requirement is backed up by threats of fines and prosecution. On the other hand, the FAA issues one registration to you for use on all your drones - which would help with lost drone recovery. Please read the official FAA info / registration page: http://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/ btw- the reg is $ 5.00 but currently refunded.

4418,5.0,Great little Drone !,"Ok, I will start by saying that I rarely like a product enough to provide a review.  I purchased the X5C for my son for Christmas in 2014.  Right out of the box it was a fun toy and quite frankly, exceeded my expectations for something in this price range.  That is not why I am providing this review however.  Late last summer I was flying it around the yard and got it way higher and farther away from me than I should have.  We live in the woods so there wasn't any concern with neighbors etc.  Unfortunately, it ended up about 75 feet up in a 110 foot pine tree.  It stayed there all winter through numerous rain, wind and snow storms.  I am in New England, these were some harsh storms....  Yesterday, (March 17th) we got hit with a powerful wind / rain storm that finally knocked this thing out of the tree.  I removed the battery and let the drone dry out.  This morning I put the battery on the charger, gave it a full charge, popped it back in the drone and after a couple of hiccups with the power switch (probably a little dirty and corroded), it is now functioning and flying as good as it did day one !  The only damage, one of the clear light covers popped off at some point and is missing.  The red decals aren't even faded.

4432,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS QUADCOPTER,"Wow. Very disappointed. I bought this quadcopter for my son last year as a Christmas gift. It arrived on time, and seemed like a great toy for a 12 year old. After about a month, the drone was in acceptable conditions, and my son was having a great experience. Soon after, we went to an open field to fly (no other drones over the same frequency were around) and his drone was fully charged. It's lights started blinking right away and it crashed very soon after. This repeated 4 or 5 times until finally two of the 4 blade protectors flew off the drone. We then screwed the protectors back on and tried flying the drone within only 10 feet of him, but same result. Plus, the reaction time was at least 10 times slower than normal. Also, even before these two problems occurred, the camera was not taking pictures or video, and the 4 GB. chip was 100% empty. To be honest, this is very disappointing. To troubleshoot these problems, I tried ordering new blades, new landing gears, new batteries, and new motors directly under the blades, none of which made any of difference. I then tried emailing SYMA about my drone 4 TIMES, and still haven't gotten a response. The fourth email I sent was on February 21, and nobody has yet to help me. I called the number listed for customer support on the product's website, and go figure the number didn't even work. Total disappointment.

IF I wound up crashing it, I wouldnt be out a lot of money.<br />2. Parts are really cheap for it(I got extra motors and batteries and spare props,landing gear etc and am still only out about 150 bucks).<br />3. The large majority of the reviews talked about how tough the little craft was and how well it held up to the abuse that the 1st time flyer was bound to give it.<br /><br />Well after 10 or 15 flights, I have to say this thing is awesome. Is it a DJI Phantom? NOPE But I knew that going in. It is however a great drone to learn on.

4455,5.0,Great quad for the money!!,I've had this quadcopter for about two weeks now and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into flying them. I ordered mine from battery superstore and did recieve the new updated version. It's a very stable flyer and easy to fly. The camera that comes with it is ok for the price you pay for this product and gives decent pictures and videos for the money. I've done over 30 flights so far and no problems at all. For the money you can't beat it :) I would recommend buying extra batteries so you can keep the fun going longer.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AlFu5LBcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AlFu5LBcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AlFu5LBcL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AEPA2K7USNC2BHVYH5RMV62Q73YQ,1444154450000,1,True

4461,4.0,Review and basic flying pointers.,"I just received mine as a gift earlier this month. So far I have only flown it indoors but it works nice and has already survived some crashes. I have a little bit of RC helicopter experience so it is easy for me to fly. There is an interesting youtube video on how to re-calibrate the rotors which isn't covered in the manual that helps to further stabilize level flight. Mine came with a micro sd card and a USB adapter. The manual says not to charge the battery immediately after flying and not to leave the battery charge more than 90 minutes. This may have been the cause of the problem a previous reviewer reported. As far as a flying pointer for beginners goes, keep the right hand stick in its center position 99.9% of the time. You only need to move the right hand stick slightly and momentarily in the direction you want the copter to move then move it back to its center position. It will continue to move in that direction until you give the copter the exact same stick movement in the opposite direction to make it stop traveling and hover again. Just use the up and down throttle setting on the left hand stick until you get the hang of moving the copter forward and backward, left and right using slight inputs on the right hand stick. Using the left hand stick to rotate the copter will jack up your sense of direction on the right hand stick so don't mess with it until you are comfortable with the right hand controls.",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AFMBE2RSKA5EVSJVVB6DJNZN6IRQ,1449524608000,0,False

This drone is absolutely amazing . I have had hours of fun and many challenges but along the way the drone handled like a champ. In fact, about two months ago my drone got stuck in the  top of 100 foot tall pine tree. It was up there for about a month or so and then blew out when hurricane Matthew came by. I cleaned it up and let it dry out for a day and it works like the day I bought it.

4484,5.0,Lasts through windstorms and falls - great all around buy!,"We bought our first one of these about half a year back (April 2016) and we were delighted. But, as with all flying toys that are outdoor, we lost it in a tree within a week. After trying to get it down for a while, we decided to order another one. Believe it or not, this one also was lost (never fly it high when it's windy out) and we tried to get it down - this time succeeding.<br />About 4 or 5 months later we had a large windstorm, and I was walking in our forest when I saw this white thing - the copter! It had blown down in the storm, but after all the dirt and rain, you wouldn't think a $60 CAD Amazon R/C would work, but surprise surprise! It's been about a week now and the thing purrs like a cat.<br />I highly recommend this toy to anyone with a limited price range -  you can look up reviews for it and it's rated 2nd best only to a $1000 high-tec copter. It has lots of options -  like stunt mode, where it is way more agile; low mode, which is good for indoor flying and low outdoor flying; and high mode, which controls well and has tons of power.<br />You can get this thing very high -  I'm going to guess up to 150 feet in the air.<br />The batteries last up to ten or fifteen minutes, depending how hard you push it. We got six more batteries with a six-battery charger separately on Amazon -  also a good buy (charge by USB which comes with).<br />I would recommend marking the end of the quadcopter which goes forward with a marker or tape or something, because during the day you can't see the red and green lights which distinguish the front from the back.<br />The camera is fair quality - it comes with a micro-SD card which sticks in the back of the camera.<br />I also recommend that you get an extra set of wings, wing guards, etc. (also on Amazon) because the wing guards wear down after time, or get bent and interfere with the wings.<br />This copter is also great for being tossed around - very durable and can stand lots of falls - low or high.<br />Amazing quality and a great all around buy!",[],B00MNG37C2,B00MNG37C2,AH73AWPS4P2OU7VBLAEHAMIPWSEA,1477798941000,1,False
