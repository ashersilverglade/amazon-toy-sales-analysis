5,5.0,Now this is a dollhouse!,"Forget the cheap pink plastic Barbie house! I'm so glad I bought this for my granddaughter! It is solid, well built and so gosh darn cute! Barbie and Monster High dolls fit! ( I was worried a bit, but not to worry, they fit just right!) Solid wood peices, even the walls! It goes together in about 2 hours. 28 steps to complete. Hardware isn't all mixed together in a plastic bag. Each different bolt or screw is in a hard plastic container that is labeled. Screws are color coded as well. Just need a phillips screwdriver to assemble. Instructions are thorough and Kidcraft even provides a hotline for help. The furniture is solid wood and cute! It was a bargain on Amazon, and if your prime, ships in 2 days free. When I was  a little girl, this is the dollhouse I always dreamed of. Granddaughter hasn't seen it yet, but I have no doubt she'll be thrilled! Huge, this is almost 5 foot high and 4 foot wide! Plenty of room for other kids to play! Sure is nice to recieve a high quality product that won't be trash in a week or two. I highly recommend!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEIGQI5GEMVKU2H4DDUG5CFAC4CA,1356277137000,0,True

It took us (me and my husband) about 4 1/2 hours to put it together.  I'd say it's &#34;ok&#34; as far as quality goes - BUT the garage doors still don't swing open right.

8,3.0,"Awesome dollhouse, disappointed in damaged pieces",This is a HUGE dollhouse.  I knew it was big from the dimensions in the product description; however you don’t really realize how big it is until you see it in person!  It seems to be made well with quality materials.  It is pretty sturdy.  I anticipate it holding up well for our three young girls.<br /><br />My husband assembled this on his own.  It took him about 4 hours!  He was a little frustrated as he felt the instructions could have been a little more descriptive or included better pictures.  Several times he found himself having to take something apart as he realized the pictures didn’t match up or similar things like that. Other than that it didn’t appear too difficult to set up.  I would recommend assembling it in a large space. We were able to easily move it to another room once it was assembled.<br /><br />My disappointment came about 3 hours into assembly.  My husband was putting the doors on and realized that they had water damage on them.  They were bubbles up and the paper/Design was lifting up on the edges.  I immediately contacte amazon to see if we could just get replacement doors.  I was told they unfortunately couldn’t do that.  We would have to disassemble the entire thing and return for a refund or for a replacement.  I was pretty disappointed in that since I wasn’t going to make my husband disassemble all that work and make him build it again when the new one arrived.  Amazon did give me a small partial refund for the damaged item but I was still pretty bummed I couldn’t get new doors for it.<br /><br />Overall we love the dollhouse and I’m pretty sure all 3 of our girls will love it too!  Just be cautioned - it will take you HOURS to put together and you could possibly receive a damaged piece and not be able to get just a replacement pieces.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xI2jT7ILL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xI2jT7ILL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xI2jT7ILL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHK363LYP7FNQDYPDWUA2W4GQKXQ,1513972994956,4,True

10,4.0,Nice!,I got this on sale and for the price it is great! I don’t think I would have purchased at regular price though. Everything about the dollhouse is in working order except for an area on the 2nd floor near the elevator. The floor wants to bend down a little and no amount of pushing it the opposite way makes a difference. So any furniture put there wants to slant downwards. Other than that it is a nice dollhouse and our daughter loves it. Putting together took about 2 hours and some of the instructions aren’t very clear. Husband said to pay attention to patterns on “wallpaper” and flooring and bolts are colored to match up correctly.,[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AH5AZM3BJRPMQAQKKVO5SWHNDIKA,1548597697045,0,True

I was genuinely surprised how all the furniture was real wood, and sturdy especially for a little girl. Very pleased with our decision.

15,5.0,Amazing Dollhouse,"We watched a Youtube video of a couple building this and we copied them as we went along, it helped a lot. Took about two hours to finish, and it helps if you lay the pieces in order of the number. My niece loves this, my other two nieces loves it as well and this dollhouse keeps them busy for hours. It's really huge and looks exactly like the photo. I especially love the price for the dollhouse, it is well worth it compared to other dollhouses that are smaller and more money. You can also get creative with it and put in some lights, bed sheets we made from fabrics sold at the store, also along side the dollhouse we put a little barbie pool set.

The instructions were below par in that way and they were missing one step which was minor and able to easily do at the very end without taking anything back apart. Overall I'd say it is easy to put together, just time consuming. Doesn't matter though. The end product is really nice and my 5 yo daughter is going to LOVE her dollhouse from Santa. The accessories are perfect for Barbie-size (12"") dolls and comes with furniture for a nursery which is great because she will be getting a Barbie Babysitting set also so she can use the baby stuff.

38,4.0,Beautiful but needs some improvement,"This is a beautiful dollhouse that should last a long time. I love the size, the sturdiness, the creative touches. The reason I’m not giving it five stars is because the print on the particle board easily begins to peel off at the edges. This happened readily while I was constructing it. I’m concerned it will get worse quickly over time so I may look into some ways to secure the edges for longevity. Also, I’m attaching pictures of some furniture pieces that were sent to me, which are clearly not wood as pictured but are cheap plastic instead (bathtub, vanity, nightstand, and refrigerator door). I’m very disappointed about this, because everything should have arrived as pictured with no substitutions. The bathtub and nightstand don’t even look like the ones pictured. Also, the instructions NEED to be in color, which they’re not.

We've had it for 3 months and couldn't be more pleased.<br /><br />They weren't kidding when they called this a mansion! You definitely need a pick-up if you are buying this pre-assembled. It wouldn't fit in the back of my Outlander.<br /><br />It's a great size for our 3 year old to grow into. She currently needs a step stool to get to the top level. I love all the details they put into it to look like s real home. I also enjoy the fact that this can be played with doll house people or Barbie size dolls. Very versatile that way! Not going to lie. When I set it up for my daughter, I played with it before she did. :)<br /><br />The Kidkraft customer service is fabulous! It was originally missing the stairs.

But when you first lay out everything, it seems a bit daunting.  But a little handy man knowledge  will go a long way towards putting this kit together.  There were times when you have to figure out how to get something together correctly.  The instructions lost me a little in assembling the elevator, I put some of the panels backwards, and had to redo it.  The garage door handles, some how I missed that step.  All in all it took about 2 1/2 hours of steady work to get it all together.  Sometimes a second set of hands is needed, especially in the beginning.  I used a electric screw driver, this saves a lot of time for this project.<br /><br />Final Product: Totally worth it, my 3 1/2 yo daughter loves it, was her favorite Christmas gift, she has to use a foot stool to reach the attic, it is very tall.

47,5.0,Barbie house,"Bought this for 5yo to play with.<br />First off, this doll house is HUGE. There are a lot of parts. But it took about 2 hours with just a screw driver and the provided Alan wrench to fully assembled.<br /><br />Second, there was a few issues I encounteted.<br />Some of the pre-filled holes were not there when to screw on the back design for the rooms (babys room). There was also excess glue that prevented the walls from sitting right. I had to clean them out to install.(garage area)<br />I moved the house before the instructions indicated to. Which resulted in me breaking a part. So i would suggest you don't move it until you're told to in the instructions.<br /><br />IMO, better material could be used. But when you take into the account the size this house is and the price. Then it's a good deal.<br /><br />The furniture is amazing, and there's still lots of room to add more. Which wouldn't be the case if it was a smaller house. You can also use full sized barbies, the furniture fits them as well.<br /><br />I have a younger child who tries to climb up this. Which would most certainly break the doll house. Something to take into consideration.<br />Note: This product does come with wall anchors.<br /><br />All in all, good product at the price. Will get many years out of it if it's taken care of.

70,5.0,"Sturdy, pretty, and fun at an excellent value!","To this day my husband and I marvel at how little this dollhouse cost in comparison to what you get.  For the price, the house itself is a real bargain, but the fact that you get so many pieces of furniture and accessories is unbelievable, truly.  One of the best values I have ever found when it comes to children's toys.  We chose to wait until Christmas Day to put it together rather than try to do it Christmas Eve (thanks to some of the advice found here), and are glad we did so because it took a while.  BE CAREFUL - this box comes unwrapped (no brown paper) and has a picture of the dollhouse and explicit descriptions of what is inside. I was grateful it was left outside the front door and my kids didn't see it ahead of time.  Make sure you have a space to hide it though - we have a big house and had to think for a long time about where to keep it until Christmas - the box is big.<br /><br />I'm a little confused by the age range - it states it is for ages 36 months - 7 years, but children will love playing with this LONG past 7 years old.  It's clearly built for Barbies to fit, and Barbies are often enjoyed by kids up to 13 (my daughter doesn't play with Barbies, but does use it for stuffed animals).  It puts the Barbie Dreamhouse to shame (something I ached for when I was about 9-10 years old).<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this dollhouse - keep your eye on it and watch the price. At the time of this review, the price is about $150, but when we bought it - two weeks before Christmas, even - it was hovering right above $100.

76,4.0,Great Doll house,"Great Doll house, large size, love the fact that it comes with the furniture.  I build this dollhouse in about 3 hours with my daughters trying to play with it while I was building it. It was not difficult to follow the included the instructions.  I think that this is a great concept and a great house all together.  There are a lot of items to play with and this keeps my daughters busy for hours.  It does, however, have a few flaws.  The materials are cheap, the whole house is basically made out of thick cardboard and the edges are all fraying and peeling.  I would have rather paid $50 dollars more and got this house made out of thicker and better quality materials.  I had one level completely rip out while building it and I was following the directions.  I am pretty handy and was able to glue this level back in using Power Grab sealant.  There was no picture of the finished product anywhere in the box, this would have been handy as a reference point.  Overall it was easy to build and looks great now that it is complete, the quality of the parts is what took the star away for me, I'd give it a 3 to be honest but the sheer size and so many items included is what makes it a great product.  Another concern for me is that the house is top heavy, there is a kit to attach it to a wall, but I want the option to move this house around my house.  Time will tell how well it will hold up, overall a great product with some imperfections that need to be improved.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEDF7XFNHMUQJNOO6DZZCIPTQN4Q,1523637609523,0,False

84,4.0,Don’t wait until the night before to put together,"Update! This thanksgiving, nearly a year of play later, my toddler informed me of a screw she found.  When asked where she found it she showed me the garage area of her doll house. Sure enough, one of the screws had fallen out of the door hinge so I suggest you check every few months. Other than that her little house is still going strong.<br /><br />Overall great product but I don’t know what I was thinking buying this for a three year old. She’s going to need a step stool to reach the top two floors. Mommy went overboard! As for the product itself, it’s huge and for the price a rather sturdy doll house. However, the wall and roof decals are fraying away from some of the edges right out of the box and a few pieces, a side wall of the garage structure and a few pieces of furniture, were also unglued but nothing a little gorilla glue couldn’t fix. Also, some pieces of furniture appear sloppily glued together. Another downfall was the sink was attached backwards so I’ll have to rip the sink fixture off down the line and re-attach it but I doubt it’s anything my 3y/o will notice or care about. I suppose I just expect everything to be 100% when paying this price. Of course mommy and daddy cracked a few seems screwing things in so I’d suggest going lightly on the screws while putting everything together and, though painstakingly slow, don’t use power tools even if it gets things done quicker. Give yourselves 2hrs to put together and use everyone’s pics on the reviews to guide you because although the directions were somewhat clear, there are no clear pics to follow when dealing with decal sided walls and color coded screws. Your best guess will probably be the right one when it comes down to it. And a drink for mommy and daddy during the building process doesn’t hurt either. May have saved our marriage. You could always just play it safe and build it solo though lol. Good luck!  I’m sure my little one will love it Christmas (tomorrow) morning.

102,5.0,Best Dollhouse I've Seen!  If I could move in I would...,"I was a little nervous about purchasing this dollhouse after reading reviews about assembly, and quality.  I can now say after assembling the dollhouse (roughly 3-1/2 hours with another person), I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with my purchase.  The detail of the dollhouse and included parts (table and chairs, clock, piano, beds, lamps, etc.) is incredible.<br /><br />Assembly: I would recommend assembling with at least one other person.  I used a regular screw driver, but also a power drill to speed things up a bit.  The screw holes tended to line up well, but this is where having the second set of hands is imperative, as someone to hold while the other one assembles is key to having everything match up.  There's nothing worse than having screw holes not match up!  Also, the screw heads are color coded, which makes assembly easier (ie. blue screws go with the blue roof, yellow screws to the sides of the doll house, etc.)<br /><br />Quality: Overall, this could be a heavier duty product (it is particle board, and thick cardboard), but when taken into account the amount of detail, size of the doll house, and price, I think it is DEFINITELY worth the purchase.  It did come with some scratches and a few pieces of the wood were slightly frayed, most likely an issue created during shipping.<br /><br />Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this product.  My daughters (nearly 3 and 5) LOVE it and play with it daily.  You may want to consider getting a safe stool for younger/shorter children to stand on, as the doll house is tall (almost 4-1/2 feet!), and smaller children may be unable to reach the top floor, which is the nursery - my daughters' favorite place to play!  I am VERY pleased with my purchase, as this doll house can accommodate Barbie size dolls, but offers more/is much more attractive than the Barbie dream homes, in my opinion.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BO6F9RTUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BO6F9RTUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BO6F9RTUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FRnT58MJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FRnT58MJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FRnT58MJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AES7TP25MMQQQWJCTZXK4GM7REHA,1577576791683,0,True

126,5.0,Large beautiful dollhouse,"I was a little nervous to buy this just because there were many mixed reviews. Some saying it was bad and many saying it takes a long time to put together & is difficult. I decided to buy it mostly because it seemed to have the most longevity for my toddler to grow with and get the most use out of. Plus it looked very nice. All the parts arrived just fine, looked great. There were 4 small boxes full of furniture which I think is awesome. It did take a long time to build yes but it is a massive dollhouse so it makes sense it would take a while. I put it together by myself. I didn't realise how big it actually is. I am 5'3 and the roof comes up to my chin for reference. My advice is when you are following the instructions keep referencing the picture they provide on here so you can check which way everything is supposed to be facing and what panels actually go where so you don't make any mistakes. The instructions are all black and white and that is what made it difficult. Overall I think it is a fantastic dollhouse 100% worth the money for the size and what you get.

The furniture has also is holding up wonderfully. My puppy got ahold of one of the tables though. There are details on this dollhouse that may be easy to overlook too. The crib and beds have 'bedding' on them, and there is also a pigeon painted on the outside of the house which is a nice touch. The stairs don't stay on for me though. But my kids play pretty rough. My sons also play with it too. My littler kids can't reach the top. My 6 year old can, but the others cannot. Also, the elevator was really, really hard to move. We just oiled it a bit and it works fine now. You definitely want to anchor this dollhouse to a wall.

The instructions are SUPER easy to follow as well!<br />It took me approximately 3hrs to assemble give or take a few min.<br />The picture I included with my review includes my 9 year old daughter... No, she's not short for her age either, she's about average with the rest of the kids in her class... That's just how huge the dollhouse it!  We're both completely in love with the dollhouse also.<br />Its insanely sturdy!!! One of the main things I'm so ecstatic about. I also love that because its so big, it actually comes with wall mounts to help prevent any accidents from happening and preventing it from toppling over onto your babies.

169,4.0,"High Quality Dollhouse, Low Quality Instructions!","Took me about 3-4 hours to build this, taking my time, laying out all the parts neatly to start, and carefully following the lousy instructions!  (If I built another I could do it in less than half that time).. The black-and-white (and pretty cryptic) picture-based instructions were definitely lame:  With a lot of the pictures, I had to keep staring at them for quite some time before I finally ""got it"".  (And I tend to be very methodical and meticulous when building things).. It was ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL (for me, at least) to go online and bring up a large color picture of the completed house on my laptop that I could refer to as I went along, so I could see how completed assemblies were supposed to look, and which parts were supposed to go where.  ALSO VERY IMPORTANT:  Have some favorite music playing while you build this-- It'll help calm your nerves as you fumble through some of the assemblies!  BOTTOM LINE: It's a solid dollhouse, unbelievable size, detail and quality for the money.  I only have one gripe:  My daughter's Barbie car doesn't quite fit in the garage-- the garage doors have to be slightly ajar with the car in there.  But my daughter doesn't care-- She loves it.  I subtracted 1 star for lousy instructions-- A house this nice should have instructions of matching quality.  But once it's done, the end result justifies the frustrations!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I looked at some of the other reviews of this dollhouse and noticed that several people recommend gluing the pieces together..One word:  DON'T!!!!  As mentioned, some of the instructions are a bit vague, so (as I did once or twice) you may wind up having to back up a couple of steps because you realize you assembled something backwards or some such thing.. So, what if you glued your incorrect assembly nice and tight? Maybe you even left it overnight to dry good and solid?  Whatcha gonna do???  Kill yourself, exactly!  The screws make this solid enough, and I find it to be very sturdy without any glue at all.  Plus, what if you someday want to disassemble this, at least partially, to store it, or if you move?

Your daughter's barbies will fit beautifully in this house and on the furniture.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is to be careful with the elevator and really it is not a problem, ours has not break, but it is just a good idea for your child to hold her/his hand under the elevator when he/she uses the knob to push up or down as it just seems to be the only weak area of the whole house, and again, probably not an issue.

The bed has a little mattress, the couch has a cushion, the kitchen counter has curtains on the bottom of it, the refrigerator opens and has a shelf..there is a rocking bassinet for a baby!! ...yeah... I'm jealous of my 7 year old daughters birthday gift! It is made of wood and a pressed wood. We will see how it holds up. I will update in a few months.<br />Putting it together was not hard, but it was not the easiest thing to do. I would recommend using a drill (slow and easy!) It is easiest to put it together with 2 people. The instructions are only photos. Poorly designed photos of what you are supposed to do each step. Obviously it can be done, but it is a bit confusing. Just make sure to watch carefully to what you are doing and think ahead. You can do it! Your kiddo will love this! I feel like it could be easily customized as well, if you wanted to make it your own little dollhouse, it would be easy to wrap with wallpaper or maybe paint? This reminds me, I am somewhat disappointed in the quality of how well the current wallpaper or design wrap is placed on the wood. It peels VERY EASILY from the edges. It is not glued down well. At least mine is not. But a little tape, glue or maybe even an epoxy would help.<br />I am very pleased with my purchase!

I purchased this in early December. Eventually the price almost doubled so be aware.  Was not too time consuming to assemble. My husband did have to redrill a couple of holes. He also left the garage disconnected for easier transport.  Once it finds its final destination her daddy can screw the garage back on. She is tall yet the house is taller.  The furniture is awesome and somewhat intricate.  Barbie and Skipper dolls fit in every room standing up except the attic nursery.  I am certain this house will provide hours of fun for many years (and possibly generations) to come.

There are several parts with the same part letter but different colors, the instructions do not specify which color to use.  Several parts have two sides and the instructions do not tell you which side to use. I had to reference the pictures on Amazon several times to know which side shows.  That is the only thing I would change on the instructions I wish they let you know which color to use and which side needs to be facing up but like I said earlier if you use common sense and take your time  you'll know that the floor for example should be facing up with a brown screw.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LA+jNSFzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LA+jNSFzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LA+jNSFzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFRQPKCRQ4CZSFFI46KGNJ3IZ4KQ,1642383367296,0,True

270,5.0,HOURS of Entertainment!,"My girls (5 and 2) love Barbies and Disney Princess &#34;Barbies&#34;.  So, I knew for Christmas this year that this would be the ultimate Santa gift. This is WAY cheaper than the Barbie Dream house and in my opinion MUCH better.  It is not tacky or made from cheap plastic.  It took my husband (an engineer) and I 3 hours to put together on Xmas eve.  Yes, the instructions are awful and don't show which side of the pieces should be facing which way so we had to redo a few parts.  But, they were all basically big chunks and not 100 tiny stickers or pieces.  The furniture is awesome and very sturdy.  Only 2 pieces of furniture had to be assembled: the bed (with screws) and the piano (just pegs you stick in for legs).  Over the last 3 days I have fixed the piano about 43 times, because my 2 year old thinks its fun to take things apart. So, today the legs got crazy glued on and I Modge Podged the piano keys sticker that also kept getting ripped off. All of the other furniture seems to be very tough.  I did also get a Barbie convertible and when in the garage the doors don't fully close but the kids don't seem to care.<br />This is huge and if you have more than 2 players, there is plenty of room for both to play without fighting over anything.  It will be years before the 2 year old can reach the top floor and honestly, its still a bit too tall for my 5 year old to really even play up there so I know it will get years of use.

And the items were packaged like this. The box was not damaged. I didnt include all pieces damaged in pics and yes the damaged parts did tear easier when assembling. And caution,  even if it is mainly wood, the house is large and flimsy and it tears easily. When assembling. Have tape or glue ready.<br />Edit: putting it together is a 2 person job with all the turning you have to do of the item. I did rip and have to glue one wall that the instructions didn't have both sides already screwed in when going to the next step. You actually had to skip ahead 2 steps to finish that wall. I suggest to skip around and do steps out of order so you're only working on putting together one side of the house at a time. The house is large. It is as tall as me when half assembled (over 5 foot). Also, save yourself some blisters and own an electric drill. Some of the holes are not predrilled correctly, and it took me about 4 hours to do it manually. Lastly, the instructions do not have any parts labeled top or bottom. You have to do a lot of guessing with both sides being decorated (the instructions are in black and white too). I had a lot of oopsies to unscrew because I realized I put something on upside down. Have patience with this if its your first time building a doll house!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GaARHTgqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GaARHTgqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GaARHTgqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XbCbbTfrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XbCbbTfrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XbCbbTfrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61syPnLvsCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61syPnLvsCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61syPnLvsCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Egvvc5bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Egvvc5bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-Egvvc5bL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R48AaPgEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R48AaPgEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R48AaPgEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFBWQ3MDEXOHLPKLYJTH43EA6LJQ,1604103745493,0,False

It took me 3 hours to put it together and I’m pretty handy. Within a week the floors had warped. The doll house is in her bedroom in a dry, heated home. There is no reason for warping. I contacted kidkraft. They sent me some link and garbage to fill out a warranty claim FOR EACH PIECE. Then I have to wait for them to arrive and TAKE THE WHILE HOUSE APART to fix it. So we’re talking at least 6 hours of work on top of the time to navigate their cumbersome warranty claims. My daughter is so disappointed! This is our 3rd kidkraft house.

319,5.0,Beautiful quality and excellent price,"I purchased this dollhouse for my daughter's 3rd birthday and could not be more pleased with my purchase! Between the free delivery from amazon,  the excellent customer service from kid craft and amazon when one of the pieces needed replaced because there was a missing pre-drilled hole, and the design of this house, it's a real winner.<br />I put this together by myself in 2 hours- the directions were missing from my box, but the kid craft website has everything you need and is very user friendly, so I set up my iPad with the directions on it and went to town. One point ill give is to leave the screws a little loose until you are completely assembled so the top floor has a little give- it was harder to get together at the end until I loosened a couple of screws.<br />We use this for Barbies and it is a thousand times better in looks, quality and durability than a Barbie dream house. Its tall!! My little girl cant quite see the top floor to play with it, but this is something she will use for years and theres plenty of other rooms for Barbie anyhow. It's in her bedroom and matches her decor very nicely- it's pretty enough to be on display with everything else in her room. The wooden furniture that is included with this house is very well made. I'm very impressed with this and just cannot get over the price difference on amazon from other sites, as well as the fact that this is less than a Barbie house at toys r us and is so much better.

343,2.0,"Peeling apart EVERYWHERE! Drips of glue, poor directions","Spent many hours (as expected) to put this together. During the process I kept coming across COUNTLESS areas where the paper/design was peeling off/fringed and areas that should be white but we’re scratched and black. The knobs to the staircase were dripping with glue that had hardened. One of the pieces of the roof doesn’t close completely to meet the other piece and match the other side. It would have been nice if they explained in the directions what “colored” screws went where. Some were obvious but others were not which resulted in the correct screws being used but not the correct color because by the time you find this out you can’t go back and undo everything just to change one color screw! If you like things perfect  and looking nice this is aggravating especially after putting SO much work into it AND spending almost $200. For the price and the amount of time to put this together it should be PERFECT with directions that don’t leave room for error. My daughter was beyond excited to get this for her birthday so I couldn’t just stop and say let’s put this WHOLE THING back the way it was, MAIL IT BACK and then wait to see if we get a better one in a few WEEKS. The one she had before this one didn’t have any of these issues by the same company. This one will not last because it’s going to continue to peel apart.

349,5.0,Magnificant!,"We purchased the KidKraft Majestic Dollhouse for my 3.5 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves another doll house she has, and using her imagination, so we thought this would be a great fit. So far she loves it! The size is just right for Barbie sized dolls, and also some random ponies and other things she puts in there. There is a lot of space for her to play and I am so happy to see her enjoying this gift. She makes up little scenarios with the dolls (Ariel doll is having lunch at the kitchen table with the penguin) and its wonderful to see her being so creative and engaged.<br />The dollhouse itself is extremely well crafted. All the little furniture pieces are sturdy and nicely painted. My only tiny complaint is that this is a bit time consuming to put together. My husband is very handy, and it took over 3 hours. Note to self: do not put together elaborate Christmas gifts on Christmas eve! But, it came together nicely and we are very happy with it.<br />I hope my daughter enjoys this dollhouse for years to come. Highly recommended!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uUYg739iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uUYg739iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51uUYg739iL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHQBEVAJPFNJLOX5BTV7HNL6WEYQ,1356704850000,53,True

Assembly of this dollhouse will be extremely frustrating...but the dollhouse is really large and very nice!<br /><br />Before you purchase be aware of the following challenges and you'll be fine:<br /><br />We read reviews that putting this dollhouse together would take about four hours...this is 100% accurate (if not longer) due to the very basic instructions.<br /><br />Anticipate that some of the holes won't line up easily, which will be a challenge...but with a little force, you'll be good to go.<br /><br />Unfortunately we are missing some pieces (#5...part of the elevator). We have to contact kid craft to have them send out the missing pieces. I had read this happened to another buyer as well.<br /><br />Hopefully our girl will believe that ""Santa's elves"" will be delivering the missing pieces in a few days! I guess her dolls will have to take the stairs...maybe I will make an ""out of order"" sign.<br /><br />Even though the assembly is a challenge, I still think this is a good purchase.

I was quite impressed with the quality of the furniture, and surprised it was not extra.  The interior walls are thin, but as long as you are not moving it around, it should strong.

The elevator is fairly easy to use (my seven year old has no problems). Assembly took me about three hours and did have some moments where I wished I had a helper.

It took me a little less than 3 hours to build, from opening the box to completion, with a little help from the little ones unwrapping all of the accessories. Now for my gripes... The instructions lack significant detail, there are no words, they are in black and white, and change scale frequently, causing unnecessary confusion. There are colored screws, but it does not tell you which color to use where! It is also difficult to tell which side of the panel use. Luckily the pictures on Amazon were high enough resolution that I could use them as reference. I would highly recommend having this handy when building! Lastly, given how well-built​ the remainder of the house and accessories are, the stairs are very thin, cheap, flimsy, plastic, they cut a corner here, a missed opportunity for an otherwise very high-quality product, f you ask me.

I didn't give it a full 5 stars because of some minor issues I found during and after the build. A couple of the smaller furniture pieces weren't perfectly put together and I was expecting perfection. Instructions could have been better too, for example; list what side of the panel you're looking at... especially during the beginning of the build. Having said all that, the rest of the furniture pieces were great and the house itself was great. Everything is very detailed. I recommend this dollhouse if you have the room.

Nice detail, nice paint, everything is really well done. So why 3 stars? Well, first, the instructions are horrible. When I started putting it together I noticed that there were not pictures but outlines in the instructions. The problem with that is most of the walls on the house have two sides. So outlines don't show you which way it should go. I spent the entire time looking at the pictures on Amazon to know which way things should face. And not only that, often the instructions were wrong. The outlines we're facing the wrong way. You could tell this because holes were on the wrong side for the painting on the wall. Then there is the &#34;fit and finish&#34;. There were holes completely missing from walls and floors. I had to break out my Dremel tool to create holes for the stair railings and the wall with the garage at the bottom. And lastly, quality control. The wood support for the third level floor next to the elevator is bowed. This caused the floor to pull away from the back wall and hang down. I had to glue it together with Gorilla glue. And the piano keys decal was glued across the top of the piano. It looked like the packed it before it was dry and it slid off and stuck to the top. I have since corrected all of these issues and my daughter loves it. So if you are willing to make corrections and take your time, this is a great doll house.

I had no issues getting it from my office to downstairs to the playroom upstairs because I made it strong. I am convinced if we tried to move it without my repairs it would have fallen apart. That was the worst of it but not all. The paper pictures were peeling up on the corners right out of the box, I had to glue them down. Some of the floor pieces are very bowed, nothing I can do about that. The instructions are like Ikea instructions. Line drawings, no text. Download the BILT app for free and find the dollhouse on there. 3-d interactive detailed GOOD instructions. After my experience with this I would give the Bilt app 5 stars and the doll house 2.

492,5.0,I could kiss whoever packed this!,"No, really, I would kiss whoever packed this for shipping! Our dollhouse came double boxed (no pic on the outer box, so it hid the present) and thank goodness for that double box. The shipment came to Missouri from Texas, and I'm pretty sure UPS drug it behind the truck the entire way. This thing was BEAT UP! There were holes all through the outer box, and the dents! I was so sure the house as destroyed that my husband and I went ahead and opened it to check for damage. That's when we discovered the actual boxed product was inside (this one does have a large colored picture on the front, which is important later) Even the original boxed was beat up from UPS. Yup, the holes managed to get through two boxes. Way to be professional, UPS. The good  news is that the house was in perfect condition. Thank goodness! It is very well packed, obviously.<br /><br />Since we had pieces everywhere, we decided to put it together even though it was a bit early for Christmas. It took us about 3 hours together and was pretty easy. The instructions are clear, and the colored picture on the box helped confirm we were on the right track -- not to mention furniture placement.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />1) Don't tighten the screws too tight. Some of the wood is thin, and we noticed cracks starting. Don't get me wrong, this thing is SOLID. It won't fall apart. But there is no need to tighten each bolt to the extreme.<br />2) Use a bit of oil on the elevator sliders before attaching. The elevator slid rather easily, but the oil really helped it to glide. Don't skip this part, it's worth the minute.<br />3) A power drill will reduce construction time. We would have had this thing up in 2 hours,  but the kids were asleep and we didn't want risk waking them.<br />4) Give yourself plenty of time. Even though it's really straightforward, this is not something you want to wait till midnight to start.<br /><br />As for the dollhouse, it's beautiful. Really. Well made, sturdy, and HUGE! The furniture is large, bigger than you'd think. We haven't done the whole ""Barbie"" mess in our house yet, but I know it's coming. This house will fit Barbie, when the time comes, but for now I bought the family of 7 wooden dolls. They are on the smaller side, but I feel they fit the furniture better. Plus, my 2 1/2 year old can manipulate them easier. Also, if your worried about the house tipping, it comes with wall attachment hardware. This house is so so so worth the little extra money -- especially when compared a plastic dollhouse.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGUD6ECYJWYZ233JSJV3Q6Y2RCBQ,1349981131000,1,True

Can't go wrong with this one as long as you put 3 hours of building time aside. Make Sure you look @ the building instructions closely to make sure things are facing the correct direction!

580,5.0,Great quality excellent toy - Daughter loves it!,"We purchased this doll house as a Christmas gift for our daughter.  She'd played with these huge doll houses at a local place where they host birthday parties, but never had anything like this at home.  Having ordered it a few weeks before Christmas, it arrived and I moved it to the basement to put together, knowing she would be down there.  It goes together fairly easily.  Here are a few observations.<br /><br />* There is a lot of attention to detail:  Some of the screw heads are actually painted different colors so that they blend into whatever wall they're going into.  You have to decide for yourself when to use painted screws or silver, but it's a nice touch.<br />*  There are a lot of screws included, but don't let that scare you - they all make sense once you get through building<br />*  It's not difficult to put together.  You don't need to be a professional handyman.  Some moms have posted here about their success in building it and I would wholeheartedly agree and encourage any parent to order this with the confidence that they'll be able to assemble it.  It's more like a 3d puzzle than a construction project.<br />*  I put it together in 2 separate one-hour assembly sessions.  I was extra careful not to damage any of the wood or scratch anything.  It helps to have an extra person around to hold it up while you're still getting the basic structure of the 4 floors put together.<br />*  The elevator is cute, but the track is pretty tight, making it hard for our toddler to move it up and down.  Good news is, she doesn't care.<br />*  The garage doors can flap open by themselves...  nothing that can't be fixed with cheap magnets<br />*  The overall quality of how all the pieces are made and how they fit together is very high - this is a well made toy and not a carelessly mass-produced kit.<br />*  I've already ordered some cheap LEDs to add some actual light inside the house.<br />*  There's an impressively complete set of wooden furniture included, which really adds to the fun.<br /><br />The thing to keep in mind - it's really a giant thing.  My daughter can only see/reach as high as the 3rd floor.  The 4th/attic floor - which is supposed to be the baby's room - is unoccupied at the moment.  She's fine with it because a large part of the fun is rearranging the furniture.  Also, being so large, getting it up the basement steps was pretty tricky.  We had to experiment with a few different angles and my wife had to help carry it.  It's too heavy and large for one person to do steps with, but I could lift it a few inches and move it across level floor pretty easily.<br /><br />*  Speaking of lifting it - use the side windows of the main part of the house as handles when lifting and you'll be in good shape.  Don't lift using the garage/porch section at the left!<br /><br />On Christmas morning, our daughter came down the stairs in complete amazement when this was under (actually next to) the tree.  It's found a permanent spot in her toy room and actually looks great.  It warmed up the room and added some height in what was pretty much a room full of toddler-size toys.  She loves it and it's part of her everyday routine already.  Hopefully she'll get years of mileage out of it as she grows into it and discovers more ways to play with it.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHLY3MCYDHXQMQMAHBHF67K2EDHQ,1484270790000,9,True

Im 5'4 about 135lbs and I could move it around the room very easily and pick it up (improperly) when I needed to. It is a huge playhouse so if you are carrying it to another room or something you will need help b/c the dimensions will prevent you from being able to wrap your arms around it. THe colors are nice, it comes with plenty of furniture, almost too much furniture and you can fit a barbie car in the garage, you just wont be able to close the doors.

584,5.0,Great-Please read this first!,"Great dollhouse. My niece loves it. Received 12/27/19, too late for last year. Kept unopened until 12/24/20 (this year) and almost went into shock with all of the pieces. Luckily, an angel on YouTube (How to’s by Mama) gave step-by-step instructions on how to put this together right the first time! She tells which sides go up (down), what color screws to use, etc. without her, I would not have realized the pitfalls until after the house was assembled. Do yourself a favor and watch her video!  You’ll thank me/her.<br /><br />Now for the house. I was impressed that Kidktaft put enough thought into this to even color the top of the screws to match each room, the garage and the roof.  The boards are somewhat thin, but sturdy. I was pleasantly surprised to see that all of the furniture is made of wood (not that plastic stuff).

585,5.0,I was fortunate enough to get two of these from Amazon when ...,"Wow!!! I can hardly wait for Christmas so I can see the look on their little faces! Just the size alone is impressive. Add to that the sheer quality and beauty of the decor and you'll be over the moon. But if that's not enough for you the wooden furniture will blow your mind! I was fortunate enough to get two of these from Amazon when it was only $129. Heck, I used a code when I ordered the second one and it was even cheaper and I got a family of seven for free! Assembly was not difficult. It didn't matter that three were only pictures. I did have to look at pictures of it on Amazon to ensure I was using the right part, but I only did that twice. It's great that the screws are color code for. Kidkraft really takes pride in their products. I had two pieces with very minor damage. I mean so minor you'd really need to have it pointed out to you. I contacted them via email and got replacements in a few days. The little Woden dolls are too little in my opinion. The Barbie size dolls fit better but still aren't perfect for some of the furniture. The only thing not perfect is the elevator. It's a bit tight like the others have mentioned but I used Vaseline when installing and that helped a lot. I believe it will loosen up with use which is probably why they made it tight to begin with.<br /><br />I must admit that I've played with this house everyday for a week until I had to wrap it.

605,5.0,Amazing dollhouse-but VERY large!,"We ordered this dollhouse for our three year old daughter. I spent hours online trying to find the best dollhouse within a reasonable price range and I also shopped around in a few stores. I do think this one is the best choice! It definitely has the best reviews. As most of the reviews say, it does take some time to put together, so set aside a couple nights to work on it or whenever you have time. It is very sturdy and well made. Our daughter loves it and I think she will have a lot of fun in the years to come. There are two things I'm not completely happy with: 1. The size of the house. I knew it was big, that was actually a lot of the reason I decided on this one, but it's hard to visualize how big it actually is until u see it in person. It could possibly be overwhelming to some children. Also make sure you have enough space for it! 2. The elevator does not work. We had to cut off part of it so it would slide up properly. I also added Crisco to the metal part which did WONDERS! It works perfectly now, but I do feel they need to work on the manufacturing of the elevator so that it doesn't have to be tinkered with just so it will work.<br /><br />Overall, this dollhouse is great! I do recommend buying it if you have the space for it.<br /><br />Oh I also want to mention that I LOVE the furniture that comes with it!<br /><br />Has anyone bought dolls for it?

623,4.0,It's great but don't expect to assemble on Christmas eve!,"Overall, this was a good purchase for $145. It's huge. Once assembled it is quite sturdy but not super heavy, which is good. The instructions were easy to follow, but heads up that this will take HOURS to complete. I read in other reviews not to assemble on Christmas Eve so my husband and I assembled half on the 22nd, and the other half on the 23rd. Both of us working together took about 3-3.5 hours to assemble. It was 28 steps if I remember correctly! So if you are putting it together alone then expect 4+ hours! There were also a couple instances where holes did not line up exactly and hubby had to use some muscle to get it together correctly.<br />Last minor gripe (but isn't really important) is that there are screws of different colors, but share the same name in the instructions. So it will say to use hardware labeled ""L"" and then when you go for the L hardware you have to decide whether to use the white, blue, gray, brown or silver ones. So not a huge deal, but if you want the colors to match appropriately then you will have to put a little forethought into it. (Instructions are in black and white and do not mention colors at all)<br /><br />So it seems I have listed multiple reasons to dislike this product but really I am actually quite happy with it.

722,5.0,My kids will love it!,"I bought this doll house for my daughter for Christmas and just finished putting it together. From the reviews it sounded like it took awhile and I wanted to get ahead of the curve and make sure no parts were missing well before Christmas. The doll house is very solid and well made, almost everything (furniture included) is made of sturdy wood that will withstand hours of play (and my kids are pretty enthusiastic players). Of the entire doll house, my only complaint is the stairs. While everything else is made of very sturdy compressed wood, the stairs are made up of cheap plastic. I'm still rating it 5 stars though because my kids will probably not care :) My daughter will love it!<br /><br />As for the assembly do not wait until the night before, you will thank yourself. The directions are the kind with only pictures and no words. For the most part they are OK, but I found myself putting several pieces on backwards due to the illustrations not specifying the direction. Also, there are several areas where you match up the color on the hex screw with the color of the wall on the house, but they don't tell you which color to use. I know it sounds like it would be obvious, but there are also several unfinished hex screws that are silver, so if you don't guess right then you might end up with an ugly silver screw where a colored one should be. Nothing that was a huge deal but it made the process a bit slower. Also I had to bend at an awkward angle to screw in some of the screws, but that is probably just normal for something of this magnitude. It went together fairly easily, but would be a lot better with a partner, I did it solo.<br /><br />One thing that I did really appreciate is proper alignment of the screw holes. I didn't have to try and force it to align or drill additional holes, which typically I have had to do with other put together items. That helped keep the frustration level down quite a bit.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEPOQFBUZJI5K4T2242MVHLCTDTA,1448295037000,1,True

Looks beautiful in room and everyone that sees it is immediately drawn to it .... and wants to play.  Beautiful and really such a bargain for all that you get.  Didn’t have trouble with elevator (installing or using afterward) but regret that it subtracts a chunk of space / obstructs items behind it when parked on a particular floor.

It is much more sturdy than the plastic dream house that they were claiming they wanted and it fits their dolls perfectly, so they do not mind that is isn’t that brand at all. My only complaint was that the instructions for assembly were pretty awful. I am generally pretty good at deciphering instructions, but I had to resort to YouTube videos to help with this.<br /><br />If you are purchasing this for younger children, you may consider purchasing a sturdy step stool for them to use. I am 4’11” and the roof reaches the bridge of my nose. Even with a step stool, my twins can still barely see the top floor.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great purchase!

744,5.0,The value of this dollhouse is just unreal!,"My wife and I are thoroughly impressed and satisfied with this dollhouse. It is amazing! It’s literally almost the size of me (5’ 8”) and I think that’s just hilarious. The value that you get with this is just unreal... I don’t know how they’re making money on this! The amount of items you get with the house along with the quality and size of the house itself... we’re just at a loss for words. Very impressed with it. The only things that they could improve on is the instructions. There were several times when I wasn’t sure how a piece was supposed to be facing or what color screw was supposed to go where. But that’s the other thing... the screws are colored for the different color parts of the house! It’s the attention to the smallest details like that that I’m talking about. You get so much value in this dollhouse. I ended up finding a couple on YouTube with a assembly video that I kinda looked at when I wasn’t sure about something and it really helped out a lot. All In all it took about 5 hours to assemble by myself, and it is so worth it. Again, the instructions could be more clear, like what way the pieces should be facing (labeling on the picture what color to which side), what color screw goes where.. those kinds of things. Maybe even an instructional video from the company themselves would be helpful as well. Or just search up some others like I did.

748,4.0,Assembly NIGHTMARE!!!!,"So, I would say I'm a furniture assembly hobbyist. I look through the IKEA catalog dreaming of cam and barrel nuts. What I'm trying to say that I've together a thing or two in my day.<br /><br />This may be the worst assembly of anything I've ever done. In all, this took me between 3-4 hours to assemble, which seems ridiculous for a dollhouse.<br /><br />There are two main issues with assembly<br />1) Poor quality control / tolerance on parts. There were several times where bolt holes were off by a few mm. I suspect many people may not have the strength or patience to force these pieces into place.<br />2) The directions... my God the directions. So here's the thing: all the pieces are two-sided. If you're assembling a book case, it's relatively easy to understand where to put the unfinished/finished edges. The issue here is that all sides are finished, but the instructions give NO indication of the orientation the piece should be. You find yourself flipping forward several pages to try and figure out what you're doing... ""oh... ok, in 90 minutes, this is going to be a bathroom, need to put the floor facing this way"". Absolute nightmare.<br />3) I came up with a third reason... there are some legitimately difficult parts of the assembly. Parts, where you're lying on your side so you can use your leg to push in on the side of the house while you use your other two hands to assemble.<br /><br />Another example: one of the last steps is screwing the door knobs on. OMG. So, the door knobs are like 1/2"" wooden balls, predrilled to accept a screw. How any mortal in the world can hold that ball while trying to drill into it is beyond me. After failing (and stripping the first screw) I had to get a C-Clamp out.<br /><br />4) Oh oh, and a fourth reason! So, the included hardware is nicely split into individual groups. So, there is a ""I"" screw. The issue is that some of the bolts/hardware are actually colored. But, because step 3 says to use 3 bolts, you'll use all the bolts from the little pocket that has 3 bolts, right? WRONG. You should have used 1 bolt from three different pockets so it could be color matched to the piece it was holding... you'll understand.<br /><br />Once it's assembled it's an awesome dollhouse. It's like legit. Comes with a PIANO!! (wooden and unplayable of course). It's huge; it's sturdy; there's an ELEVATOR!! Your kids will love it.

767,5.0,Amazing house! Great quality and overall build,"I have to tell you, I was skeptical about a house at this price at this size. I figured it would be a decent piece that wouldn't last through the year.<br />I have a 2yo and 4yo, I have put enough toys together and tried to follow unclear instructions and left out a screwed or had to undo a part to redo it correctly. Not the case with this one. The parts were all clearly labeled and easy to follow along, other than step 5 and 6. Ibhad a little trouble figuring out the overlap of pieces.<br />The entire assembly took about an hour and a half, with some interruptions and trying to redirect curious little munchkins.<br />There were a couple of parts that were damaged, police included. Weird party was they were parts that were nestled inside other parts, none of the parts close to the box were actually damaged.<br />I called the 800 number, spoke to Scott, who was awesome. Just make sure you have the item number, batch number and part numbers ready so they can help you out. Sending out the parts, nohassle or hoops to jump through. Great customer service at KidKraft! I would definitely buy another one of their products.<br />Only area of improvement I would say is the clock and the chandelier.

780,5.0,Huge house,Ok so I took so many photos for future buyers. This product was amazing after all of the hard work. It wasn't super bad to put together but I'm also a person who likes to build things so if you aren't your in a rude Awakening.<br />So the instructions were great but need to be in color so it is more clear as to the direction each piece needs to face and the roof need arrows or something to be placed properly. I was t expecting for the house to be so tall so I took a photo with it to show the true size. I am 5'2 as you can see so the house is huge. But totally worth the buy.<br />I can t wait to unveil it for my daughter on Xmas. The screws and everything were I'm order with the instructions so if your patient and take your time with it it comes out perfect. I say do t screw so tightly tho I thought I was going to split a few pieces and break the house while building it.<br />Also they do need to adjust the cut outs some pieces o had to struggle to fit properly. They weren't totally accurate in the measurements I had to push and pull pieces to fit so the screw would fit in both holes to begin screwing the screw Into it.<br />All that aside it's a great gift. I would buy it again to be honest I love it and it's better than. Amy other doll house. Like I know it's a huge house. It size wise it's perfect. They should aim for an upgraded version to 2020 status but keep the same size they have created now.<br />Other than that I give it a great review.<br />Just be patient putti g it together a d be sure to screen shot a pic of the displayed house to refer back to as you build with the given instructions. That's what I did other wise I would have messed the house all the way up lol.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71itigQ36wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71itigQ36wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71itigQ36wL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813kBi-zcIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813kBi-zcIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813kBi-zcIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81T7exbSwbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81T7exbSwbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81T7exbSwbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XD8R4TqQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XD8R4TqQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XD8R4TqQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c5bGLrkJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c5bGLrkJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c5bGLrkJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fwd9ufWmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fwd9ufWmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fwd9ufWmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81n6j78J+IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81n6j78J+IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81n6j78J+IL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x7ibKk4kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x7ibKk4kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x7ibKk4kL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFIHLCW665BZDO5CDMGKVEOU2FMQ,1577167542296,22,True

The directions are very basic and I was left figuring things out on my own. Due to this, I feel I messed up on some of the structures like the elevator. After 3-4 hours it was done and yes it looks great. It's very tall and my three year old has to stand on a stool to play with the very top room.  The garage does not hold barbie cars.  The structure is to small for a barbie car or jeep. The wood furniture that comes with it is very impressive.

785,5.0,"Great value, sturdy and beautiful","We bought this for my 2.5 year old who immediately fell in love with it Christmas morning. She’s too short to see the top floor—and she’s tall for her age—but we will use it to store stuffed animals until she can access it. We purchased this instead of the Barbie Dream House because with this you get a LOT more house for less money (we bought it while it was on sale for $93!) and it seems sturdier.<br />My husband put it together by himself in about 3 hours with a few breaks. He said the instructions were fine. He did not use a drill.<br />The bed and piano needed assembly but otherwise all furniture came put together. One piece, a small table, was broken. It was easy enough to glue the leg back on though (most furniture appears to be assembled using glue).<br />Barbies will fit in this house but the Barbie Glam Convertible does not. It’s a few inches too long and the garage doors won’t close. It doesn’t bother my daughter though!<br />The elevator is a bit difficult even for myself to easily operate but I’m hoping with some wearing-in it will glide more smoothly up the track.<br />My one issue is the bottom floor of this house could stand to be a bit deeper than the other floors, and stick out a few inches at the bottom. This would provide some stability; as it is, the house MUST be secured to a wall or it is in danger of tipping over if your child likes to climb.<br />All in all, excellent value for money and looks like it will last for years to come.

796,5.0,"Great value, sturdy craftsmanship.... best dollhouse!","Great doll house. HUGE! 4FT BY 4FT. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ROOM. Daughter needs stool for top floor. Very sturdy and good quality craftsmanship. All wood product, only plastic was the steps and some of the furniture pieces had plastic on them. Although some furniture had plastic, most the furniture is wood pieces and have fine details.<br /><br />Assembly took an evening ,but maybe would have been 3 hrs if I wasn't stopping to do other things in between. All wood so be comfortable with screw driver, Allen wrench and cordless screw driver. Cordless screw driver is a necessity as holes dont conform to all screw sizes. Pre drilled but holes a little smaller than screw thread, so save your hands and use a cordless driver. Instructions were in black and white and detailed. All pieces numbered and screws come categorized in letters. Could have used more written instructions as sometimes it got confusing with so many pieces and screws happening.  For the most part, each step of instructions were limited to minimal tasks which made it easy to follow. Also I used a picture from Amazon page of the house put together to get more assistance with making sure right pieces are being placed in the right direction or correct piece. Instructions would be better if it showed the pictures of had detail to ensure you were putting the piece correctly.<br /><br />Pay attention to colored screws as they need to be used with same color background colors. All of them come mixed so it can be a challenge to find the right color.<br /><br />Some pointers I learned. Don't tighten all the screws until you have done the next step. With predrilled holes you need a little wiggle room to align the next piece.  If tightened if makes it hard to adjust next holes.<br /><br />Also, holes for screw ""I"" are smaller than thread, very hard to get started. I found using power drill with Phillip's head directly on the hole and spinning it widened it enough for the thread to enter easier.<br /><br />I did this on my own, but having a helping hand to help make sure pieces dont move. Need help to move the final product due to size.<br /><br />Overall 4 yr old approved and worth 160 I bought it for. Fits her regular sized 11inch dolls. She does need a stool to see the top floor.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />P","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-V0U7x4pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-V0U7x4pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-V0U7x4pL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711q0UHmGNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711q0UHmGNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711q0UHmGNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713p6YFadTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713p6YFadTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713p6YFadTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715YyHVGvPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715YyHVGvPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715YyHVGvPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715k+XSJMfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715k+XSJMfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715k+XSJMfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EyK4sRKSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EyK4sRKSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EyK4sRKSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kNVZVVPNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kNVZVVPNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kNVZVVPNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AG5HH5XOQLXECGPAF52G3OPRTUXA,1598847130524,0,True

811,5.0,Very quality!,"If you are thinking about buying this product, don't think anymore and just buy it. I have twin four year old daughters and they got this as a birthday gift back in March of this year. Daily (literally daily) they probably play with this for several hours and could not love it anymore. The house is the prefect size for barbie dolls/other similar sized dolls.<br /><br />For the price point, this house is a steal. Knowing the quality of it, I would have paid more for it back then. Assembly is rather easy, you just need to take your time and take a deep breathe, it will take a while, but the end product is stable, and strong. I have had no breaks, issues, loose screws, etc in the 4 - 5 months my daughters have had it so far.<br /><br />Note, even the furniture included with the house is super well built. Most of it is solid wood, and besides the legs on the piano falling off (easy to glue on) nothing has cracked, chipped, etc.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGENTQA62DQR3PE22NUXHZCPS5AQ,1474920863000,0,True

813,5.0,Worth it.,"We ordered this for the Santa gift for my girls (age 2.5 and 4.5) this year and it is wonderful...and HUGE!<br /><br />First off, it DOES take some time to build, and granted staying up til 2am on Christmas eve with a few glasses of wine does tend to hinder the construction a tad, it still took my husband 3+ hours to build. There are alot of pieces and one WILL need an image of the built house to reference... the directions do not tell you which side sometimes they want facing where, but none the less once figured out it was smooth, just long. It also helped to have the pieces laid out in number order before starting.<br /><br />Now, when people write saying its TALL, they are not joking, its TALL!! I am 5'8 and the roof hits the tops of my shoulders. The girls have to use a stool to reach the baby's room in the attic! We will be using some pet. jelly on the elevator to make it a bit smoother but I don't think it needs any more than that to loosen it up.<br /><br />The house itself, is very well made, classic looking, (so no fear of it becoming out dated anytime soon) and sturdy. Way BETTER than a Barbie brand house for more money and uses plastic for it's main posts. The furniture it comes with is bigger than the images give them credit for and they too are made of wood. Quality again.<br /><br />I def would say this is a GREAT BUY!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFURRXG5JDSYT43DIC43M4TLM2MQ,1388117262000,0,True

I found myself swapping out screws that I needed for other sections (and this is after reading other reviews).

830,5.0,Smooth as a baby bottom.,"I just ordered this for Christmas for my 5 and 6-year old girls.  What I found is that the price on Amazon fluctuates frequently.  Over a period of two weeks, I saw this listed as over $200 to the lowest of $99.  I picked it up at $129 plus free shipping.  I'm guessing this is a hot product for Christmas, and as the holiday draws closer, the price drops.  At $129, I feel like I got a steal, even though less than a week later it dropped another $30!  That said, it came in a large brown box and was delivered within a few days.  The box said what the item was but didn't have any photos on the outside.  Fortunately, I read many of the reviews on this site and was prepared beforehand with some lube for the elevator, some wood glue, a hand drill with phillips head bits, a regular hand phillips head, and alcohol.  I put this together alone, with a wide open work space, low stress (no kids around), and with a nice frothy beverage.  From the time I started cutting the box until the time I was done putting it together was right aorund four hours.  Anyone who says they did this in an hour and a half alone is a stone cold liar - yes I said it.  I'm a pefectionist, but it's just not possible for a first-timer.  If I'd put together a few of these, I could probably cut the time some, but I hardly think I could cut it in half.  With two people and one of those two being skilled, maybe two to three hours...maybe.  That said, I did not have a single hiccup in building this thing.  The directions have no words, but the pictures are very clear.  There were a total of 29 steps...by the time I hit step 5 I was glad I had beer on hand.  But it was not hard by any stretch, just time consuming.  I wish the pictures in the instruction manual had some color photos...this would have helped on one or two of the steps, but I just looked up pictures of the product on Amazon on my phone and that was good enough to guide me.  All the parts were clearly labeled and numbered with a little white sticker, which was really important to the ease of putting this together.  The screws were all separated in a little vaccuum pouch, and were even color coded.  Again, this was extremely important.  All of the holes in the wood were in the right places and all of the wood was cut to the right dimension.  When contructing the wing on the left, there was one piece that didn't match just perfect, but I made it work with little effort.  When I started, I wood glued the elevator pieces, but stopped gluing there.  By the time I had the whole thing put together, honestly I don't think it needs the wood glue.  This thing is very sturdy, it's huge, and it's beautiful.  I'm totally impressed with myself.  I knew I was awesome, but I'm now in awe of myself for selecting this product and putting it together all by myself.  I can not wait to see the look on my girls' faces come Christmas morning.  Kidkraft made an awesome product in this doll house.  I did purchase the Kidcraft Professional Doll Set as an accessory.  Biggest warning I have for a prospective buyer is this thing is huge!!  Like if it falls on a kid, you seriously have to worry about brain bleeds and hospital copays.  I plan to anchor this to the wall, which likely will take more beer to do.  I have to transport this from my mom's house to my house now, which will require keeping the main house split from the wing and using a pick-up truck bed.  I have to admit, when I first opened the box, there was an alcohol-fueled tirade of choice expletives echoing throughout my mom's home, but once I set my mind to it, it went smooth as a baby bottom.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHQCJ3AA55ZKPE6THMCDNT4U7TTA,1418949410000,11,True

844,5.0,Awesome dollhouse,"Gotta say that this blew me away when I saw it.  It was for my 4 year old daughter and I wanted something larger scale & not fussy.  Talk about large scale, she needs to use her stool to play with the top floor.  She will definitely be able to use this for years and her 7 year old brother likes it too.  It looks great in her room.<br />It took my husband several hours to get it put together so plan ahead.  It is just heavy enough to be substantial, but light enough that you can pick it up & move it when needed.  Pretty pastel colors & the furniture is awesome!  Chunky tables & chairs, chandelier, bed, crib, toilet, floor lamps, etc.  I wanted to get in there and start decorating.<br />They say that you can use 12"" fashion dolls (barbies I guess)but I wouldn't recommend it.  The celings are high enough but the furniture is not the right scale for dolls that tall.  We ordered the [[ASIN:B001LU6RL4 Doll Family of 7 Caucasian]] which were a bit smaller than the furniture but that works better I think.<br />The box arrived with a hole punched in it and we found one of the main panels had been damaged but we called KidKraft and they shipped us a replacement piece free of charge within days.  Word of advice:  don't wait until the last minute to unpack & put together in case you have a similar problem.  There are a lot of pieces densely packed in the box so look them all over well before you plan to present the toy.<br />In short:  Amazon shipped a well priced good quality product quickly.

847,4.0,Kids love it and that is what matters,It took a lot to get this doll house here! We had lots of issues but that's not what this review is about. The doll house is pretty good. One reviewer said it is flimsy until all the way put together and I'll agree with that. We took it up stairs and into my children's room without any issue or fear of it breaking. But the wall and ceiling decorations are a bit disappointing. The material is peeling off in places. The garage doors will not close. One over laps the other. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if it's just warped. A lot of the boards were warped. But what really matters is my daughters love it. They used their own money and sold another big toy in order to buy this doll house. So I'm glad they love it. I would -NEVER- pay full price for this but if you can get it on a good sale (we did) then I'd snatch it up.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+MPxDwG5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+MPxDwG5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+MPxDwG5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AECIAA2NH4GX2DSDLUF264U5RCLA,1419966847000,6,True

865,2.0,Would send it back if I could,"Pros- my daughter loves this set and it came with a lot of furniture. It looked great once it was put together and she plays with it every day (mostly on the bottom two floors of the house- she’s only 2 and this thing is tall!)<br /><br />Cons- there is already drooping on the third and fourth floors and we haven’t even had it for a month. My daughter has never played on the fourth floor as she can’t reach it and she barely ever plays on the third floor. The construction offers no support under the flooring at either end (see pics) so it wasn’t an issue with how we put together. Also, it took HOURS to put together and my husband is a very handy person.<br /><br />I would not purchase this brand again and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. For over $100, you’d think it would have more support where needed. If it wasn’t such a hassle to put together, I’d consider taking it apart and sending it back. Wish I had bought the one for $50 more from Costco.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7180fcpF8QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7180fcpF8QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7180fcpF8QL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AcQzvdrYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AcQzvdrYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AcQzvdrYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hbX+Yq-hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hbX+Yq-hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hbX+Yq-hL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qPgIifE1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qPgIifE1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qPgIifE1L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGT6Q53DJJCK6B4F7ORN7PWDEKUA,1578594999336,0,True

She has a step stool to see the top floor which she doesn’t mind.<br />ASSEMBLING:<br />I read other people’s reviews about assembling it prior to the day you plan on gifting it. I highly recommend doing that. I timed myself and it took me 3 hours and 23 minutes to put the entire thing together. The instructions are slightly hard to understand and it’s not in color so that makes it more difficult. However, it’s not impossible.<br /><br />I assembled it in my living room and then had to take it upstairs to my spare room to hide it since it was too big to hide in my closets. Surprisingly enough I was able to carry it by myself upstairs easily, in 2 pieces: The house and the garage separate. The boards are sturdy. There were 2 parts that took me a bit to fit together: 1. The roof doesn’t exactly line up but it’s not too noticeable<br />2. The garage walls didn’t line up with the holes exactly so it took a bit of finagling but you don’t really notice after it’s complete.<br />My daughter’s dolls are 11inches tall.

875,5.0,Great for the money,"We bought this for Christmas 2014; I kept meaning to write this review earlier.  I searched online for what seemed like hours for a sturdy but not astronomically priced dollhouse that the girls could move the furniture and dolls around in.  I can't remember all the reasons I finally chose this one but I'm glad I did.  Even though my oldest wanted a princess castle for Christmas, she (5yrs) and her sister (3 yrs) LOVED it on Christmas morning.  It is taller than they are so it was very magical for them to walk in the room and see it.  They play with it almost every day, and the furniture gets scattered among their other toys.  The piano legs started breaking off about 4 months after Christmas and a couple other pieces are now starting to break 6 months after Christmas.  The 1yr old also gets a hold of the furniture from time to time.<br /><br />Putting the dollhouse together was a challenge but not utter frustration that made me want to pull my hair out.  The instructions are pretty clear, every single piece is numbered.  I forgot to put the back panel on the top floor so I had to go back a couple steps and redo it but it wasn't that big a deal.  The three roof pieces didn't fit exactly correctly but I was able to force them a bit and no one seemed to notice (tall husband included).  There were a couple other picayune hangups--the doorknobs were too difficult to get in place because they just wanted to spin with the screwdriver and I didn't bother to use a clamp to hold the knob still.<br /><br />I would highly recommend starting this project a few days in advance; it took me a good 4 hours between having to finagle a way to hold pieces still while adding pieces (the three floors for example) and then just having butterfingers with the screws/ allen wrench.  It would also have been helpful if my husband could have helped me but since I waited until the last minute I had to do it while he was at work.  You also will need a large working space; I laid all the pieces out so I could see their numbers before starting to build and it filled up my app. 10x 15 living room.<br /><br />I've moved the house several times when rearranging and it is light enough for me to move it alone; it didn't act like it was about to fall apart.

He didn't have any issues and everything was laid out clearly in the directions. The color coding of the screws was very helpful!! Everything seems to be sturdy and well made. I'm glad that plastic came at a minimum in this dollhouse. The colors are very attractive and furniture well made.  As you can see from the picture, this house is huge! More than enough room for two maybe three to get in there and play. Even my older kids were enjoying this for a while. The girls are currently using Barbies for the house and the dolls fit well. The only real issue is that the dolls keep knocking the chandelier down when they &#34;walk&#34; by that room. My girls just remove it altogether. All in al this is a great gift!

I do believe our grand daughters will have a ball with it for years to come. The house actually went together well as you follow the instructions carefully. But one caution; don't overtighten those T-Dowel fasteners, snug is good. However, for $180.00, I would think that Kidcraft could engineer the the backwalls abit better so the wall to wall background detail would line up. The baseboard lines at the middle floor rear are about 3/4"" higher than the sides and the upper floor is off less than that. Not that the kids will notice or care if they did, but the Finisher notices these things as he's building it.

The furniture and accessories that came with it are also well built and should last for years with normal use by children. I am really looking forward to giving this to my granddaughter for her seventh birthday in a few weeks.<br /><br />This thing is huge. I completed the main part of the house and then the “side part” (the part has the garage). The garage is fully assembled and then attached to the side of the house. If you plan to deliver this house (and have a car) then I recommend that you wait until you get it to its destination prior to attaching the side. Even keeping it in two pieces I may have trouble getting it into my car. Like I said, this thing is huge!<br /><br />I gave this a three-star rating simply because of the assemble instructions. Every piece has a small sticker with a number on it. This makes it easy to identify which piece is which. But BY FAR this had the worst instructions I have ever encountered. Example; many of the panels are two-sided. The instructions show a blank white image with the number on it. You have to figure out which side goes in which direction. I did find a video on YouTube that offered some help. The manufacturer's website has no video and the instructions shown there are basically the same as what came in the box. Many of the screws have colored heads to help them blend in. But, the instructions do not mention this, you have to figure it out on your own or have a bunch of different colored heads showing.

However, there were many more than I expected, and during the 2 hour process of putting together the house, they began to really stand out. We have at least 3 major pieces (floors and decorative walls that have either folds or scratches in the top layer. They are fairly noticable even when the whole house was put together. We also have 3-4 corners that we will need to glue the top layer back to the backing. We experienced some smaller issues like holes not lining up, but they were much easier to overcome, and not visible once we completed the house.<br /><br />I am disappointed to have so many major &#34;imperfections&#34; when we first received the dollhouse. I do realize that my daughter will cause such imperfections over time, but we were looking for a good quality dollhouse that will grow with her. We did expect the quality to be a bit better from the onset.<br /><br />However, overall I am pleased with the dollhouse, the size is just as stated, perfect for a little girl to grow with.

They love the size and it's perfect for the barbies.<br /><br />It took me a total of 6 man hrs to build it so be prepared. The main trouble was the elevator. It was easy to build, the problem is that the small plastic track and small bearings fix together too tightly. I could barely move it so I knew my girls wouldn't be able to. I actually had to &#34;grind&#34; out some of the track in order for elevator to move. After that, before I assembled the entire elevator, I ran the bearings in the track a good 50 times to wear them in. They are cheap bearings so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Outside of the elevator issues the rest of the house went together smoothly. I has held up the my 3 girls so far. It's seems pretty sturdy for press board. The instructions were easy to follow and it even came with extra hardware.<br /><br />Smart buy!

975,4.0,Everything a little girl dreams of,"This dollhouse is worth every penny! Comparing it against the Barbie houses and other dollhouses on the market, it offered the best price to feature/quality ratio I could find. I bought this dollhouse for my twin girl's 5th birthday and we were not disappointed what so ever.<br /><br />This house is everything your little girl would expect: Durable, lots of wooden furniture, an elevator, lots of space for barbies and hours worth of enjoyable imagination everyday.<br /><br />For the parents, this dollhouse comes packed in a thick shipping box, with Styrofoam inserts to prevent damage to the parts, easy to follow instructions with numbered pieces, a descent manual, basic tools, earthquake/tipping prevention straps, and a number to call with questions or for parts replacement printed in the manual. I recommend you have at least a good amount of space to build it, wood glue, quality Phillips screwdriver (not power as you can strip the holes or crack parts easily) and a good Allan wrench with some leverage on it to tighten things appropriately.<br /><br />Building the dollhouse:<br />The dollhouse took me, a novice wood worker, a total of 4 hours and 29 minutes to build (Yes, I timed it). It may have been built quicker, but I used a lot of Elmer's E742 Waterproof Wood Glue to ensure things wouldn't fall apart or break (I highly recommend using wood glue on the non-MDF joints).  As stated, each part is numbered with a sticker to help build the dollhouse, but the picture on the front of the shipping box was an invaluable aide in trying to determine the orientation of each MDF printed, Pine, or plastic piece. The hardest parts to build were the roof (don't screw everything down until you can align it correctly) and the garage/patio left side (lots of pine pieces).<br /><br />The good:<br />- A very well made/durable and long lasting house with furniture<br />- Sturdy floors, roof and elevator parts<br />- Lots of printed detail on the MDF walls and floors<br />- Guaranteed to not disappoint your little girl(s)<br />- In case a part breaks within 90 days, KidKraft will replace it for free and without shipping charges<br />- Great customer support (M-F 8:30-5, Central Time)<br /><br />The bad:<br />- The stairs do not stay in very well, is made of thin white plastic and will probably be the first to break for my kids<br />- The Elevator is stiff to operate, but works nicely if you put some dishwasher soap or petroleum based lubricant inside the rails<br />- The garage does not fit many of the barbie cars correctly as it is not deep enough to both put it in and shut the doors<br />- The chandelier comes off easily due to it being affixed with string around a piece of wood (I glued it in place instead)<br />- It wasn't free :P<br /><br />Regardless of the downsides of this dollhouse as every product has them, my family is completely satisfied with this product and I completely recommend this dollhouse to anyone who wants something that will last for years.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AF4QHUPCWSMPF7B6MS7J73J6E2EQ,1302903923000,42,True

979,4.0,Large dollhouse should get lots of use,If you’ve ever put a kidkraft item together you know to clear your schedule. It took me a while just to pull the pieces out of the box. Start to finish it took my 3 hours to complete. A few pieces had the patterned paper coming off and the holes that secured the stairs weren’t drilled in the right places so I used 2 long screws to secure it. I’m not sure if I am missing the handles for the garage but I didn’t see them right away so I used some spares I had from another project.

Really wish the directions had words with it for more detail!<br /><br />The bedroom is a little small for the bed.<br /><br />And lastly, one of the walls in the back is just a mm too small.  The way the frame fit together made a hairline space.  If that wall gets bumped too hard, we're going to be trying to get it back in there.<br /><br />Took about six hours to assemble, but we were juggling kids and trying to figure out which color coded bolt/screw that's the same size as another color coded bolt/screw went where.

Compared to the plastic Barbie houses that are almost the same price this is a pretty sturdy house and you get much more for your money! It is huge, I would recommend reading the measurements to make sure you have room for it before purchasing it. I am 5""5"" and it comes up to my chin. It does take a while to put together (3 hours for my husband) and the instructions could have been done a little better but other than that there is nothing to complain about. A few people reviewed about the elevator being stiff but we have had no problems with that either!

The alignment is off as you can see from my provided pictures. And one picture showing the wood...correction cardboard cracking when my husband put it together.

1017,2.0,Expected better quality for the price,"This was a Christmas gift for my two daughters (2 and 4 years old). It was easy to build. However for the price I was expecting the house to be made of a more sturdy material. The hard foam that it's made of is easy to chip. The paper that covers the garage doors are already peeling away from them being opened and shut. The elevator is impossible to move. My girls don't even play with that anymore because it's so hard for them to move up and down. The bar that attaches the elevator to the house is flimsy and doesn't attach well enough to the house for the elevator to glide smoothly. For the price I expected a better quality house. I expected it to be played with and the doors not show peeling paper. I expected the house to be made of a stronger material than foam. If this had not arrived later than expected, we would've found a better house from Santa. Do my girls love it? Yes, but as the person who spent their money on this, I'm disappointed in it.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHTH7DLGX5CA5LRU66D37DB2FKCA,1453137798000,3,True

1019,5.0,Super Awesome! A huge step up from the all plastic Barbie brand Dreamhouse.,"Long story short, my wife first purchased an actual Barbie Dreamhouse from a big box store. The elevator did not work, and the amount of plastic really put me off. Back it went, and I ordered the Majestic off Amazon. Simply picking up the shipping box made me feel better about this purchase over the Barbie brand as the weight of the entire set was significantly more than the Dreamhouse. But, is heavier better? After putting the house together I have to say an unequivocal &#34;Yes!&#34;.<br /><br />There are only a few plastic parts here which are the stairs, the elevator slide mechanism, the chandelier, the clock base, the tub and the toilet. The rest is wood and pressed cardboard similar to what's in the bottom of spec-built home kitchen drawers. Once together this house is very sturdy and a two-person lift to move it any significant distance. Again, I feel so much better about my daughter playing with this wooden house over the all plastic one even if Barbie herself is all plastic!<br /><br />Putting it together was relatively easy using the included instructions , labeled screws and marked pieces. Assembly was right around 2 1/2 hours going at a meticulous pace. I should add that two pre-drilled screw holes for the roof did not line up with the holes on the structure, and I had to drill new holes. A minor annoyance at best. The most difficult part for me was putting the back walls in place prior to screwing the second side of the house together. Keeping the walls in place and lining up the walls and floors took patience.<br /><br />The details on the walls, floor and roof are stickers/laminated and I imagine that over time they will show some ware. The furniture is very sturdy and unless abused will not come apart as some have stated. Perhaps mine were simply glued better? The small touches in detail on the included furniture was a nice surprise.<br /><br />Other reviews stating the floors warped have me thinking that water or some liquid had to be dumped on them for this to occur, or the humidity levels in the actual home are significantly higher than they should be. The floors and walls are as sturdy as one could expect at this price point. I can't imagine them not holding up fine with normal play.<br /><br />My daughter has not seen it yet as I put it together at night while she was sleeping. I'll update this after she has spent some time playing with it.<br /><br />All in all I really feel good about this purchase given the look and build-quality of the house.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGXWD4ENQI5TNULYRCHIDS2WEISA,1445404403000,8,True

1088,5.0,Great doll house for my toddler but has some bowing going on :/,"I have to start off by saying I do love this doll house! Comes with a lot for the price I paid. It’s beautiful and my daughter loves it! I bought if a few months in advance for Christmas. I put it on together and it’s been in a closet in the guest room for two months. I don’t know what happened or how it happened, but the 3rd floor is bowing. I’m kind of really upset about it but my husband said we can fix it with a small piece of wood, some wood glue and a small screw on both ends. I mean no one has touched it since it’s being in the closet. My 2 1/2 year old can open the door to the room nor the closet doors. I just don’t understand why it started bowing or when. I’m hoping this hasn’t happened to anyone else. I’m trying to think positive thoughts about us fixing it. I just hope it lasts a few years now :( but other than that it’s a great doll house.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712SUJcf9dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712SUJcf9dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712SUJcf9dL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714Hu1H7dgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714Hu1H7dgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714Hu1H7dgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Vah9d4eBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Vah9d4eBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Vah9d4eBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEVZKIDSYTF72VV2EZLVRJTYNBCQ,1672078226367,2,True

1122,5.0,they were a bit disappointed that Santa delivered this unassembled,"*This review may be edited at a later date by my husband as he is the one who put it together.<br />This was a gift from Santa for my 2 year old and 5 year old daughters to share. While they were VERY excited to receive a dollhouse from Santa, they were a bit disappointed that Santa delivered this unassembled. Apparently the elves now have something in their unionized contract which gets them out of assemblage on this unit. Santa apparently made an attempt to assemble it in the middle of the night but was unable to complete his project. He left a note by the stockings that there was a dollhouse waiting to be assembled for them in their daddy's workshop. So my husband being of good sport assembled it on December 26th. It was an all day project. And I do mean ALL day. He is handy, builds things and invents things on his own. So he is not an amateur. There were a couple of holes which needed drilling so the screws would insert properly. Also, the directions which came with it were poorly done and there was not a picture of what the finished product was supposed to look like. Thankfully, Amazon carries almost EVERYTHING. So even though this was a gift from Santa, we were able to see what we were assembling. Between figuring out the instructions, drilling some holes, changing out screws so that they were color coordinated and being under the close supervision of a 5 year old who has a tendency to micro-manage, it was an all day project. He did take a couple of breaks (coffee, food, watching Dumbo, etc...). But he started around 11am and was finished at 7:43pm. I suppose if one hadn't stopped to watch Dumbo, eat or drink and if the supervisor wasn't quite as 'present,' it would shave off a few hours. My guess is given the 'right conditions,' if you are a perfectionist, you should allow 5 hours for this.<br /><br />NOW, that is the negative part. The positive thing is this. IT IS ASSEMBLED!! And the girls LOVE it! Truly. It is a little girl's dream dollhouse. It is HUGE first of all. That in itself is magical. They love the furniture and rearranging it. They can easily play with their play figures and 12-14 inch sized dolls in it. And they love the garage. Their only 'complaint' was that it didn't have a pool. But that is easily solved by getting a barbie type pool and placing it on the side.<br /><br />All-in-all, I would recommend this. It will provide years of joy!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGIDC3TKDFYUUS6AYM66ZXOJOPFQ,1482863602000,11,True

We did however take around an hour with this one but the instructions were very clear and the parts were exceptionally labeled. Even had a ton of extras in the event that you lost a couple along the way. 80% of it is solid wood the other is paperboard and plastic...you just don't see that kind of quality nowadays with toys. My kiddos are rough and in the last month or so since we've had it...it's definitely takin' a lickin' to say the least but still looks brand new...the other one...eh, not so much.

I can't say that it is the highest quality or easiest to put together (about 3hrs work) but it is pretty good and should last a while.  When you put it together pay attention to the bolt colors.  They all have the same number but some are painted to match the background but nothing in the instructions tells you that and since they're all the same part number you assume they're all the same.  This can cause you some back-tracking if you're not aware of this and you want to make it perfect.  Also have some glue on hand, the bathroom wall on the 3rd floor has a tendency to come out, some of the paper comes loose from the wood so you'll want to glue that back, and one piece of furniture needed to be glued back together.

1142,3.0,"Major warping, particularly 4th floor.","I bought this last minute because Costco’s dollhouse was sold out. I’ve ordered Kidkraft items before and those items were great. This dollhouse isn’t terrible—it’s got a lot of accessories That come with it. It’s large. Fits barbies. (Not a car though). Fun rooms and areas inside. My daughter loves it.<br /><br />The assembly took a long time. I don’t recall how long. None of the pieces were cracked or damaged but there were a few spots where the design was peeling away from the boards. My biggest issue as to why I am between rating this a 2-3 is the warping. I don’t know how long the house will last and at what point the warping will start effecting playtime.  The warping began small and I figured it’s not too bad—not enough to go through effort of disassembling and returning. But it got a lot worse very quickly. I looked at other reviews after the fact and saw that others had mentioned this defect. I also noticed it in some review photos that didn’t mention it. It really seems to be a gamble as to whether it will warp. Construction was not done improperly to merit any sort of warping. Pieces aligned with premade holes and as laid out in instructions. It makes me sad because as I mentioned, my daughter enjoys it for now (the majority of the warping is an area that she doesn’t play in) and I’ve had good experiences before with kidkraft. Unfortunately, this one was not one of them.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41I7c3ki+GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41I7c3ki+GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41I7c3ki+GL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ScGBAk-AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ScGBAk-AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ScGBAk-AL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Soqe8pR2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Soqe8pR2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Soqe8pR2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Tqqcy+xtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Tqqcy+xtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Tqqcy+xtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aZ6cIXEXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aZ6cIXEXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41aZ6cIXEXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41lHSAnL38L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41lHSAnL38L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41lHSAnL38L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5194WiF9-aL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5194WiF9-aL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5194WiF9-aL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GzD13IpwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GzD13IpwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GzD13IpwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xhuU9-w0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xhuU9-w0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xhuU9-w0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AH5CSSLVKHOWKWYQ3K3NQUPRE3MA,1583798300481,0,True

1202,5.0,Best Christmas gift ever!,"This doll house is everything and more. I had made this order for my 4 year-old grand dauhter's Christmas present. When it hadn't come on the time expected, I contacted Amazon. I was told that the item had been sent back to seller, due to some previous imperfections from other recipients. I was refunded my money, but devastated that I had very little time to find another in it's place. Even Prime was too late for when I needed it. I went to a local toy store and purchased another Kid Kraft dollhouse that was more than double the cost, and much smaller. I had to settle for something much more expensive, and much smaller. We put the new dollhouse together and the next day I had the original one delivered from Amazon. I was so upset, because I couldn't return the one already assembled and without its box. Now, I have the original at my doorstep, and my card was already credited the money. We didn't need 2 dollhouses and I couldn't afford to purchase the original after spending $287.00 on the replacement. I contacted Amazon and explained my situation. Somehow, there was a mix-up and the company sent out my order, even after they told me it was returned. Amazon was so great in handling this matter. I was offered a buy-back of the product I purchased as a replacement, but what I paid was far more than Amazon's price so it wouldn't work. The nice man placed me on hold and returned to say, &#34;Merry Christmas! From Amazon&#34;. He said to keep the dollhouse at no cost. That night, we put the dollhouse up and it was as amazing as the picture. It is HUGE! It was easy to assemble, probably because we had some experience from the other. It was perfect in every way. It's very sturdy and heavy. My conscience wouldn't allow me to sell the replacement, being how Amazon was so kind by letting us keep the original for free. We found a little girl that was not going to have Santa Clause and gave it to her. This little girl was so proud, and so were we. Everyone was a winner here, but Amazon, you are truly the best!

The Dollhouse arrived well packed and damage free.  If you are an Ikea ninja, and are accustomed to putting furniture together with those little cam-lock bolts and wood screws you'll need a solid 90 minutes to put it together.  If you are not, God help you.  The instructions have no words...just pictures and numbers...and while the illustrations are clearly drawn, it isn't always clear which side goes where....if that makes any sense...you'll see.  My wife and I put it together only having to disassemble one piece that we did backwards.<br />Beyond the general huge-ness, you'll appreciate the quality of construction.  For the money, they did a really nice job.  Everything fits, and nothing felt cheap.  There is a box of furnishings for the house, including items like a grandfather clock, a piano, chaise lounge, beds, even a plant!  I think there are 35 pieces.  These pieces are constructed of wood and remind me of Melissa and Doug stuff scaled up to the Barbie range of sizes.<br />Here is my only known mistake with this thing...DO NOT DUPLICATE MY MISTAKE!  I did not buy the doll family pack sold by KidCraft for this house!!  So...my girls are playing with furniture and existing off scale dolls while the 'Family' makes its way to our home!

1235,3.0,Kid loves it. Mom not happy about buckling floors.,"Purchased this dollhouse last December as a Christmas gift for my 8yr old. She initially wanted a Barbie Dreamhouse but I just could not see paying over $180 for plastic or for such a small house. After researching and reading so many positive reviews for this house, I thought it'd be perfect. I like the amount of furniture that comes with it and the overall size. I paid a little more than $125 at the time and felt it was a great value.<br /><br />The assembly (which I did on 12/27) was not fun, especially since I put it together by myself. Thankfully, no pieces were missing and nothing was broken so I was fortunate not having to deal with that. I would highly recommend having another person to help assemble the house to preserve some of your sanity. I lost track of how long it took to assemble, but it certainly took me more than 3 hours 😵.<br /><br />Only one of the legs on the piano is curved, but since that doesn't cause it to lean, my daughter is fine with it. All the other furniture pieces are perfect and holding up well. Though I can't say exactly when it first occurred, what I've noticed and am unhappy about, is that the 1st (dining room & kitchen), 3rd (bedroom & bathroom) and 4th (nursery) floors have begun to buckle/dip in the corners.  Any furniture placed near the elevator on the 3rd fl has a noticeable slant. My daughter has 2 flat footed Barbie dolls that can stand up on their own when positioned just right. This can't happen in that area of the house because the dolls will topple over. The furniture isn't heavy, so that's not causing the bending. Nor are the corners areas of the house where my daughter spends most of her time near when playing. I've attached a couple pictures to show what I'm referring to.<br /><br />Apparently, the material used isn't as sturdy as it seems. What's frustrating is that I can't see a way to place something underneath to help push the floors up without obstructing movement around the house and/or causing the floors to bend further. For the amount of money I paid, and what I see is being charged now for the house, this is disappointing. Giving three stars because my daughter loves the dollhouse and plays with it just about every day, and I've had no other issues (yet) despite these flaws. More time will tell.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617rIZxwdFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617rIZxwdFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617rIZxwdFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TFJaSP1CL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TFJaSP1CL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TFJaSP1CL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qxTz7mhgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qxTz7mhgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61qxTz7mhgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+tJaetXTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+tJaetXTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+tJaetXTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d17fwNCqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d17fwNCqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d17fwNCqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHX5T26Y5VVTPJI3W7HMGSZ3XTIA,1543680756062,2,True

Its very durable, sturdy and seems very solid. It was so easy to build and didn't take me as long as i thought it was going to. 4hrs with breaks in between and no help. The accessories it came with were amazing and her barbie dolls fit perfectly. I did get the barbie beetle and that was too big to fit in the garage but no biggie we just parked it outside the garage like we in the real world do most of the time. Instruction weren't the greatest or clear but thanks to a youtube video i was able to differentiate the panels a lot easier than with the instruction book. I also purchased super thin string lights to add to the dollhouse and it turned out even better than without them. She loves her dollhouse and i have to say one of the best toy purchases i've made in a long time.

Thankfully that didn't happen!<br /><br />When I first took the pieces out of the box,  it was super overwhelming because there were like a thousand pieces 0_o but after organizing the pieces and laying them out, my panic attack quickly  went away.<br /><br />There were several moments in the assembly process where we weren't sure which way a certain board piece was supposed to face and what not, but I'm not not sure if I can blame the poor instruction guide or if it was just my own &quot;doy&quot; moments. Anyway, after two hours of crawling around on the floor, the house came together and I was stunned at how big it is! I want it for myself now!

1279,5.0,Full Five GOLD Stars,The doll house is truly fabulous. My daughters loved it a lot. It seems sturdy and of good quality that will last my daughters years to come. The instruction manual was straight forward most of the time. The numbering on all parts of the house made building a lot easier. All holes and notches were where they supposed to be. I didn’t need to drill new holes or force things around. You will know you’re following the instructions correctly if you don’t face issues like that. Building the house took aroud 3 hours but that is because I was building it with my kids. I think it will take 2 hours max maybe less If you are an expert at putting things together. You can build the house alone though having some help will make the process easier. The Furnature pieces were smooth and well made.

1280,5.0,Awesomely Large Fully Furnished Dollhouse,"This dollhouse, at 4½',  is huge and heavy, so you definitely want to assemble it in the space in which it is to remain. I gave it five stars because of its large 9 room size, weight, well-made furniture, and nicely decorated wall surfaces. Parents should take note, however, that its height and weight may pose risk of serious injury to a young child should little hands pull it down, so the most important step upon assembly for me was to secure it to a wall with the two included wall anchors.<br /><br />Assembly<br />Two allen hex key wrenches were included, which I supplemented with a medium Phillips head screwdriver and a mini snapoff utility knife.<br /><br />The first thing I did upon unpacking was to group the parts according to the numbers affixed to each.  This proved to be extremely helpful during assembly.<br /><br />The manufacturer, for some unfathomable reason, chose to forego written instructions for illustrated instructions. Not the easiest to understand, but doable. The parts illustrated, including the hardware, are numbered to correspond with the number affixed to each part. Additionally, some of the hardware is also color coded thereby further easing the assembly somewhat.  All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience, just one where I found myself occassionally frustrated by all the flipping of both the illustrations and the actual pieces to ensure the proper alignment prior to screwing pieces together. I also found the pictures of the house posted on Amazon to be extremely helpful during those times I found myself totally stumped.  I set aside four afternoons, spending about 7 hours in all on assembly.<br /><br />I also affixed a strand of battery operated mini led lights to the ceiling of each level to better illuminate the play areas. This proved to be a big hit with the grand who loves flipping on the switch each morning.<br /><br />Materials<br />The house is accented with solid wood framing on its front and thin strips of wood trim baseboard running along the rear of the floors.  The floors and walls are composed of some type of composite material. The floors are decorated to resemble hardwood flooring; the walls are decorated with appropriately themed furniture and fixtures.<br />The included furniture sets are a very nice bargain as similar wood sets run upwards of $30. Most of the furniture pieces are made of sturdy wood. The tub, toilet, and refrigerator door are plastic. The only small downside that I can see is that tips of the garage door paper finish lifted in the upper corners a tiny bit during assembly.  Not too surprised given that the boards are overlayed with glued decorative sheets of paper. A dot of gorilla glue took care of it.<br /><br />The house is divided into nine living spaces, including a bathroom, patio, and garage, and has a manually operated elevator. My grandchild absolutely loves this dollhouse and enjoys many hours rearranging the included furniture and moving her doll family throughtout the nine living spaces. It is an awesome dollhouse which will grow with her through the years. One of my best toy purchases ever!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHDKYB6RQKJA3W5B7RBGOF4WXDCQ,1578253988858,1,True

Its hard to get everything mixed up because they even have the screws colored and it tells you the colors (ie. the pink screw, green cross dowel etc.) it is very user friendly. Thats what I loved about it. The house itself is very sturdy. You dont need to buy anything for the house (besides the dolls). It has so many pieces of furniture and they are so big and very durable. I bought my daughter a Barbie car to go in the garage and its super cute. A few of the furniture have moving parts like the fridge and the sink. This went beyond my expectations and I've had the house in storage for 2 months waiting for Christmas and it was more than expected.

The furniture is just adorable. You will not have to purchase anything to go with it (other than dolls, if you don't have them).

1364,5.0,Amazing quality for the price,"This thing is fantastic! I was not expecting such a quality product for the price. The details are adorable. There's a chandelier (with a little wood block to hang from), circular wooden door handles for the garage doors, just super cute.<br /><br />It assembles easily as far as the actual putting together but the directions could use more detail. You're often guessing which way things face like with the floors and sides of the elevator. It's the first section you're assembling so you really have to look ahead and piece together how some of it goes together. It took us a long time to put together and I'm guessing we could have cut that down significantly if the directions were in color and showed all the holes on the pieces. For instance there are pieces that have a set of holes then another set 2 inches down but the directions only show the set of holes you're supposed to use for that step so again you have to look ahead and find where you use the other holes to use process of elimination. Not a deal breaker and totally worth the hassle for what you get in the end.<br /><br />I would have expected to pay significantly more for what I got, like close to double. I've bought several KidKraft items and have always been happy with my purchases.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AH6HFELBC4D5DPC5RTJ6QN3NM7XQ,1527902974914,0,True

1369,3.0,"A NIGHTMARE to put together, but lovely once done","This was the most frustrating thing I’ve ever assembled. I am good at following directions and usually have no problem putting things together. This dollhouse, was a nightmare. The directions are black and white pictures that do not tell you which side of each piece to use or which color screw to use. Worse, the holes were not aligned properly on several pieces. Some of the pieces weren’t even labeled. The roof gave me the most trouble. The holes were mid-drilled on one or more pieces and I had to literally, drill new holes.<br /><br />Once you manage to put it together, it is a nice, sturdy dollhouse that provides hours of endless fun.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: use a power drill. I don’t know how anyone could do this without one but the instructions just say to use a screw driver. Trust me, with all the poor drilling they did, you’ll want to have an electric tool for this!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AENTZG3TDLF6XTJDWBFDJ7O6NTJQ,1594488122544,0,True
1370,4.0,Highly Recommended!,"First off, this thing is big! Make sure you are paying attention to the dimensions (52.75&#34; H x 14&#34; D x 51&#34; W) and planning where this will go in your home. However, my 4 year old absolutely LOVES this doll house and has it FULL of dolls of all different sizes.<br /><br />Construction:<br />The instructions are well thought out and easy to follow. You will build this one section at a time (elevator, roof, garage, & main house) and combine these as the steps progress. I would suggest making sure you have plenty of room to spread things out and organize your pieces and set things aside after you build them until they are needed again, which was typically within the next few steps. The hardest parts in putting this together were #1) matching the color screws to the room color... just takes a bit of planning and #2) the slide in back pieces as they like to pop back out of place and I have one now that is not holding tight despite everything else being in very well. That loose panel is the only reason I have this a 4 vs a 5 star rating. Lastly, #3) the door knobs for the garage door are a bit of a pain to get on. Careful though when tightening these down as I did break off a screw inside of the knob and there are not any extras. I was able to find a suitable replacement from Hobby Lobby that looks nearly identical to the original.<br /><br />This was a Christmas gift so we constructed this in two phases. We built the main house and the garage separately in my in-laws basement and moved it home on Christmas Eve and attached the garage and roof. Overall construction time combined was about 2.5-3  hours but we were really in no rush to complete so it could probably go a little quicker. The main dollhouse took the entire back of my wife's Town & Country minivan with the third row folded flat to move so I don't see this fitting inside of a sedan, especially after being fully or even partially constructed so keep that in mind should you do as we did and store it elsewhere until Christmas.<br /><br />Quality:<br />This definitely seems to be made from quality materials and everything fits together very securely, with the exception of the above mentioned panel, but I do not see this falling apart or not being able to withstand a lot of play (I've attached an image of this thing in use). As you start putting this together it may feel a bit flimsy but rest-assured that once completed it is sturdy and you will, or at least should, love it!<br /><br />Shipping:<br />This thing is heavy! It is packaged well and surrounded by Styrofoam with the pieces stacked inside each other. Also, there is a huge picture of the dollhouse right on the box along with words telling you exactly what it is so hiding this can be a challenge if this is a gift.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely pleased with this. I am very thankful for the detailed instructions that helped my marriage survive yet another project. Should you decide to purchase this I believe you and your little one(s) will be very happy with it. I highly recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718BQkUCNSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718BQkUCNSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718BQkUCNSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718BQkUCNSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718BQkUCNSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718BQkUCNSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHFNPAEPCTF4E6XPRQOBD3N6FKJA,1483975626000,3,True
1371,2.0,Dubious Quality,"I purchased this dollhouse for my two year old daughter for Christmas. After two hours or so of assembly, I realized the main frame of the dollhouse was off, making it impossible for the back walls (which slide into the frame) to stay put. So lame considering 1) took a lot of work to put together; 2) there's no way to fix it; 3) most importantly, those back walls are where you screw the straps into the dollhouse to safely anchor it to the wall. Without those in place (and in really securely) this massive dollhouse is a HUGE safety hazard. Emailed customer service at KidKraft and it's been a mixed experience. On the one hand, they've been prompt in returning my inquiry and directing me to order replacement parts (free of charge). On the other hand, they never addressed why this might be happening (had to guess which replacement parts to order) and they never apologized or addressed the inconvenience of spending all that time assemblying a faulty product or the inconvenience I will soon experience in disassembling and re-assembling it to put in their replacement parts. Such a bummer--and never mind that anticlimactic moment when you give your daughter a really special Christmas gift only to have to pack it away until it can be fixed.<br /><br />The furniture seems well made and fun. It's pretty adorable. The actual housing structure quality seems dubious. The furnishings that are on the walls are stickers laid over cheap composite board. In some places, the sticker front is already peeling and it has had no use whatsoever. Honestly surprised this particular product is getting such good reviews.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFNVHL3ZLFRGZGQ5KZDWAAEGYJHA,1482958344000,4,True

I purchased  the same doll house new and had it sent to our second granddaughter who lives in another state after watching her fall in love with it on a visit in August.  I heard from her parents that it did take two and a half hours to put together last night but she was very excited when she saw it this morning.  It is a very well made product and very tall.  At 3 years old both girls could not reach the top level.  It takes up quite a bit of space so make sure you have room for it.  One of the best toy purchases that I have ever  made.

I told her that would be inconvenient for me and asked if I could just give her the info to get a replacement.  She said that she couldn't do that and I could only get help on the phone if I tried using a computer and the replacement part was out of stock.  I told her that was very annoying and that it was terrible customer service.  Here I am with 1000 parts to put together all over the floor with one broken part and now I need to go through multiple inconvenient steps to get the part replaced (and somehow keep all this hidden until Christmas).

My daughter is 4 and unable to reach the top level but I have caught her climbing it a few times to get to the nursery and thankfully nothing has broken and it hasn't tipped. The stairs tend to just come off super easy so when you put it together, GLUE THE STAIRS DOWN. Some of the furniture has broken in the past year as well, the piano legs come out very easy so I suggest you GLUE THEM IN PLACE before you lose them!!<br /><br />This was a pretty easy dollhouse to put together. My husband and I had it done in about an hour on christmas eve and she was beyond excited in the morning. Every person who has seen it has been very impressed and it holds it's value really well, I never see them on craigslist or ebay for under $100! How many kid's toys can you say that about!!<br /><br />If you are on the fence about buying this for your child- don't be. The price is perfect, cheap even for the quality you are getting.

I wouldn't say the quality of the parts are very high (some things don't fit flush, etc.) but nearly all the parts, including the furniture are wooden which gives it this classic feel. I am also surprised at the dimensions of this thing. Without the detachable garage this mansion is about 4 feet by 4 feet.<br /><br />Give yourself ample time to put this together.  From unpacking the box to casually putting each piece together it took about 2.5 hours to put together.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />Each piece is numbered 1-72 (more or less). If you have the space, lay them out in numerical order. The instructions will have you grab piece 5 and then 64 or something like that and having everything laid out in numerical order will greatly speed up the assembly of the product.<br /><br />The product contains several small wood screws to attach pieces together. Some of the screw heads are colored. Silly me didn't realize that the colors should match the color of the piece you are screwing that into until I was well into the assembly. For example, the blue roof should get the blue wood screws, etc. So keep that in mind. Don't just reach for any wood screw and use that to attach pieces.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, this product has A LOT of pieces and give yourself ample time to assemble. There will be moments where you will need someone to help you so have a helper close by. I took my time getting everything together and it took me about 2.5 hours. I would imagine it would take a more industrious/motivated person about an hour.<br /><br />Overall very happy with the product and now Barbie finally has a home :P",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHMFTXB3P4I4Q24LVEEPXRKTRETQ,1424051495000,1,True

Mostly made of solid wood, and barn door has steel hinges. This thing is huge, and my 4 year old granddaughter won't be able to reach the upper level but I got plenty of stepstools since she's a peanut anyway. Requires medium skills (someone who knows not to overtighten screws; I had to drill one missing hole but no biggie).

1500,1.0,Product Assembly Impossible due to Defect,"I ordered this product in November and held onto it since it was a present for my daughter... her main Christmas present (most of her other gifts were for this Doll House).  Due to it's size I had to take a risk and wait to assemble it on Christmas Eve because I had no-where to hide it.  Can you imagine my despair when I realized 5 holes were missing on one of the 42 structural pieces (part #8).  Part #8 is a KEY PART, the part that is a main sidewall and has the elevator attached to it.  The holes simply were not there.  Somehow they didn't get drilled.  I had to fabricate the thing together with screws and this made assembly a real pain and I ended up having to stay up until 1am putting it together.  I haven't contacted KidKraft yet since today is Christmas and they are closed but I will call tomorrow.  I will update this post with how the company makes this right or not.<br />I sure hope this didn't happen to anyone else.  How disappointing for some Mother or Father in the same situation as me but with no solution to fabricate it together... yuk!  Doll Houses are extremely important items for little girls, I'm thankful mine was not disappointed on Christmas morning.  My point?  Doll House assemblers and QA professionals should take their jobs very seriously because to the people who purchase them - they're extremely important!  - just sayin'.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Nsa-VjAvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Nsa-VjAvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Nsa-VjAvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGFHV4USCNKDEM6HNS2CBZLTTFBA,1356463785000,31,True

1504,4.0,Satisfied with my purchase.,"9/19/18. I'm a 59 YO grandma and I got this for my 2 granddaughters.  I have NO ""handyman"" experience, but I put this thing together by myself.  If I can do it, you can.  Was it easy?  No, but I took my time (about 7 hours over 2 days).  The instructions were NOT very helpful.  I had to pause frequently to take a look at the YouTube on-line video or just to look at the picture so that I would understand how things went.  Yes, I made mistakes, but I just backed out of what I did wrong and re-did it.  I am impressed with the sturdiness of this dollhouse and very impressed with all of the furniture/items that come with it.  Once I got things to fit together correctly, the thing is ""solid"" and I believe it will give my granddaughters a very long time to enjoy it.  Note:  from reading other's input, I did grease the elevator track with some Vaseline on a Q-tip.  However, I also used a little WD-40 directly on the screws that connect to the elevator compartment, and I DO NOT recommend that you do that because it can soak through the paneling and show up as an oily spot.  I learned the hard way on that.  I cannot stress enough to give yourself PLENTY of room to put this thing together.  Spread all of the pieces out and pay attention to what you have.  Most of all -- take your time and think about what you are doing and how it's supposed to look in the end.  If something doesn't look right, that probably means it is NOT right.  Would I buy this again?  Yes, definitely.  Also, from my point of view, Barbie-sized (12 inch) dolls are a bit too big for this house.... yes, they will ""work,"" but if you can find dolls that are more along the size of Barbie's little sister, Skipper (a couple of inches shorter), those work better.  Just sayin.  My youngest granddaughter is only 4 months old, but the older one is going on 4.  When she saw this dollhouse, she was so excited and happy, it made all the sore fingers and difficulties worth it!

1512,4.0,Great Product - Horrible to assemble,"My overall takeaway is that it seems like a great product but was horrible to assemble. It was obvious that the person that wrote the installation instructions had never actually assembled it themselves. So here are my takeaways:<br /><br />Great Product<br />Looks good in pictures; looks even better in person. Quality shows in the small details with the quality of the furniture which is really nice. And furniture is expensive for these things and sold separately could easily be $75-100 in of themselves. So if you can get this total thing for under $200 (and I got it for around $170), then it's a steal. Seems very sturdy and I'm not worried about my daughter breaking it. So from a safety perspective, seems great. Word of warning, it is tall so do make sure to use the enclosed attachments and attach it to the wall. Since it's so tall, kids may try to climb it and despite being heavy, I can see it toppling over if someone tries to climb it. And it's heavy enough to cause SERIOUS damage if it fell on your kid. Just attach it to the wall and then don't worry about it.<br /><br />HORRIBLE Installation<br />Like I said, obvious the person that put it together, had never put the product together. Honestly, the instructions were clearer in comparison to many products as far as the particular items that you should put together BUT they did a horrible job showing which sides to put the products. So for example, there were multiple times I attached something and then later in the process when I could better visualize how the product was supposed to work, I had to take it apart and switch something that was backwards or upside down. So definitely try to lay things out to visualize how it should go beforehand. Because it's not obvious how many of these should go. So be careful. Also, annoying things like making the packet that contains all the screws open on the back so every time you flip it over to find let's say the &#34;G&#34; screws, the &#34;D&#34; screws would fall out of the packet. Just the small details like this show that the company handed off the design to someone else to throw together the installation stuff and they didn't pay close attention to details.<br /><br />As far as putting it actually together, there were a couple holes that were slightly misaligned but you could force the screws through to take care of it. All in all, it took me probably 3.5 frustrating hours to get it together. Once you get the basic frame up though, it gets a lot easier. And just so you don't think it is just a lack of skill that made it difficult to put together, I've put together numerous furniture from Ikea, a crib, changing table, bookshelf, bedside table, and play kitchen all in my daughter's room. So I consider myself a bit of an expert. And this was worse than average to put together due to the ambiguous directions. Actually physically putting it together though wasn't that bad.<br /><br />Other takeaways:<br />REALLY Big - bigger than you realize. So definitely measure where you want to put it just to make sure there is room for it in your house.<br /><br />Customer service seems to be pretty good. The little clock furniture item was slightly warped and broken so it wouldn't stand up and I very easily ordered a free replacement online. Great website. Hopefully I should get the replacement in around 10 days.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGU6ORXD6I35O56OSK3YCW7X3XNA,1400768623000,2,True

If you want this item put together for a special day plan ahead. Ours took Dad and Uncle a couple hours to put together. It would have taken me a few days. I love the giant furniture but those &#34;floor lamps&#34; are like mallets on the head - keep away from 1 year olds.

Anyone who can read and use a screwdriver can assemble this in 3hrs or less. I did it in 3 with no help. Some of the holes didn't line up but I either forced it into place or pushed hard enough on the screwdriver to create fresh holes in the wood. Part of the staircase rail was cracked off but I put a dab of wood glue in it and you'd never know. Oh, and a hinge on the shed door was installed backwards at the factory, switched it around.

1536,4.0,Great product for the price. Watch out for garage assembly.,"My pictures don't do it justice since I had approximately 5 seconds to take a picture before she absolutely destroyed it. I wanted SO badly to give it 5 stars. I really did. Especially since the price is amazing for everything that came with it. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the garage. The rest of the house requires assembly. The garage is partially put together. In our case, the put together pieces made it that much harder to build. They were wood glued in some places, and in others they only relied on pegs. Either way, the main pieces of the garage were crooked. It took us a lot of extra time to even it all out. Regardless of the construction errors, we have many great comments. The furniture was abundant (even though the colors didn't always match the images provided). They were great quality. Everything but the garage was perfect. The garage was not only hard to build, but many pieces  (like the garage doors) had started to peel. Aside from all of my adult complaints, my girls love it.

I strongly advise having a few pics of the dollhouse on hand for reference and a YouTube video I saw helped me figure out the side panel issue (the panels overlap to be screwed in)-after that it was not hard at all to put the house together. The screws are all  very clearly labeled and the parts of the doll house are numbered. I only used my own Phillips head screw driver and the little tool provided. It took me 2.5 -3 hrs to put it all together. I’m a mom, not an engineer-you’ll be fine. The dollhouse is awesome! And it comes with so much furniture and even a mini chandelier to hang.

1561,1.0,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware.  This looks amazing and I suppose once it it put together it could be fun - but getting there is a horrible ordeal.  First, it comes in an incredibly heavy box with every single piece separate.  That in itself would be fine if it included anything even like IKEA instructions - but it doesn't.  Pieces need to go in very specifically, however the instructions are not detailed or in color (which would help tremendously when dealing with multiple bolts, screws and holes.  The only way I could get this together correctly is by really putting on my puzzle solving hat and consulting the picture on the Amazon page.  No picture is included on the box or in the instructions.  As you can tell from the pictures on amazon - they are from one angle only - so a lot of guess work is needed.  Now let's get to the craftmanship - shoddy all the way around.  Cheap bolts and screws, pieces that do not line up - some pieces that have been assembled in the factory don't line up - or aren't flush as they should be.  Places where you need to insert fastening bolts into holes were impossible because epoxy from the factory had dripped into the holes.  So you are halfway through this incredibly long build - to find out that you need to disassemble it to remove this crud from the holes before you can move on.  The paint used on the screws to blend with the walls and furniture pieces are not the same paint color.  Cheap all the way around.  3 hours of my life I will never get back.  Not to mention, when you have an incredibly excited 3 year old jumping around trying to help - it becomes incredibly frustrating to need to have her leave the room - just so you can concentrate enough to get this thing together.  I did this by myself, by I advise a second person to help.  It is incredibly big and awkward to assemble.  Get it pre-assembled or forget about it.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGMRCHTJHVCNWVMAQQ6HGFMVXAXQ,1485534971000,6,True

I got it for $139 (down from 169) with free shipping so I was shocked to see the price here of over $300.  I would not have bought it for that much simply because we are not rich. However, I do think it is worth it. I read all the reviews on it beforehand and was a little concerned about the ""wallpaper"" issue some seemed to have. Maybe that was an older model because there is no wallpaper. All scenery is printed directly onto it. This was easy to assemble with 2 people (and we are severely challenged in this area normally).  The only thing I didn't like was the way the screws were packaged. I think if they put them in separate bags, it would have been better. I also agree with the reviews about the elevator, but we just put some grease in it and it is fine.  It is HUGE...much bigger than I thought but it DOES come with wall attachments so you can attach it to a wall and living in earthquake land, I was glad about that.  I had an issue with the refrigerator, it was broken in the packaging but it couldn't have been easier to replace. I went on the website and put in my item number and address and boom, it is set to be delivered. They didn't ask for a receipt or anything. So I am not clear about the 90 days other are talking about.  I cant wait to see my 3 year old's face when she sees this for Christmas.

1629,5.0,WOW!  I was surprised when I was finished!!! NICE PRODUCT!!,"Granddaughters are going to love it.  Better built than my expectations.  NOTE: When you are constructing this monstrosity, take your time.  Check to ensure that the holes line-up (and they do!), that the print is on the right side, and don't force anything (i.e. roof will line up and since its is on an angle, let the screws draw themselves into the pre-drilled holes).  The instructions are simple and almost clear on what to do.  It will not show you the &#34;print&#34; on the part you are installing.  I used the box and a YouTube video on this mansion for my install.  I watched the video and checked the box before finalizing my install.  The reason is that this product is mainly wood fiber and pine.  Both are soft woods and if you stress them during install, it will leave a weaken joints and time will wear them down faster.  After all my joints were tight, I checked them again and made sure all joints, etc. were aligned before I applied my final torque to the screws.  Not to tight, just snug.  The final result was a sturdy and beautiful dollhouse my grand kids will adore and probably have for a very long time.  Nicely done KidKraft.<br /><br />NOTE: During shipping, my mansion patio roof panel was scratched in a spot to the wood.  I contacted KidKraft and within four days, I was placing the replacement roof on the doll house.  Wow, just WOW!!  That is customer service!!!!

We were originally looking at some other KidCraft dollhouses but noticed that none of them had a nursery (what little girl doesn't want to have a nursery for her dolls' babies?).

1633,5.0,"For the price, this dollhouse is in a class by itself.","I bought this dollhouse after returning a similarly priced Barbie house to a local store. The Barbie house was made of plastic and we returned it because it had broken pieces upon opening it. The KidKraft Majestic Mansion Dollhouse is in a class by itself. I knew when I opened the box that I had bought a well made, sturdy product. The quality of the pieces was way better than I was expecting for the price. Almost every piece is made of wood. The packaging is such that every surface piece is protected from scratching by individual pieces of padded paper. It took me about 2 hours to put this together by myself. I was taking my time and recovering from a recent wrist fracture so that's probably longer than it would take most people. The complexity of assembly was low. There are two main types of hardware in use and maybe 6 different types total, so you don't have to pick through a dozen types of screws to determine which one to use, go back later and re-assemble it when you realize you used the wrong one, etc. My daughter was absolutely thrilled with the end product, and we consider ourselves fortunate that the previously purchased Barbie house was dead on arrival, because we ended up with a much better dollhouse. My one complaint / suggestion for improvement is on the anchor that is used to tether the dollhouse to the wall (to keep it from tipping). The placement of the bolt/nut is in a hole in one of the walls on the third floor. With a significant pull on this item, you could displace the wall - it would have been better to put pre-drilled screw holes in one of the solid wooden pieces.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW43qSvRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW43qSvRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW43qSvRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGZL6PSFOG2T44PZ5KLGYL4SRR4A,1577841052579,0,True

1651,5.0,"Big enough for full size 'Barbie"" dolls","We just gave this to our 7 year old as a Christmas gift. She went CrAzY! I had no idea this thing was so big! Although not 'Barbie' Brand name, I find it is better quality than their doll houses, sorry but true. And the full sized 'Barbies' fit with ample room! This house is not plastic but rather made from wood and put together with cabinet quality machine-grade steel fasteners! No silly plastic push-pins and such here. Very impressive quality! I have seen cabinetry that was not built as well as this doll house, Seriously! The fit and finish is amazing. Comes with complete and detailed instructions for assembly. It will take You about 1- 1/2 to 2 hours to put it together. Everything is detailed in the assembly instructions and I mean the locations of every nut, bolt and screw to include the color-coded painted ones that match the doll house wallpaper so as to hide them!!! If You can read and turn a screwdriver then You can put this doll house together, it just takes a little time. And my little girl is worth it! It does not 'snap' together. It comes complete with a full set of furniture made from real wood! Even the bed has a soft attached mattress covered with cloth. Amazing value for the price! In this day and age of disposable junk it is refreshing to find something of such value. I venture to use the word 'Intrinsic'. It comes completely packed to a 'T' so as to not scratch the detailed finish. Unload the box carefully, don't just turn it over and dump it on the floor. The box is heavy and You may need some help moving it. After I put hers together I simply pulled it along the floor over by the Christmas tree, so You don't need to pick it up to move it. This doll house will last her for years, no doubt. I give it 5 Stars!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AG6SSUY5BJA2B2IVOBHVP4I32OIQ,1388260914000,1,True

1654,5.0,Great buy! Great quality!,"This doll house is amazing. It was extremely easy to assemble. Also, it is very sturdy. The instruction quality needs improvement. I think the instructions should include pictures and clarify which direction each piece should go in. If you do not pay attention to the images on each piece you may install them in the wrong direction. For example, when installing the roof we had to pay close attention to the direction of the shingles. If you don’t pay attention to the direction of how the shingles are pointing then you can accidentally install it wrong. Other than the instruction quality this was a great purchase. I am satisfied with my purchase. My daughters will be able to play with this house for years to come because it’s made out of MDF wood.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811nZGZVNtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811nZGZVNtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811nZGZVNtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGNJ7V6SYFQEDGMUNLYATM2ZOKYQ,1609179547732,2,True

1663,5.0,Great Toy,"The kit is beautifully packaged, way above average, and all the pieces and hardware are numbered or lettered.  And they give you extra hardware in case a screw gets buried in the carpet or your little helper flushes a bolt. Below are a few things I encountered that don't show in the YouTube assembly videos.<br />  Steps 1 and 2.  You have to put pieces 1 and 3 into piece 5.  The holes in piece 5 look as if 1 and 3 could go on to either side.  But the distance between the holes in 5 are different from one side to another.  Pick the wrong two and piece 6 will not slide into place in step two.  You can either measure the distance you need or put pieces 1 and 3 in loosely to check whether 6 will fit.  Piece 5 has tile on one side and wood on the other.  KidKraft wants the tile side to be on the interior of the elevator both top and bottom<br />  Step 4 You attach the elevator to ""sliders"" on piece 8.  Each slider has four holes drilled but you use only the middle two,<br />  Steps 17-25 Garage.  The pieces for the house fit well and everything went together smoothly.  But the garage pieces didn't fit as well.  (If the dadoes are off by even 1/16 inch a panel may not fit as it should.)  In the end everything worked out fine but a few additional tools were needed.  In this case clamp, trim saw and rubber mallet.<br />  Total assembly took around four hours.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AF775XWKK7J2SGUT6DFZREHK7YJA,1625337406561,0,False

1676,5.0,Great doll house!,"I bought this doll house to give my daughter for her birthday in September. Bought it ahead of time because I was afraid there would be any missing or defective parts. I was able to get this doll house for less than $170.00 and shipping was totally free!!! This doll house also includes all the furniture which made it my final purchase when I decided to buy it. Other doll houses in the market do not include furniture naking it a lot more expensive when you have to buy them separate.<br />Directions for the item were fairly easy considering I am a very handy person and love to do things myself! It took me only 3 hours to assemble from opening the box to the very final screw!<br />I love the doll house and think it is very sturdy. It is a very good product considering the amount of money I paid for it. Beware, some other websites can charge up to $599.99 for same doll house but a little bit of shopping around can get you going for less than $170.00.<br />After completion of this product assembly I was missing 2 I-screws that go on the garage door. Next day I called the 1800 number on the instructions page and without any questioning I was sent new hardware, free of charge.<br />The only thing I did not manage to do well was to hide the doll house from my daughter. I left it in the family room and covered with a large bed sheet but she figured that out quickly because of the shape of the roof. Since this is a birthday gift to her, as a tease, I let her play with it a little bit and told her she could use the house for her lalaloopsy mini at this time.<br />Overall, great product that promises hours and hours of indoors play for either one, two, or more children together.<br />I am very satisfied with my purchase!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHKAU3J6EX4ISDVVIPWDZIHOANGQ,1310126747000,0,True

1716,3.0,Decent quality at best but the instructions were actually very wrong.,"I would say I’m an 8 in terms of getting things done around the house or building things.  Yes.  I did wait till Christmas Eve this year to build the house.  Yes I did read reviews warning of that.  However not having a place to hid it I worked away.  A solid 4 hours to build.  Problem was that the instructions included skip steps.  For example stairs require 3 screws but instructions show only 1 needed.  Was an issue on every page. Fortunately found instructions on Amazon and sure enough PDF has all the steps I found missing, but now included.<br /><br />As for quality vs cost I have no idea. I think paying what I did I get quite a bit.  Will it hold up to my 3 year old climbing on it? Nope.  I wouldn’t expect that anyway.  A little let down on panel finishes, corners all peeling but it’s for a 3 year old not an adult model builder so a painful pass.<br /><br />Again my largest beef was instructions.  Some panels didn’t have numbers and had to reference pictures to get an idea what side was up (elevator specific) and what went where.<br /><br />I recommend paying someone a few hundred dollars to create actual instructions that match. Perhaps (wood floor side up) type comments.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFLNGKMWRUMEE5WMDJIR2IV3HURA,1577268271593,0,True

The instructions were perfectly in order, and I had next to no issues with assembling it. The only thing that would not assemble the way it was intended were the little knobs on the garage door. The screws will not go in without splitting the wood of the knobs so I will be using hot glue to put them on the door. That was the only piece that gave me that kind of issue so I can look past it as I have an easy fix for it. My daughter is absolutely thrilled with it!

My two kids have enjoyed playing with it since Christmas morning. I especially like all the furniture it came with and it's very bright and colorful. A few things to consider: I did pay someone to put it together and it took a few hours. The top level (the baby's room) is very high. My kids can not reach it (4.5 years and 20 months). I knew this would be the case from the video demo. But I guess I didn't anticipate my kids constantly using a bench to reach up there! It's like that's their favorite level! Also my littlest one has climbed into the garage and the other rooms and I've had to yell at him to get out! It's still in my living room (we haven't had chance to take it downstairs to the playroom yet) but when it does find its permanent home, it has to be bolted to the wall somehow, because I'm convinced it will topple over. It's not against a wall now, and it shakes slightly which scares me! The first reaction from everyone that sees it, is WOW that's BIG followed up by its beautiful. I sort of wish I ordered a smaller one. It would have served the same purpose, but I had the space so I figured why not?",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFGYMPWYRAZBHLBLMZ5LF2345H6A,1389129495000,0,True

The reason for the non-five star review is simply because the piecing it together process. The directions are all photos with no words. You can kind of make out what it what, however I had to clue what design was on what end. The diagram will show a square piece with the number 10 using a letter screw (how they are identified) but the numbered pieces could sometimes be an either or. Sometimes I’d have to back track to fix it which was a pain or I had to skip ahead to see if I could figure it out. Simple fix would be to just clarify it in the directions. The second issue I had was some screw holes not aligning. Especially the roof. That’s like a the piece puzzle but the holes are in the wrong spot which made the front of the roof tighter than the back. Made it work by creating my own holes in the right spot. Third issue was some of the screw holes wet too close to the edges and not in the middle so when you put the screw in it cuts through the sides or cracks the boards. My little one is pretty gentle so it should be good, but the initial frustration and a few screws in the wrong spot took down a star.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHRNE4VFKO4UFGZYSO5TJXOMA3KA,1577665899634,0,True

It’s quite sturdy and the furniture that comes with it is nice. I ordered people and pets to go with it. Only a couple of drawbacks.  The instructions for assembly are sketchy at best.

I saw this house on amazon for $100 back in October and I had to have it. Their legal disclaimer says they do not ship APO but I figured I would try anyway.... not only did it arrive in a timely manner but nothing was damaged!! This is a huge deal considering the weight of the box and how far it had to come! I was over joyed to be able to get this for my 6 year old for Christmas. There are also about 3-1/2 small boxes of furniture for the house as well. It took me about 3 hrs to put the house together alone (with a clingy baby) the instructions could have been a little clearer and I am disappointed in the paper they used for the inside and outside of the doll house. It does chip at the edges if you bump them while putting it together.

1836,4.0,Huge! Perfect for lol dolls.,My husband spent 2.5 hours putting this house together. It's easy to move once assembled though. It's huge. I gave it 4 stars due to it not having alot of furniture. I think it should definitely come with more. Some of the furniture was pointless imo. Plants and a clock and pianos? I found those things unnecessary. It needed more furniture for sure. My 3 year old loves it. Although she can't reach the top room of the house just yet lol So if you have toddlers the top room is not usable for a bit. But I knew that before purchasing. I bought it for her to use for a long time. The garage for cars doesn't fit lol cars or basic barbie cars they will hang out of the garage. Lol dolls and barbies fit great on the furniture. But again I think it needed more furniture. The bed should come with a blanket too. A few of the pieces are plastic not wood. I think a toilet and vanity are plastic not wooden.

1837,5.0,Excellent product.,"This was a gift for my niece for Christmas and she loves it. It has given her hours of playtime. Her cousins visited her and it's kept them engaged, their imagination is being revealed by the minute. She absolutely, positively loves it. The size is great because it life size & she's able to play with multiple people & they're able to move around, engage in conversations and enjoy rearranging the furniture, playing with all her dolls, and just have fun. The fun part is her cousins don't want to go home 😂. So I have my hands filled with 3 little princesses 😍",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFLVTZVOLVI63DOZSR25K33RJYNQ,1577376243767,0,True

We got a great deal on the price since it was on sale for the Christmas holiday except for the shipping. We have an APO address in Japan and it wouldn't ship here through Amazon so I had it sent to my sisters house and she shipped it to us, the cost of shipping was $75 but it was worth it because my daughter was so excited and surprised Christmas morning. Everything arrived in good condition. It fits all her monster high and Brat dolls so pretty much any Barbie size doll or smaller would work with this house. The piano is the only  piece of furniture that keeps coming apart so I may just super the legs on so they'll stay but overall the furniture pieces are really sturdy and well put together.

1860,5.0,Beyond Wildest Dreams,"For this past Christmas, my husband and I really wanted to get an over-the-top gift for our 5-year-old since her big sister seemed to always get the fun electronics, etc.  Being the girly girl and doll lover that she is, I figured what better gift than a real, life-size dollhouse that will grow with her.  I did lots of research and discovered that there were more dollhouses out there than what I expected.  I took the plunge and bought this one.  When it arrived (very quickly, I might add), I found myself very excited to put it together and play with it myself!  Finally, Christmas arrived and my husband and I immediately started putting it together.  Right away, I noticed the attention to detail (skid marks in garage, etc) was top-notch.  I'll admit, the customer reviews about it taking 2 hours to put together were spot on.  It might have taken less time if our antsy new dollhouse owner wasn't ""checking in"" every 2 minutes and us shooing her away.  I highly recommend you put this together in the room where it will stay.  It is quite heavy once fully assembled.  One thing I was surprised about was how tall it is.  Our daughter is pretty tall, and even she can't reach the top floor without using a stool.  Overall, this product is highly recommended.  The only negative thing I could say is the screws underneath the elevator started scratching the floor on the second level after about a week of repeated use.  It might be helpful to cover the screws with tape after assembly.  To completely blow your child's socks off, consider purchasing a separate doll family to go with it.  It's equipped to use Barbie-size dolls, put small hands do better with the small wooden dolls, I think.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGDULJHQVRGXOF5YBLTPXFPYCMNA,1359419897000,0,True

1910,5.0,"Military wives, single moms, etc... Here's a review for YOU!","As it always seems to work out, my husband is deployed for my daughter's third birthday. I'd like to call myself a ""pro"" at putting together children's toys and furniture at this point. So I'm going to break this review down for all you military wives, single moms, wives whose husbands travel for business, and the ladies who just want to do it themselves!<br /><br />Why I love Amazon.com -<br />They almost always have the best price! They offer free super saver shipping on many items. They ship things out very quickly and offer tracking on all of your packages!<br /><br />Why I love KidKraft -<br />Almost every big item we have for our daughters is made by Kidkraft (kitchen set, various kitchen accessories, table and chairs, bookshelves, toy box, train set and table, wall shelves, and now the dollhouse!) The packaging of the hardware is excellent and easy to find pieces. Everything is always VERY sturdy. It's a much more eco-friendly option than the big plastic pieces you can find by other companies. The price is right for the quality item you recieve. The customer service is one of the best I've ever come across. They even have a place on their website where you can order missing or broken parts without the hassle of having to call. (I've only ever needed a part once out of all of our items! They shipped it quick, even around Christmas time.) I suggest ordering ahead of time if you can, just in case you are missing a part or something is broken. That way you're not disappointed! And remember.. mistakes happen, we're all human!<br /><br />Why I love this dollhouse -<br />It IS HUGE! The children in the display photo are not scaled down. Some people may not like this, but I however; love it! We have two toddler girls, and needed something that would be big enough for both of them to play with to avoid future temper tantrums. For the price, you get double the dollhouse you get from other models that are just a small amount cheaper. It will accomodate Barbie dolls once my girls start playing with them instead of their other dolls. This is something we will have for a long time, and I am confidant that the girls will be able to grow into it, and that the construction will last!<br /><br />Some tips for construction by yourself, ladies! -<br />1. You will need a big (+) screwdriver and a little (+) screwdriver. You may need a (-) screwdriver to hold in some pieces at points. Kidkraft supplies the allen key. If you need a glass of wine, I suggest white, just in case it spills ;)<br />2. You will need a large space to build this, since there are points when the house will need to be on its side.<br />3. Unwrap all of your pieces. Read through all instructions before beginning as well as check and count all of your parts. I personally go through step by step and place the parts I will need in bunches.<br />4. Make sure you have the time to do this all. You will only get frustrated if the kids are awake, or you set a time limit to get this all done by! I did this during naptime and once the girls were in bed. All in all I think it took me about 2.5 hours to get it done, but this is also coming from a woman who can do this stuff with her eyes closed at this point.<br />5. Take your time to really look at the photos in the instruction manual. Plan it all out in your head first, then do it.<br />6.  If the screw's paint doesn't match the spot it's in.. it's in the wrong place.<br />7. If something needs to be forced, it's probably in the wrong place or you need a new part. Kidkraft's items usually go together seamlessly. This is another reason I am a huge fan.<br />8. The wall makes a good ""partner."" If you need to hold something up, just put it against the wall.<br />9. Take your time, and don't get frustrated. You'll be SO proud when it's all done!<br /><br />Some more fun facts -<br />I am 5'1"", and the house is almost as tall as I am. If you are short.. get a step stool to screw the roof on! The box is 70lbs. when shipped. If you can, get your delivery man to place it right where you are going to set it up.. especially if you're a pregnant momma!<br /><br />I hope this helped!<br />Overall I would recommend this dollhouse to all of my friends and family. My daughter has not yet played with it, but I just know that from the moment she wakes up on her birthday that this house will be played with daily for years to come!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEXBNHZISGIEILGAMZ6XBTIE3Z2A,1298987404000,1409,True

It is true,  the instructions are terrible, but that is nothing compared to how poorly the pre-drilled holes line up. I am lucky that I only broke one of the panels trying to force the floors together just to get a bolt through a hole in the wood.<br /><br />The laminate art is also peeling away from at least one edge of almost every piece of this toy. It is very cheaply made, even compared to the other Kid Kraft items we have.<br /><br />If it wasn't Christmas Eve (or if Santa had a different gift to give my daughter) this POS would be going back. I am guessing that this item is only a good seller because it would be impossible to return once it is built.<br /><br />It took me just under 3 hours to build, and one whole section is not complete because the bolts won't fit.

1939,5.0,Very Happy Little Girl,"This dollhouse was exactly what we were looking for. Our daughter loves it! It truly is a huge structure. The materials used are very sturdy and should stand up to some abuse.  The front rails and vertical supports allow for you to put a lot of pressure each floor without it breaking. We were concerned about this because of our climbing toddler. He has not been able to damage it.  The instructions were very easy to understand, and where they were lacking you can use the large picture on the box to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />Assembly:<br /><br />It took about 2 hours to put together. My advice would be to buy a hex set of bits for your drill.  They cost 5 to 10 dollars at any hardware store and will make this project much easier. If you assemble the house with the Alan wrenches provided I can see how it may take a whole day to put together. Be careful not to over tighten the bolts it will split the wood. Stand up all the pieces against your walls with the numbers exposed. It makes finding them much easier. All the assembly hardware (screws, bolts, etc.) comes on a sheet. The best way to get the bolts out is to slice the plastic on the front with a box cutter. If you try to remove them from the back through the cardboard you will just frustrate yourself.<br /><br />Overall, we are very satisfied with this purchase.  We would recommend this house to anyone.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGUCMDQIM66B6RQASVVVRHC247SQ,1356967167000,0,True

If its for a special occasion, you may want to plan ahead. It took all of 4 hours BUT there were 3 of us ""know it all"" family members trying to assemble. So it may go easier for you. :)  All in all when we were done it was worth it. The middle part of the roof is loose because the screws don't match up with the holes but that really doesn't matter. It's not like my child will be pushing the big house around. Some parts of the home are the particle board material & some parts are thick wood. The furniture prices are adorable. They are thick wood.  I had trouble with the pink bed, the screw for the foot bed DIdnt match with hole again but that's an easy fix. I believe we will have many years of this dollhouse.

AFTER LOOKING AT THE MATTEL PRODUCT WHICH IS MOSTLY PLASTIC, I FOUND THIS ON AMAZON. ORDERED IT FROM VMINNOVATIONS AND THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY DELIVERED IT WAS AMAZING. I ORDERED IT AROUND 9:30 PM WED. NIGHT THANKGIVING EVE AND IT ARRIVED ON SAT. AFTER THANKSGIVING. LESS THAN 3 DAYS ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND. BOX ARRIVED AND IT WAS WELL PACKED. I READ ANYWHERE BETWEEN 21/2 HOURS TO 5 HOURS TO PUT TOGETHER. DEFFINATELY TAKE YOUR TIME, BECAUSE THE INSTRUCTIONS DONT SHOW YOU WHICH SIDE OF SOME OF THE PANELS TO USE. A LITTLE ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND COMMON SENSE HELPS HERE. I FOLLOWED SOME OTHER REVIEWERS ADVICE AND USED WOOD GLUE WHEN ASSEMBLING AND THIS THING IS VERY STURDY. DEFFINATELY WILL HOLD UP TO HOURS OF PLAY TIME. THE FURNITURE IS VERY CUTE, EVERYTHING IS MADE OF WOOD AND HAS CUSHIONING AND FABRIC DETAIL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS KIDKRAFT PRODUCT OVER THE MATTEL HOUSE. AS FOR SOME OF THE REVIEWERS MENTIONING THE ELEVATOR BECOMING HARD TO USE I HAVE A SIMPLE SOLUTION. REMOVE THE CAP FROM THE ELEVATOR RAIL AND REMOVE THE ELEVATOR SLIDERS. YOU WILL SEE A METAL BRACKET ON THE FACE OF THE SLIDERS. CVAREFULLY REMOVE THIS CAP THAT HOLDS A BALL BEARING AND A SPRING SIMILAR TO A BALL POINT PEN SPRING. WITH A SMALL PAIR OF SNIPS, REMOVE A FEW COILS OF THE SPRING AND REASSEMBLE SLIDERS. THIS WILL ALLOW THE ELEVATOR TO MOVE MORE FREELY. I MAY HAVE OVERDONE IT BECAUSE THE ELEVATOR SLOWLY FALLS TO THE FIRST FLOOR BUT I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN THE CHILD NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE THE ELEVATOR AT ALL.

The majority is like a mdf type of material with the paper glued on, and in a few places it's peeling off in the corner or edge. It looks like when they manufacture it they make a large sheet, attache the paper, then cut it, so it curls up on the edge.  Most places that it's doing that, I don't think my daughter will snag it, so it shouldn't be a problem.  All the other trim is made of wood.

2009,4.0,Great quality but assembly instruction can be improved,"Very nice dollhouse.  I bought it for my 4-year old but I really liked it and wish I had one when I was little.<br />Pros - the product is of the best quality for a toy.  Pictures are beautifully painted and furniture pieces are well made.  Of the 80 parts not even a single one was damaged/missing/defective.  Extra nuts and bolts are provided for convenience.  This is not one of those disposable toys but something your child can keep for a long time.<br />Cons - assembly can be a pain, and there is a lot to improve on the assembly instruction, as mentioned by other reviewers.  First of all, there is not even a color picture of what the dollhouse looks like.  Second, all the steps are in black and white pictures without any explanation.  In the first 30 minutes I did double if the assembly was even a mission possible. There were a few instances in which I had to take assembly apart after realizing I got the wrong side (floor up etc.).  I think many other customers had to refer to kidkraft website to figure things out.

The elevator looks like it may break soon, but everything else seems sturdy.  My son and I put this together in about 3 hours; you really need two people for some steps, but we had a lot of fun.  It is HEAVY and requires two people to move; parents with smaller kids should really bolt this to the wall (it comes with bolts).  I also purchased wooden doll house people, but they are too small for this set.  A figure one to two inches smaller than a Barbie would be ideal.  But my daughter told me not to return them; we had fun seeing how small they were compared to the house and she pretend they are Barbie's kids!  All in all, we are very satisfied.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEI5Y7AD5SVYZ3NS4OJZWRPZFRMQ,1293452997000,2,True
2023,4.0,Impressive quality for the pirce,"My daughters birthday is this weekedn, so she has yet to play with this item.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the quality of materials, the ease of assembly, the ease of ordering replacement parts,  and size of the house. Especially for the price.  While the unit did arrive with 8 broken pieces, the reorder process was extremely easy and quick. You simply visit the manufacturers website and enter in the item numbers you need replaced, provide your address and you're done.  No creating an account, no phone calls deciphering broken English. I really expected to get a phone call with some sort of verification of purchase. Quite frankly i felt like you could order this entire thing as replacement parts.  Anyway, very please with that process after finding a number of broken pieces.  Also it stated 7-10 days shipping and I believe we received our parts in 3-5 days.<br /><br />Once we had every piece intact, assembly was a breeze. Instructions were clear and only once or twice was there a step where a little more detail would have been appreciated. I was particularly impressed with the craftsmanship. All the holes and grooves were on center. Cuts were smooth and polished.  With so much cheaply and quickly made junk coming out of China, this was refreshing. I had only one screw hole that did not line up with the hole in the piece it was being attached to (there were three holes to line up, and one was off by a good 1/8"" - 1/4""). This unit is mostly held together by bolts that screw into threaded cylinders instead of the typical hardware of modular furniture(the pegs that get pushed into the disks that you turn and ""pinch"" tight). This is nice as you wont have to mess with re-tightening regularly.<br /><br />Again my daughter has not used this item so my review is based solely on my experience of receiving the item, dealing with ordering replacement parts, and construction. While I feel like the unit will be very durable, time will tell.<br /><br />My only complaint so far is the elevator. It attaches to the unit by screwing one of the cardboard walls to two pieces of plastic that are in a channel (two screws into each plastic piece). The plastic pieces pinch in the channel so that the elevator can remain suspended. This makes it difficult to move and with the elevator only being held on by a few screw points, feels flimsy. I feel like my daughter (4yrs) is going to have a tough time operating it and that it might not hold up to use. In light of the other houses I found, I don't feel the elevator is a show stopper.<br /><br />I was drawn to this item:<br /><br />- For it's size. I think it's cool that it's going to dwarf my daughter.<br />- It is scaled for Fashion dolls (Barbie, Disney). A lot of houses seem to be for ornate show or scaled for smaller dolls.<br />- For it's value. Other houses go for this price to upwards of $600 and are much smaller.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFF25CDZU7HLL7FKHPIV6UIVTF4A,1320343347000,0,True

2027,4.0,this is a great dollhouse. My daughters love it,"*EDITED 1/29/16 AFTER SPEAKING WITH KIDKRAFT* LEAVING MY FOUR STAR RATING FOR THE DOLLHOUSE ITSELF BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM KIDKRAFT IS A BIG ZERO RIGHT NOW....<br /><br />In my original review, I explained how we received a duplicate of one of the accessory boxes and were missing one of the other boxes. My first couple calls to KidKraft AFTER January 1st, I could not get a live person on the phone. Rather it was a voicemail message stating that I would have to leave a message so that my order could be filled BEFORE Christmas (mind you it was now a week AFTER Christmas...).<br /><br />I eventually got someone on the phone the third week of January (after giving my daily call a rest for awhile). The very nice lady who answered stated that I would need a &#34;batch code&#34; off of the bottom of the dollhouse or from the instructions. I explained to her that I needed box &#34;B&#34; and would there be anything else she needs from me. No, she told me, just the batch code and that box letter.<br /><br />Fast forward to today when I called and got the RUDEST woman on the phone. I explained to her that I had the batch code and would like to get the box that was missing. She cut me off to tell me she couldnt do anything without the list. I told her that I have the batch code and the name of the house. She very rudely told me that she cant help me with that, that I needed &#34;THE LIST&#34;. I explained that I was missing box &#34;b&#34; - that I received box &#34;a&#34; and &#34;c&#34; - and what other information does she need other than that? She huffed at me and told me I need to tell her WHAT I'm missing. After explaining to her that I dont KNOW what I'm missing as I'm missing a BOX of stuff she basically sneered at me and told me to go look it up in the directions and call back once I have a list of everything I'm missing.<br /><br />After a very deep breath to keep from snapping at this woman, I explained to her that the dollhouse was a gift that has since been put together - and played with - as it was a Christmas gift and as I started to explain that I was unable to get a hold of a live person until just last week she cut me off by saying &#34;LOOK I cant do anything for you without a list of what you are missing.&#34; I thanked her abruptly and hung up.<br /><br />Overall, the ATTITUDE was the worst of this. I can (vaguely) understand how the company may need a list of the items I am missing (though I did speak to the first woman who stated I only needed the box letter) but on the other hand, I would think that if the boxes are LABELED then they are labeled for a reason. Since I dont have the (rather thick) instruction book sitting in front of me, I cant say how difficult this task will be - especially considering most of the accessory pieces have been played with and are God knows where... - but I will say that I will probably be even more irritated if I find that the accessories are listed BY BOX in the instructions...<br /><br />Hopefully my next call I'll get a much nicer representative on the phone who will be much more helpful!<br /><br />********************************************************<br /><br />Overall, this is a great dollhouse. My daughters love it, its spacious and has lots of little extras (the included furniture, the elevator, the details). It's big enough to fit Barbie and Monster High dolls, which is what my girls wanted - they think they got a Barbie dream house, I think I got much nicer dollhouse for a fraction of the price (while on sale) and much better quality.<br /><br />However.. there are a few downsides. After seeing another KidCraft dollhouse in Costco, I expected this house to be made with the same thick wooden/pressboard walls; it is not. The top and sides are much thinner and are more like thin sheetrock rather than thick pressboard. I still think it will hold up well for the most part, though I do wish it was a little sturdier in that respect.<br /><br />Also, we did have an issue with the contents of the box. This was purchased as a new item (and it came as a new item) however, there was supposed to be three furniture/accessory boxes; we did receive three, but two of the boxes were the same (there should have been a box A, B and C; we got two A's and one C box). I'm not sure what should have been in box B and did not realize that the boxes were duplicated until we had everything out and put together. I have not been in contact with the company yet to fix this but am hoping they will be able to send us that missing B box.<br /><br />Aside from those two issues, the dollhouse is pretty awesome and I would recommend it to anyone.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEDDFS4S3W6TKDAXRZTM55STBUJA,1452010015000,2,True

2046,4.0,Better than a Dream House,"I ordered this dollhouse for our daughter's big Santa gift this year when I found it at a great price. I had the package in my basement for a month before I tackled putting it together. I read all the previous reviews on assembly time so I knew it would take awhile. That said it did take me roughly 5 hours to put together. I did it by myself and at a leisurely pace. I will say there were a few times an extra set of hands would have helped but they are not necessary at all. As with most kidkraft wooden toys there are bolt/nuts that drop in and the screws thread through them for a better fit when attaching the pieces. Some are difficult to line up with just two hands, but not impossible. One took me almost 15-20 minutes just because it was at an awkward angle. That was the only delay in assembly that I found. My shipment arrived quickly and had all the pieces. One piece of furniture did arrive slightly damaged but I sent an email for a replacement, ordering online was easy and hopefully it will arrive in a week or so. I intentionally put the house together early in case something was missing or damaged. I read other reviews on here and took the advise to put vaseline on the metal track of the elevator. THIS IS A MUST. It makes the elevator glide super easy since this is a problem most people seem to have with the house. Design wise, the house is BEAUTIFUL and makes me jealous! I can remember getting my barbie dreamhouse as a child and this is so much better, I can't wait for my three year old daughter to wake up Christmas morning and play with her!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHTMMYUPBQKOOKQS6EOANWWDRIXQ,1323565196000,1,True

2063,5.0,Best dollhouse you can buy!,"I looked at over fifty dollhouses online and in retail stores but kept coming back to this house.  We have several KidKraft products and have been really pleased with their quality and durability, but to be honest, the big draw for this item was its size.  It's huge!  One criteria I had for a doll house was that it would be big enough to grow with my child so she could have several years of play with it without it seeming too small.  Another criteria was that it would be big enough to accomodate dollhouse dolls and 12 inch dolls - aka her Barbies.  The large format makes it easy for little hands to manipulate furniture and play with dolls and gives plenty of room for adding in other toys - Little People, the Barbie convertible and more have reappeared this week as our daughter has played with the house.<br /><br />Don't let the size intimidate you.  It's not difficult to put together.  My husband assembled it over the course of a couple evenings while also watching TV; one person can easily do this by himself/herself.  Moving it is best with two people, though.<br /><br />The collection of furniture and accessories is great, too.  There are several items for each room (two for the bathroom), and I supplemented with the Fun Toys and Pet and Accessories Furniture sets by Plan Toys.  The furniture is equally well-made, and a Barbie doll easily fits on the bed.<br /><br />No regrets here!  We love the Majestic Dollhouse, and so does our daughter.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHIAH254ER4SUN7FGAXH3W5PCW4Q,1325261114000,0,True

2066,1.0,Very disappointed.,"We bought this for my girls for Christmas. First off, it's a giant pain to put together and the screws/pieces weren't marked properly (either in the instruction manual or I got sent the wrong package of screws). I was able to make it all work but I had to improvise. It took me 3 nights of 3+ hours of work to get it all assembled, and I'm not inept or impaired. I've assembled more toys then I can count and I've done a ton of small projects and stuff that requires using a screw driver (that's all you need to put it together). Well I finally got it all together and it looks great. The girls were so happy on Christmas morning and it fits their barbies wonderfully. Fast foward to 3 weeks later, and probably half of the wooden furniture is falling apart or broke already. The way they join the pieces when assembling is with, what I'm assuming, glue. Well it didn't last very long.. The glued pieces have all come apart and I've had to super glue them back together. On some of the pieces the wood has split (the wooden stove. The side split and the door fell off). I really expected these things to last MUCH longer considering it's wooden and it's 170 bucks. I am very unhappy with this overall.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFU5SFTKNQE7LSEA3R4XD6FY5E5A,1422223436000,5,False

2085,5.0,Best Dollhoue Out There,"Purchased for my four year old daughter for Christmas of 2011. The priceless look on her beautiful face, at that very moment, cleary made me see what this is all about! As the four old heaed off the Grandma's for the day to make her cookies for Santa and also prepare carrots for his reindeer, Mommy and Daddy assembled the dollhouse. In all it took about 2 1/2 hrs. Best tip to give, definitely use a little crisco or wd-40 for the elevator tracks. My little girl has played with this non stop since she has got it. I love going in there and playing barbies with her. Defintely reminds me of such simpler times when I was younger. I as so over the moon that she loves this house and suspect she will love it for years to come. KidKraft makes a great line of products.

2090,5.0,Huge and great quality! Worth the money!,"Unlike many reviews, I thought this was pretty simple to put together. I started on it at about 9:30 pm on xmas eve and was done before midnight, doing most of it myself. I didn’t have any issues with parts not fitting correctly - it all went pretty smooth. When I first opened the box I was pretty intimidated and assumed it was going to be an all night task but once I got all the pieces laid out and took my time with the instructions it wasn’t bad at all. I didn’t need any special tools…just a screwdriver. It also comes with a wall anchor - it’s big and heavy but I could definitely see it tipping over if a child is pulling on it/tries to climb it. It’s huge. I read dimensions and looked at so many reviewer pictures but once you actually see it put together in person…just wow lol. It’s almost obnoxious how big it is. I wish I would have purchased a slightly smaller one. But it’s great quality and definitely worth the money. The wooden furniture that comes with it is great quality too! It’s a huge hit with my daughter, she’s been playing with it nonstop. I recommend this, unless you have a house on the cozier side then I’d recommend selecting a smaller model lol.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fskjnGkAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fskjnGkAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fskjnGkAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFIZ2VYLEC2JE5C4WBJFA5TVVS7A,1640451016714,0,False

If you don't drink wine, a Bud will work just fine :-) My only other suggestion would be to unwrap ALL parts and arrange them in ascending numerical order.

As the mom 4”11 and it matches with my head as wide as my arms outstretched. This thing is a kids dream mansion for real. They have endless imagination. They play for hours nonstop. The mansion itself is very sturdy all the furniture pieces are hardwood as well I could see my girls playing with this for at least a good 5 years if not more because my little one has some years to grow into it. The 4 year old does have to stand on a step stool to play at the top level. All and all money well spent. My kids had a excellent Christmas thanks to amazon, kidkraft, and xcess limited. My husband wanted me to mention the the instructions and time frame of putting this mansion together. So on Christmas morning he started to unbox this beast around 11am ish and finished around 5pm ish. Over 100 pieces to put together like over 500 tiny screws to install the beast. A lot of file language was said putting this beast together a lot of frustration and prayer. I must add my husband is pretty good with following directions and good with his hands, but this beast worked his last nerve. The thing with him was every piece was numbered but the instructions were not helpful neither was the pictures. I had to go on YouTube and find videos of people putting this beast together. That was more helpful than what was given in the box. All and all we would buy this again and other kidkraft products because the final result makes it all so worth it. Plan ahead when preparing to put this kidkraft majestic mansion together. Even if you are the smartest at things like this, it will take some hours, make sure you have a helper this is easier with a two person job one to hold the mansion and the other to install.

Our daughters both love it and play with it all the time, they can't reach the top nursery without a stool but they dont seem to mind. It is Barbie compatible which was a relief! It took my husband and I about 3 hours to assemble. I would highly recommend!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AE565PYXJOW26X6LEKW6VUQ5DZUQ,1389724528000,0,True
2128,5.0,Every Little Girls Dream House,"I don't normally take the time to write a review and felt the need to on this KidKraft Majestic Mansion. We ordered this from Amazon before Christmas 2010 and including shipping it was less than $150.. What a STEAL :) - it shipped quickly and although assembly took 2 adults, 2+hours, pieces were marked numerically accordingly to assembly- overall wasn't too complicated. The furniture pieces that come with it fill the house nicely as one other owner stated. They are durable wood products with minimal assembly required. The elevator is slightly hard to maneuver up and down- light force is needed. I assume this so that it stays on the floor above and doesn't just glide down. The floors and wall are sturdy. This dollhouse easily accommodates 12"" barbie dolls. Caution must be taken as this unit is heavy and can be easily tipped and an injury could occur. Overall this is ABSOLUTELY the cutest dollhouse- Worth every penny! My 7 year old daughter loves her ""DREAM HOUSE"". She isn't able to reach the top floor on her own- but nontheless, loves it!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AE4UWTOSEXG5OKKQY4MB47ODCWTQ,1295833495000,4,True

2130,5.0,Great looking house easy replacement part process,"Would first like to start with my daughter hasn't had time to play with this yet, it's a birthday present and there are a few weeks to go until she will receive it but it will be hard to imagine her not loving this thing. It is a monster 4' 6&#34; tall and a little over a foot deep and very wide so lots of room to play, if you are buying it for a younger child I would suggest a pretty step stool to go with it or they will have trouble reaching the upper two floors. It also comes with furniture wall anchors and I will probably use them it is so tall. One other thing the inside and exterior sides of the house are decorated but not the &#34;back&#34; this is meant to be up against a wall, I had been wondering that before purchase.<br /><br />I am the primary builder of kid things in the house so I know the drill pretty well and I have to say this was really easy to build. Some folks have said they used wood glue to reinforce it but I really don't think it's necessary. I also like that if you wanted to take it apart again in sections to take to someone's house you could because once's it's built you would need a pick up or van to take it somewhere else and I feel that this toy is going to last through our kids and probably some nieces as well it's very nicely made.<br /><br />****If this is a gift you may want to assemble at least a week early!<br />If this is a gift you may want to at least open the box and carefully inspect the pieces a week before because we did have two broken pieces. Kidcraft has a phone number and website to get replacement parts. I used the website and ordering the pieces took just a few minutes and I received them two business days later completely free of charge (they say it can take 7-10 business days if they have them in stock so you may want to prepare) as a whole I was very impressed with this process I've had much worse experiences with other companies.<br />Once it's assembled hiding it is really the trick because it's about as big a dresser (that's what mine is currently hiding behind in our basement until the birthday arrives) and I had to stack some boxes on top of the dresser to hide the top of the house.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGGEC3KJUYCUBFTRX7YTEWSNWFKA,1395246154000,2,True

2149,2.0,"Poor quality, wrong instructions, started falling apart within a week.","First of all the house comes in a very heavy box. Some parts came damaged because there is no adequate cushioning. There are just a few thin pieces of styrofoam which can't really protect a heavy load. So some corners were damaged.<br />I consider myself pretty good at putting stuff together. In this case either instructions were wrong or parts were mislabeled. Either way, it took a while to put it together and I had to backtrack a few steps.<br />Finally when all was put together, I was somehow happy... for a week. After a week, floors started bending as seen on pictures. The gap between two floors became so large thet the dividing wall would not longer stay in place. Also same thing happened with the garage door which just fell out and will no longer stay put.<br />Also, customer service is horrible. By accident we ordered two houses. I realized that and within 10 minutes requested that one order be cancelled. I received the confirmation that customer service received my request yet neither order was cancelled. In fact once i received shipment notification, I emailed th again and told them to reverse the shipment. They told me to refuse the delivery, but fedex just dropped it off. So I received two shipments and they refuse to issue a return label so I can ship one back. Shipping it back will easily cost half the price of the house or more. So I'm forced to dispute the charge as I think I acted in a timely matter to cancel the order and they just didn't do their part.<br />Overall I'm not very happy with the purchase. I thought I was getting a quality product and instead it came damaged, instructions were wrong or parts mislabeled and it started falling apart a week after I put it together. No more Kidkraft products for me.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813KfqwXsYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813KfqwXsYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813KfqwXsYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YCv-Ge-IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YCv-Ge-IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YCv-Ge-IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YVGh+8coL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YVGh+8coL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YVGh+8coL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81g61u9bL-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81g61u9bL-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81g61u9bL-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFBY6RCATBV6SKRKRGCSRHRVVBKQ,1614528822739,0,True

2153,1.0,Warning! Attempted construction of product may increase chances of alcoholic consumption.,"This was our choice of house after quite a bit of research and figuring it was our best option outside building our own. It does fit Barbie dolls perfectly fine, a few of the furniture pieces (wood furniture requires no assembly) are just a tiny bit off but Barbie still sits and lays well enough. It was Santa's gift and her big one this year after a very long wait, imagine her eyes as we begin to immediately pull out broken pieces from an obvious multi-time return. Screws were stripped as if done on purpose, key wooden components were beaten almost to saw dust, all the interior walls are a very flimsy material sandwiched between paper with artwork but they peel very easily and honestly little of this house is wood at all. Expect paper and foam with just enough of a slight touch of wood to insult your intelligence. Their flirting with false advertising more than one often sees in most products and that's no exaggeration. Please people, either pass on this, double check it before presenting or take that hard earned money and build one yourself. Even with diorama and model experience this thing was beyond being able to salvage. It's unreasonable for any parent to deal with this at all and children should never know such disappointment.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91I-NVaZeDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91I-NVaZeDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91I-NVaZeDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zOcxNtJ8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zOcxNtJ8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zOcxNtJ8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEDG3F5HAIVSHINNEPXCIVY42NEQ,1609686998710,1,True

2160,5.0,The mansion is sturdy and durable long lasting and worth every penny,"My girls ages 4 and 9 love everything about this mansion it really is over 4ft tall. As the mom 4”11 and it matches with my head as wide as my arms outstretched. This thing is a kids dream mansion for real. They have endless imagination. They play for hours nonstop. The mansion itself is very sturdy all the furniture pieces are hardwood as well I could see my girls playing with this for at least a good 5 years if not more because my little one has some years to grow into it. The 4 year old does have to stand on a step stool to play at the top level. All and all money well spent. My kids had a excellent Christmas thanks to amazon, kidkraft, and xcess limited. My husband wanted me to mention the the instructions and time frame of putting this mansion together. So on Christmas morning he started to unbox this beast around 11am ish and finished around 5pm ish. Over 100 pieces to put together like over 500 tiny screws to install the beast. A lot of file language was said putting this beast together a lot of frustration and prayer. I must add my husband is pretty good with following directions and good with his hands, but this beast worked his last nerve. The thing with him was every piece was numbered but the instructions were not helpful neither was the pictures. I had to go on YouTube and find videos of people putting this beast together. That was more helpful than what was given in the box. All and all we would buy this again and other kidkraft products because the final result makes it all so worth it. Plan ahead when preparing to put this kidkraft majestic mansion together.

2165,5.0,What a doll of a doll house,"This dollhouse was fabulous and my 5 year old loved it. It really brought back memories of when I had a doll house as a child. The furniture that comes with it is made out of wood, so it’s pretty sturdy and each room is a really nice size accompanied by a stylish design. Putting it together was the only challenge, which took my Papa doing and he stated it took hours due to the poor directions. Overall I’m really excited I purchased this for my daughter’s 5th birthday present. Nothing could have been better. We covered it with a sheet after assembly and surprise!!!

I am a father of 3 girls, and this is the best quality toy item in a long time!!!!! Well worth the price! Anyone can put this together, but I would sugest if you have some one that's handy, have them help. Just in case you come up with a problem like I had with a split piece of wood. Still a very high quality product at a reasonable price. And yes it is PERFECT size for barbies. Since I got this earlier today I have been thinking of writing a review, and I NEVER do. I say buy this house and make your girl happy!! One weird thing I found is that the elevator is not as tall as a floor so that's a lil weird, but I'm still SO happy.

2170,5.0,LOVE THIS BARBIE HOUSE!,"This is honestly the first review I have written for a product. We have had this dollhouse for almost 2 years and my girls (now ages 9 and 3) play with it everyday. Here are a few things we love about it:<br />1 - My two daughters and their friends have plenty of room for their Barbies. Each girl playing tends to make their own &#34;bedroom&#34; by using the sunroom, living room, bedroom, attic, etc.<br />2 - The furniture is still in great condition. They use the bed, couch and sunroom chair as beds everyday. The wood furniture is definitely better than plastic sets.<br />3 - The garage is fun to park Barbie scooters, snowboards, etc.<br /><br />The only con is the elevator. It is difficult to move up and down; however, my girls just move their Barbies up and down each level without it.<br /><br />Every adult that sees this Barbie house says it is amazing and all my girls' friends love playing with it as well. I guess the biggest reasons we love it so much is because it is sturdy, large enough for 4+ kids to play with it, and the furniture is well-made. Definitely worth the money!",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AESGPPQSFXHYQ55LF7X6LKCGD4WA,1431579085000,1,True

2175,4.0,"Real Nice, great value...meant to be used.","Having read some of the reviews, I was on both sides of the fence as to what I expected.  We were really happy with it.  It assembled nicely, all the holes lined up well and the instructions were fine.  They have no words...only pictures but pretty easy to follow.  The assembly IS A PROJECT. It isn't called for in the instructions, but I'd highly reccomend using some simple carpenters glue throughout the assembly.  I glued just about every single thing that touched something else...in addition to the screws/fastners that came with it and I ended up with a house that's built like a tank.  Total assembly time from opening box to play time was about 5 hours or so.  Maybe a coffee break or two was in there....but it's still a job better done.  Two hands would help at a few points....but I managed fine solo.  It makes a BIG...REALLY BIG IMPRESSION.  It's so big that it's just a thing of amazement to my 2 year old.  It's as tall as my mother (she's starting to shrink a bit) so she thought it was funny that it was taller than her.  All in all it is a BIG hit....and a great value for the price.  The furniture pieces that come with it are beautiful....all wood and painted really nice.  Says it accomodates a 12"" doll......which the ceiling height would allow.....but they'd look like giants based on the scale of the details and furniture.  Ideally you'd have dolls about 6-8""....but then again my daughter is using stuffed penguins and Yo Gabba Gabba charachters anyway!

It’s one of the first steps in the instructions, and after pulling everything out of the box and sorting the pieces, I was not willing to give up! So, I had to duct tape part of the elevator just so that my child would have her Santa gift Christmas morning. It was a let down, but I made it work. I’m extremely disappointed in this fact.

I had a friend help me put it together and started to finish from opening everything to actual completion took about 3 hours. The directions were simple and easy to understand.

I was super surprised to open it all and see everything and the detail was really nice. It’s sturdy once put together and does include anchors to prevent tipping over. The size is great and will provide for years of play through many stages. I have included some pictures of each room and the dollhouse as a whole.

The hardware is color coded to certain parts. Take a deep breath, take your time, and it will go together well. The directions are great, and your daughter (and her mother) will love this house!!

It is huge!  More like a furniture item.  My girls can not reach the top floor at this point! The furniture pieces are all wood too!  The elevator works great too!  This is a great item that I would recommend to anyone!  We paid one hundred and thirty dollars for it and I would have paid more.

Also wanted to say that Kid Kraft had extremely impressive customer service, we got a live voice right away when calling to report a few broken pieces.  They asked for our address, and said they'd have the parts delivered in about a week, and didn't ask us many questions at all.

Greased up the elevator with Vaseline, works great. Didn't use wood glue or wood filler anywhere, everything fit perfectly. We'll do an update after she's played with it for a while, but overall we are extremely impressed. The furniture is to die for, big and sturdy. Barbies fit perfectly.

Comes with 32 pieces of furniture that are of great quality (even better than expected)and adorable!<br />4. Fairly easy to assemble<br /><br />so, overall I was floored with this dollhouse and how much my daughter will love seeing this Christmas morning.<br />I also have a few suggestions that may help you when putting it together.<br /><br />1. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL CHRISTMAS NIGHT. Unless you want to be up until sun up.<br />2. Have 2 people. It took my husband and I both, just for holding and steadying purposes. Plus it was nice to have both of us screwing in the screws to save time.<br />3. Pay close attention to the directions. Use the picture on the box so you know which way is the floor and the ceiling on some steps because it wasn't too clear. The screws are painted so you can usually tell if your doing things right.<br />3.

It is well built and study for easy moving once assembled, we moved it from the play area at the front of our house to our daughters room at the back of our house with great ease. It is light enough that a single person could move it by themselves but for the sake of taking corners and doorways I suggest 2 people. It comes with wall anchors and instructions on how to install them. The accessories and furniture are well made and sturdy also. My daughter does not have a barbie car, she uses an army tank and I have not asked her if or how well the tank fits in the garage. I would have to say the only flaw that it has is, the panel that makes up the wall between the bedroom and shower, one side is printed upside-down. We chose to make the shower be the one that is upside-down when we put it together and as far as I know our daughter hasn't noticed.

My son took the box home and set it up the day before Christmas.  It took some time to assemble but he handled it with ease.  The dollhouse is truly spectacular.  You need a lot of room because it is so very large.  It is probably the single best gift I have ever bought her.<br />I was amazed to see how well the Barbies all fit in the house and the furniture is all wood and of great quality.  All her friends come over to play with her and<br />the Mansion.  I ordered the Majestic Dollhouse but Amazon sent me the Majestic Mansion because they had run out of the one I ordered.  When UPS delivered it the two men carried it into the house for me and my son picked it up for his home.<br />This is probably the best dollhouse I have ever seen.  It is bright, beautiful and sturdy.  My son read all the helpful hint reviews posted at Amazon and was able to assemble it in three hours.  His  only issue  was that the instructions were all pictures.  No written instructions.  Without all the extremely helpful reviews and hints from people who had built their dollhouses previously, he could have run into assembly problems.

2386,5.0,Great Dollhouse for any age,"I purchased this dollhouse after weeks of research online for my 5 year old and 2 year old daughters for Christmas.  I was hesitate after reading some reviews about the size and that the house furniture might be to small for Barbies.  The dollhouse took my husband and I 3 hours to assemble.  The instructions were great and all the parts were labeled.  It comes with the tools to assemble except for screw driver of course.  It is very durable.  The furniture is completely assembled except for the piano and the bed and those are very simple.  The house fits my daughters barbie dolls and the furniture is the perfect size for a 12"" doll.  They have played with it every hour possible since opening on Christmas day.  It is large so you will have to have an open area to place the house.  I do like the fact that you can put against the wall and play from the front.  There are wall anchors which I would suggest using if have any children 3 or younger.  My youngest has been caught trying to climb to 4th floor.  We keep a step stool next to it so they can reach.  I would suggest this dollhouse to anyone looking for something to last.  My daughter had wanted the Barbie Townhouse but with all the bad reviews I am so glad I got the Majestic Mansion instead.  It will last much longer and is not plastic.  The knob on the elvator came off after a couple of days but was fixed easily with wood glue.  My daughters will be able to use this dollhouse for many years as long as they are interested in dolls.

The first day my husband and I spent 3 hours working on it and the next day my son-in-law and I spent another 3 hours working on it.  Both my husband and my son-in-law are very handy people who do a lot of work around their respective homes.  The instructions are only in pictures, no words, to be appropriate for an international customer base and are sometimes difficult to interpret.  In the end there were some parts of the dollhouse that did not quite meet up and my son-in-law had to drill new holes; the original holes were off by about 1/8 of an inch.  Also, the staircase between the first and second floors did not fit well and kept falling out.  In the last 2 months my granddaughter broke a lot of the furniture and my husband has had to re-glue them back together.  My 18 month-old granddaughter also likes to play with it, especially when the older girl is in pre-school, so beware because the instructions warn about small parts that are not appropriate for children less than 3 years old.  After going through these initial difficulties we have a product that my granddaughter adores and she spends many happy hours playing with it - with her Barbie-type dolls. Would I buy it again?

This mainly happened when assembling the back.  Once completely assembled, it does feel pretty sturdy.  It isnt a piece that will be able to handle alot of moving around.

2428,5.0,"Sturdy, Easy, cute","The dollhouse was easy to assemble. It took me about 2.5 hours for most of it and an additional half hour on Christmas eve to do the last four bolts and anchor it to the wall. There are some small gaps at the roof line but overall goes together well. It's sturdy since my youngest has already scaled it to get to the top room and squeezed herself inside the second story without having anything come crashing down. It's cute with wooden pieces so I didn't have to scavenge around to town for bits and pieces to fill it in. It's big enough to minimize most sibling disputes too.<br /><br />Warning though, this thing is huge, taller than my kids, and takes up a large chunk of the wall. It's been an incredible success. We've moved the nursery stuff down to the third floor so the little one can reach it with a step stool. The only down side to it are the stairs which never really snapped into place so the kids can take them off and pretend the dolls slide down to the first floor. I got this on sale for under $150 so for me it was a great deal ofr the enjoyment my kids are getting from it.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AF7SKI4TPF6ZQKPKLHKFT633K3CQ,1356890701000,0,True

2432,5.0,"If you’re a father, read this","If I wrote this review during during the assembly process, I would’ve gave this 2 stars. Not because of the quality of the product, just because.. well.. dammit.. everyone is right when it comes to time prep.. I got this for my daughter’s Christmas gift for 2019 (she’s 4 now). Let me tell you.. it’s going to take a few hours.. I did it by myself and it took about 8 hours with a few breaks. But damn... the look on her face on Xmas morning.. and being that she’s playing with it everyday.. not just she... we are playing with it everyday. Which is awesome.<br /><br />Why we love it & why you should consider getting it:<br /><br />1. If you’re going to get a kid a doll house, get them this. Yeah there’s the smaller lol type ones.. but those come and go and honestly.. are cheap made. My kid has lol dolls.. but her favorite is the Barbie sized Elsa and the other princess ones..this product was a match made in heaven.. it not only comes with a bunch of accessories, it allows EVERYONE (types of dolls) to play. And the part I love the most.. how interactive each room (especially the elevator) is. If anything, it also allows the parents to get creative.. I went to ikea and got some led smart lights for like $10... boom.. each room lights up with a press of a button. I got a recorder message box for $2 on Amazon.. boom.. doorbell that plays any type of tune my daughter wants... except the “GET OUUUUTT” voice that the house in Adams family makes.. right now it’s that Elsa song from frozen 2.<br /><br />2. This thing is good in quality.. just make sure you literally tighten everything.. and check it 9 times as you continue to assemble. My daughter gets a little crazy with her dolls in the house at times.. and it’s holding well.<br /><br />3. Go big or go home guys. Yes this thing is massive, but like most of the people on here say, it’s worth it.. her room is 10X11 and tbh, it’s a great GREAT accent to it.<br /><br />Best money spent.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Youtube.. there’s this Asian couple who filmed their entire process of assembling the dollhouse.. whoever you two are.. thank you lol. Directions in all honesty are clear.. it just challenges you to be at your best when it comes to practical assembly. For me, everything was in the package, and labeled correctly.. the instructions assume that you have practical thinking..while I will say the instructions are just pictures.. and yes I had to re assemble some parts..but looking back at it.. I build (assembled) and epic doll house. You know that feeling once you assemble ikea furniture? You cuss while doing it, but you’re stoked once it’s done?

I absolutely love this dollhouse and read the reviews online before purchasing it. I wanted an alternative to the Barbie Dreamhouse and loved all the furniture and that the dollhouse is wooden. Well, today is Christmas Eve. We sent all 3 of our kids to Grandma's so we could put it together. My husband and I worked for hours to put it together, but something was wrong with the holes - they weren't lining up right. We were not able to put it together. Not only are we terribly frustrated that we wasted hours of our Christmas Eve working on it - but the worst part is that this was the main present for our daughter. Our daughter has been talking about Christmas for months and she wanted a &#34;Barbie Dreamhouse.&#34; By the time we realized that there was no possible way to get this put together, everything was closed. I've been thinking about giving her this dollhouse for weeks. I don't even think we can send it back b/c it is half put together. It would take us another hour to take it apart. I do think it was going to be the coolest dollhouse ever....but the machining just wasn't right and my husband is very good at putting things together...there was no way to make it work.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AG3A63J2EO3E2OILWCFEE5B6G3LQ,1514169074381,3,True

2523,5.0,Best Dollhouse EVER :),"We've had this dollhouse for 7 full months now and it gets payed with EVERY day. Within 2 months my 2 year old thought she would climb the stairs and cracked them (but they were still playable). I went to KidKraft's website to see how much it would be to replace them. I thought I would get an email with estimates...instead the stairs just showed up at my door a few days later - along with the wooden cake that was included with the furniture set - WE lost it (it was a family favorite) and I wanted to order another so I included it in my inquiry on their website.<br /><br />Bottom line: The dollhouse is FANTASTIC.

2537,3.0,My Villain origin story,"It was a day before my daughters birthday. A simple task to build this “ supposed“ easy build. Didn’t think much of it and assumed that it would take a hour at most. But for the community of Cadence Henderson it would almost become the last night of peace.<br /><br />It started the moment the Box was opened. Parts were in a mess that rivaled my local Wal mart. The instructions were as complicated as diffusing a nuclear bomb. Pieces that were supposed to have pre-drilled holes were in the wrong place that made you question your man hood. At one point when you think you could be like the great American War hero Angus`Mac' MacGyver, you was slapped across the face with despair and loneliness, because nothing was making sense while building this monstrosity. I will be reaching out to a lawyer because of the massive side effects this thing has on a person. You also gain the gift of tongues to swear in languages you never have learned. My sanity, my marriage, my fatherhood was all put on the line.<br /><br />Just when I thought I was about to quit a hero emerged from YouTube with the title labeled “How To Build KidKraft Majestic Mansion<br />Dollhouse: Step-by-Step Assembly Instructions.” Listen to her and follow her keen instructions. If it wasn’t for her I would have thrown this $135 Pandora‘s box into the depths of the Pacific Ocean. After I am done with his review, I will be calling the Vatican to make sure this lady gets her shang hood and capitol Hill for her to get a civilian medal of honor or something equivalent.<br /><br />Trying to rate this on if it is worth, it is like rating your levels of failures in life. But all in all it is worth it because my daughter loves this stupid house. The quality of parts is horrendous, the instructions was miserable, but the final product came out well. If I were to build this again, I would a hire a NASA engineer to build it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71V6aNNxPbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71V6aNNxPbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71V6aNNxPbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFTYGEX7OBYRXUB3LKCYASFEE5IA,1669487447756,40,True

Oh well, the price was good but the material ... trust me !,it is not that good, I was under the impression it was wood, not cardboard, the shipment said it was 63 lbs, but I was surprised when the thing didn't weight that much, oh well... lesson learned over here!, next time I will just build my own doll house from real wood.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFN75QWLL2LKRZKAWVMFGWO2DJZQ,1318504247000,18,True

I read a lot of reviews prior to putting it together and followed the advise of many and put petroleum jelly on the elevator and it glides easily now. The only problem I ran into was that one of the predrilled holes wasn't drilled far enough so the hubby drilled it a little and it worked . It took my about 3 hours to put it together. ( not because it was difficult, just because it was a lot of pieces. The furniture that comes with it is just so adorable ! It is big! That is one of the main reasons I got this dollhouse! My daughter gets easily frustrated with things falling over. Two of the furniture pieces ( one kitchen stool and the refridgerator were broken) again not a big problem because the next morning I called kidkraft and without big hassle the parts were on their way to my house.

It helps to print off an internet picture, no colored picture on the box. It took 2 hours to put it together but the dollhouse comes to my shoulder and I'm 5'5"".

I’ll list pros and cons so this will be quick:<br />Pro:<br />1. Comes with all furniture and everything you can imagine to put in a dollhouse<br />2. Fits Barbie dolls<br />3. Your child will be OBSESSED FOR HOURS<br />4. It’s sturdy so I imagine it’ll last long<br />5. SUPER tall, I have a pretty tall four year old and she’s just past the third floor. So she’ll definitely grow into it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Terrible instructions! I had to look up a YouTube assembly video just to get through most of the steps!<br />2. One of the floor pieces was installed wrong by the manufacturer. (See picture/video for reference). They drilled the holes for the stairs on the wrong side and I know it wasn’t my mistake because the stair railings fit perfectly in their holes. So it’s pretty annoying how the stairs are wobbly and can easily be moved!<br />3. Some of the wallpaper was already peeling but not too noticeably. Some edges seems a bit worn as well. Definitely a quality issue there.<br />4. If your kid isn’t too strong, the elevator may be a little difficult for them to push up and down alone.<br /><br />All in all: If you’re a military mom, or single mother, or just a mom in general you’re probably used to putting things together alone. A one person job took almost 4 1/2 hours with breaks in between so doing this on Christmas Eve felt like a nightmare.<br /><br />Great gift choice and I DEFINITELY do not regret it one bit!!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ONeqsCDSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ONeqsCDSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ONeqsCDSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DhLRM4rsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DhLRM4rsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DhLRM4rsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AHPB25FHIS2FOLJLBPFGQZQD6PVA,1577337949735,5,True

2792,5.0,Great buy!,"I have had my eye on this dollhouse for months and finally purchased last week when the price dropped to $152. I was a bit nervous as the outside box was pretty beat up and I could hear things rattling as the UPS man carried it up the stairs. I was pleased to find the actual product box damage free and all the pieces inside looked great despite being loose in the box. I used my vacuum to go over each piece as there were tiny styrofoam pieces all over.<br /><br />It took a couple of hours to assemble but I was able to do it on my own. I'm barely 5 ft tall and this dollhouse is almost as tall as me. The directions included pictures although you had to make sure you oriented the pieces as shown. All you need is a phillips head screwdriver and the included allen wrenches. The screws are color coded and labeled, although there are no extra screws.<br /><br />As soon as I had the house together, my girls put the included furnitue in the rooms and their barbie dolls started moving in. The Majestic Mansion Dollhouse comes with 35 pieces of furniture. The dolls fit great on the bed and at the piano but they are a little big for the bathtub. The babrie car and jeep that we have can go inside the garage but you can't close the doors. My girls are 7 1/2 and 4 years old and there is plenty of room for them to play side by side. Overall we are very pleased and hope this dollhouse will entertain our family for years to come.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEZS6WXRL4PQPKDQGWDKVCTBOP5A,1335743350000,1,True

The only recommendation I have is for the instructions to be in color because at times it was challenging to know which way to face some of the panels since they have print on both sides.,[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AEPHBZPQ22RCP2EM337DSZYLT3BQ,1389115113000,0,True

As far as kid's playhouses go, this thing is rock solid.  It also comes with wall tethers, so no risk of it toppling over.  I was surprised by how big it is.  It is huge!  It was purchased for my 7 year old, and it is taller than she is.  Also, my daughter was thrilled by all of the furniture and accessories.  Top notch quality playhouse.  I would recommend it to anybody.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AFPCXEMWWNL6IREP4HC65S24VIDA,1641088072595,0,True

My wife and I debated this product or the plastic Disney princess castle...I am happy with this decision.  It will last much longer.<br /><br />The one negative comment is that the assembly instructions lack detail.  Many walls and floors have decals...the instructions show none of these wallpapers...so extra time is spent figuring out which piece is which.  Assembly takes 2-3 hours.,[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGFLKTGVI25LGBZCGSSUYYWXW6EQ,1388413876000,0,True
2823,5.0,My daughter loves it.,"Came very nicely packaged inside a plain brown box.  Perfect for a surprise gift.  Took me about 2 hours to build it alone and taking my time.

Its heavy and big and hard to move once built.",[],B0042F99PG,B0042F99PG,AGL3AWN7LUGWFLJ7AOWLF5K5MNZQ,1366333088000,0,True

It is very sturdy and I hope it will last for many years. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the instructions are not helpful and it takes a long time to put together. It took 2 adults over 3 hours to assemble, and we had to google some instruction videos. I'm so glad we didn't wait until Christmas Eve to set it up. That would have been a very long night.
