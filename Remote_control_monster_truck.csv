0,5.0,Great RC  Truck for the Price,"This is a great RC truck for the price. Assembly is fast and easy. There is a break in period, that requires running it on a smooth flat surface.

6,2.0,You get what you pay for...,"I got this on sale for about $40, and it's probably worth every bit of that $40, but certainly not more.  It's fast-ish for a beginners RC unit, but it's pretty quirky.  By far the worst quirk is how reverse works.  Instead of pushing the trigger away from your palm like in every other RC vehicle made, you do a weird double pull of the trigger.  Then somehow this causes the vehicle to surge in reverse willy nilly until you crash into something.  It's just bizarre how it gets stuck in reverse...<br /><br />You can only charge on battery at a time, they use a super stiff connector that is almost impossible to connect, and the batteries *barely* fit into the truck itself.<br /><br />It's fine as a toy for a grown up, if you know what you are getting is a cheap RC vehicle.  But don't make the mistake of thinking this is in the same realm as a Traxxas or Kyosho or Tamiya RC vehicle - it's not even in the same realm.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHXJ7JLYLCBA2NKC6CEYPJ4AZEVQ,1664214819185,0,True

8,4.0,You get a lot for the price,"I got this RC truck for my 12 year old son. He loves it. The truck has great performance and is a good step towards getting a true hobbyist truck. It has two speeds, decent suspension, and lots of spare parts available from Prime. The batteries are physically small and you can fit two onboard. Each battery lasts longer than I would have guessed. The truck comes with some spare parts that I assume are the ones that break the most.<br /><br />These trucks are well built but they aren't hobbyist quality. If you crash these really hard you will break some pieces. My son bent a rear hub shaft and loses wheel nuts, but he has crashed it pretty hard. They are worth the price.

13,5.0,Best for beginners and children from 5yrs old all the way to adults (really!),"The ability to turn the power down for those learning came in great use when introducing my 5 year old to RC cars.  I wanted a car I could both he and I could get excited about.  For him, the car will grow with him with the ability to turn the power up to full when he's ready.  For me, it's fast enough to have fun with around a parking lot or in a field.<br /><br />For beginners (including adults) the power and center of gravity make the car really hard to lose control which I did not appreciate until I drove it and watched my son learn how to drive.  It's stable and a lot of fun to drive without a lot of frustration from needing to be a good driver.  It probably goes 20mph on the high setting which for it's size is plenty thrilling.<br /><br />The build quality is fine. Nothing has broken even though it's been dropped, crashed (into a wall by accident), flipped, cartwheeled - all of the things a beginner might accidentally do when learning.  Batteries last a long time and I like how simplistic the body is.<br /><br />I don't think this is actually a 1/10 scale.  I think it's a bit smaller which again I did not appreciate until we had some time playing with it.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AE6AEW3V7KABIVEO2MO26JP77KHA,1672619654957,1,True
14,5.0,Nice package for the money,"I think for what you get this package is a good value. The chassis is built well and is not a ""kids toy"" for sure. What I mean by that is you're getting a hobby grade car, although it's not the best of the best.<br />So far it's speed, maneuverability, and capability on most terrain is amazing at this price point. I've had it plowing through water in the gutters and thick grass without issue. My 8 year old son was able to drive it well on the low speed setting after about 10 minutes of playing with it. The cheapest feeling part of the package is the controller but it works well and offers a nice amount of control and adjustment.<br />I think most people looking for some casual r/c fun will be impressed by this package and more specifically the car itself.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AEVSQNCWL54TPPLPNEKFB4X27GYQ,1570973836729,0,False

22,2.0,Great when it works,"Update 10/5: Received amazon replacement, EXACT same thing happened. Only this time to two different wheels, not just one. Luckily I was able to find the locknuts this time. I tightened them, and we were driving it indoors on carpet on low speed and literally 3mph. The wheels fell off 3-4 different times. Even after I tightened them as much as I could, within reason of course! I sent it back and purchased an Arrma granite 4x4 brushed motor. I paid a tad more, but think it'll be worth it. Thank God for Amazons return policy. As Laegendary was initially unwilling to send me $0.30 locknuts after I told them Amazon sent me a replacement vehicle.... Really? Then they kept insisted I put crazy glue on the locknuts... I didn't buy a model car, I purchased an RC car.<br /><br />This truck is a little monster, it wheelies, peels out, kicks back anything under it, flies on short grass and handles long grass as well also. However!! During my first use, the rear wheel popped off while driving it. Keep in mind, this thing only saw flat roads and grass, I never took it ""off-roading"" or ""bashing."" I was VERY disappointed in that. I spent almost double on this than I did on any of my other trucks for my kids and it was the one that broke the fastest, actually the ONLY one that broke. I was in contact with the seller and they are going to send me a new locknut, but I'm not sure I trust the particular car I have. So, I have a useless $150 truck in my kids room, a very heavy and fat paperweight for now. That really bothers me.... According to all of the reviews on it, I might have just gotten a lemon. I am returning it for a replacement through Amazon. If it happens again, I will steer clear of this brand.

It sends rooster tails of wood chips and dirt. It is a blast.

First it is just so fast and agile. Second, if you go straight to this you'll miss out on experiencing the incredible increase in performance over what is typically your first RC car.<br /><br />All parts are replaceable.

33,5.0,Great RC truck for ages 8+,"Bought for my 8yo boy. First, just want to say he loves it. Definitely going to get some extra battery packs so he can use it longer although the original battery seems to charge in ~3h. My 6yo who is used to driving Walmart special RC’s can drive it but not well and hits things a lot in an open years/driveway even on low. Fast speed is FAST!! It’s shockingly fast. Makes ya go “huh” no way as you run out of sight!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-runs great in any terrain even high grass<br />-easy to start and go<br />-easy to steer and very responsive<br />-speed lever on the remote is variable throttle. Wasn’t sure when buying, but is definitely is which is great. Pull trigger half way and get half throttle. (6yo doesn’t grasp that but 8 yo can).<br />-fast but low speed isn’t “too fast”. 90% of the time my 8yo drives in L speed which saves battery juice but occasionally kick up to H and let it rip! Easily pops wheelies on H every time you hit the gas!<br />-seems very well made. Kids are rough on RC and I have no regret to buy for older kid use<br />-love the big size (they had similar Wallymart size)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-not sure pro/con…battery lasts about 45 mins when using low speed and 2 batteries together. Wish it were more, could be less I guess but that on par with the post so I won’t take stars off.<br />-the 2-battery connector provided is nearly impossible to get tucked in with the batteries and get the cover on. It can be done but takes way too much playing , wiggling, take out and repositioning again.<br />-Flimsy body and pins holding it on. Anticipate that will be the point of toy failure for daily kid use<br />-gets super hot on the entire bottom when using.<br />-owner’s manual isn’t too helpful. First time batteries were low it blinked the cars LED blue rapidly. Wasn’t sure if that was a malfunction, overheat (since first time and it was super hot) or what. Read in the Amazon Q/A section that means “low battery” AKa normal operation. The manual didn’t even mention it.<br />-sort of ugly paint job. More color/body options would be nice.<br /><br />Price was a tad more than some others, but I found a nice review online comparing/contrasting various name brands and of those in the review Legendary was by far the best. Seeing that I figured if $20 extra gets a better product it will be worth it. We’ll see. I found probably 15+ different options within the price range $100-150.

We bought this for a son who saw his older brothers experience disappointment after disappointment with many problems, easy breakage, slow moving, complicated operation, battery's dying way too easily, and then it's taking 10 batteries out of each unit, charging them, putting them all back, and so on and so on and so on, with former purchases and other radio control cars.  Needless to say, he actually asked me NOT to get him a remote control car,(even though he'd love on that works and lasts) because, of all of the broken and lame cars we have seen before.  This car, however, changed him.  He's 13, and usually I have to coax him out of bed..  This morning, he was up and ready to play with this car!  He has thanked me over and over, and is so delighted about everything on this racing legend.  It is easy to operate, excepting perhaps the controller that he says, has a bit of play, but, other then that, everything looks great, and I appreciate how happy he is.  It literally zooms(super fast, in my sons own words), smoothly everywhere, battery removal is way easy, charging batteries is simple, Thank you.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AEL3UZRQXY7RLNBOYZFH7AZ36XEA,1578421255346,2,True

When this happens it just keeps going no matter what you do with the throttle and the only way to stop the vehicle is to turn off the remote.  This is not a one-time incident with just my kids etc.  This happens almost anytime someone tries to give the throttle 100% from a dead stop.

137,4.0,"Fun RC, but I wish I knew then what I know now","I wanted to wait to give an honest review on this product.  Our kids got into RCs this past summer (2020) and I didn't know squat about them.  Did some research for a few days and my son wanted to buy his own RC.  He had the money to buy a Traxxas or Arrma, but we didn't want him to spend that much of his own money.  He bought the Laegendary Monster Truck.  He had it 2 weeks and the rear diff cup broke.  I ordered the upgraded diff and drive shaft.  Thankfully found a video that showed how to replace that and boy what a pain that was.  Lots of screws.  LOTS.  To get to the rear diff and even more to replace the drive shaft.  Those weren't too expensive, but knowing what I know now looking at the price of parts for the truck.  They are very expensive if you have start replacing screws or drive shafts and other various parts.  This is a hobby grade RC.  There is maintenance involved and things are going to break eventually.  The truck's front diff is currently broken.  By the way the differential cups break on these very easy.  It's a common thing with the plastic differentials that come in these trucks.  I guess that is why they sell the upgraded metal ones.  I have the diff here.  I just dread taking the entire truck apart to fix it.<br /><br />Two weeks later my daughter bought a Traxxas Slash 2WD.  Yes it was a bit more ($220), but I couldn't believe the simplicity of the truck.  Everything was so easy to get to and work on.  Parts are abundant and cheap.  I've only had to replace a hear axle hub.  $4 for a pair from RPM (great aftermarket parts for RCs) that is all.<br /><br />This January 2021 my son, for his birthday, got the Arrma Big Rock Crew Cab to replace the Laegendary Monster Truck (which is mine now).  This is another brand that is simple to work on.  For comparison it takes 4 screws to access the front diff and 4 screws to access the rear diff. Very simple design.<br /><br />I'm not trying to knock on Laegendary.  I had lots of questions after we got the truck and they would always answer within a day through email.  There are a lot of people that enjoy this truck.  It is a fun truck to play with.  It goes through just about any terrain with ease and is pretty fast for a brushed RC Truck.  I'm part of a Facebook Group for Laegendary and will get this one up and running at some point.<br /><br /> I just want people to know there are reasons Arrma, Traxxas, Redcat, Axial, etc. cost more and not just paying for a name.  You have part availability, maintenance, aftermarket parts, hop ups, and most of all (for me) easy access to everything for maintenance.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHDD6PSEYYUXMBCF4IJYFG3STHKQ,1611804576557,2,True

Make sure you tighten the front wheels when you get it. I have two of these and for some reason they come with loose front wheels. Not a big deal you'll just end up with two wheel drive and eventually a wheel will fall off. One downfall is any replacement parts have to come from the company.

Laegendary RC's are not a ""toy"" you'd find at Walmart, but aren't insanely priced enthusiast level models either. It's a real RC truck with real suspension, real capability, and they take a beating with replacement parts available if you do crash them hard or wear components out. I'll list my small complaints, though none are worth a star deduction.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+All-in-one kit, plug 'n play<br />+Solid construction<br />+Good customer service/support<br />+Replacement parts and components available (see manual)<br />+Comes with some replacement parts (wheel nuts, body pins, etc)<br />+30MPH high speed<br />+Good controller/transmitter<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Two charging cables, but only one charger (most phone USB chargers work though)<br />-Both batteries in the truck is a tricky squeeze, but doable (increases run-time, but you can also just swap out batteries rather than run both)<br />-LiPo batteries require special care and storage, but the charger doesn't have a volt meter or ""storage charge"" ability nor are there instructions on storage. Digging into the manuals, it appears the truck shuts down when the batteries hit 3.8 volts, well above the 3 volt minimum to keep LiPo's healthy when stored. So you should probably run the truck until dead, then store the drained batteries in their pouch until next use because storing fully charged or under charged (3V) LiPo batteries can degrade or even damage the cells. This is a bit of a hassle as having batteries ready to go and always charged is ideal, but it's only a 60-90 minute charge time.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase, and my son is thrilled. Would definitely buy again... or buy another Laegendary model for myself, lol. If you want more speed (40MPH vs 30) and longevity, Laegendary makes an upgraded brushless motor version of this truck called Thunder. If you want a bigger 1:8 scale truck, opt for their Nitro or Rango models.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHWTNTH42P3AHBPICP3ZSJLPVBGA,1661360458924,0,False

185,5.0,Well worth the money for several reasons.,"I bought this for my 8 year old son and he absolutely loves it. The low speed mode is a big help with training and it still moves very well. After 2 days of driving, he whips it around over the driveway, grass and gravel. One of the great features, I feel, is the sealed compartment. I owned probably a dozen RC vehicles and my biggest gripe was cleaning them out. I wiped his off a little and it looks great again. The double battery definitely helps in the runtime area. He gets a good 40+ mins of run time. The only downside I see is the long charge periods, but that can easily be overcome with extra batteries and also helps them live longer. So maybe it is not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />Overall, I like the quality of the vehicle. The shocks are oil filled and there are ball bearings throughout. Of course, it is not as easily upgradable as the Traxxas or other brands models, but if you are looking for something simple, rugged and fun for your young kids to introduce them to the hobby, it is a great entry point. I can't wait to see his face when I put it on high speed mode. Try not to get caught up in the hype of top speed numbers from any of the RC vehicles. The enjoyment your child has driving it will be the greatest reward.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LTvC-7xiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LTvC-7xiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LTvC-7xiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AFYKOII2FH2MJA7R57U7EKXDPWYQ,1589295580731,1,True

They were fast, this one not so. im not sure if you can use 3s or 4s batts if so then ill be wrong. 390 cans are small motors compared to 540, but 2 sounded like a great mix.<br />So i did an inspection of the truck and it is well sealed, i even tightened up the important nuts, after passing my checklist and making sure the batteries are good , me and the boys set off for our little adventure at the park. We decided to do rings around the baseball field, and my sons drove it on the slow speed setting , this to them was a bit fast but overall he did a good job. Then after 10 min, i switched it on to the fast setting. Within a lap the truck sank to its front and dragged itself before stopping , the left wheel had flown off and the nut vanished. so i checked to see what was needed to make this a RC car again. So what was a perturbing to me was the part attaching itself to the rims were plastic that made a cross sign so the rims can fit tight and square on it. Now that should be metal and not plastic. I do see that to be a problem area for this type of RC truck. MY entire driving experience was 12 min. before a catastrophic failure occured. I dont see myself keeping it .",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AH52NOGKLRREQ67Z2X4NBHA5OGXA,1598008784685,3,True

219,5.0,superfun!!,"I actually got this for my 46 year old son's birthday - but I have played with it also.  We have 5 acres and I built a trackk with obstacles, a rock hill, jump, banked curve, etc.  He was shocked by the car and equally shocked by the track.  What fun we've had.  After the track we ran it in our field and up and down a rocy ravine - more fun.  Our little donkey wasn't a huge fan as he didn't know what to make of this thing.  He ran from across the field up to me and nuzzled his head against me.  This may be the new way to round up animals and get them back to the corral at night.  More track is planned and offroad racing.  Great fun - highly recommend.  Vern Miller",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AGKVNKUK6SFCVCHX2ZOCLG6XXZ7A,1555905026778,1,True

229,1.0,"Can't use, doesn't pair with remote","[[VIDEOID:1bd237668d7799ef2c82570f8cbb974f]] We purchased this as a gift for my son, but after opening it and charging the batteries, it doesn't pair with the remote. The LED on the RC truck just flashes. We reached out to customer service and they had us open the remote to check that everything inside was plugged in. It was. They asked us to send a video of the problem. After sending that, they sent information, which we already had in the manual, about keeping it away from large metal objects. They finally agreed to send a replacement remote so that's on its way. However, from other videos we've watched, the headlight kit that came with the truck should turn on when you turn on the battery, but that isn't happening. When I told that to customer support, they sent back a response to explain how the LED lights flash when pairing, so not what I was explaining. Then after I replied, they sent a video about how to install LED lights on an RC vehicle, but it was a generic video by some RC hobbyists, not specific to the truck that came with a light kit without needing tools and such. Basically, my customer support experience has not been very helpful. If the remote arrives and is able to pair, then I will update my review.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AECAPX47RWPF5XXAJTX5HI4V7F7A,1669216576926,4,True

He's gonna order more batteries in the future. But the car is good, durable, runs like crazy and is a great entertainer for the ones who like this kind of hobbies.

237,1.0,Fun......... when it worked.,"[[VIDEOID:4c3fedd777d1fa7db702ebcae45e733]] I have had problems from the beginning. The controller would not bind with the car on occasions. It didn't always happen, but it happened enough and it always took hours of turning them both off and on for it to finally get it work again. Sometimes I would give up and wait a day or two. I contacted Laegendary by email and they were awesome and very responsive. They had me send a video in of my issue. They told be the issue is the ESC LG-ZJ07 which is the receiver on the RC car. They sent me a new one with instructions on how to install it. I had to take the car apart and solder the receiver to the motors. It was a pain to do, but it worked for a little while, but now I have the same problem except this time it does bind all. I can't use the car at all. I contacted Laegendary again and sent them a video and they said it's the controller or ESC LG-ZJ07 and to buy another one. That sucks. I feel like I should have been able to get the whole thing replaced from the beginning because I had the issue from day one and shouldn't have to repair it myself. I should have spent a little more money and had gotten a better brand hobby car.

277,4.0,Great RC truck!,"Wanted to wait to write a review until we had used it a bit.<br /><br />First, it's a great RC Truck. As described and performs as described. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />Customer service: This deserves 10 stars. The best I've encountered on Amazon aside from Amazon itself. They responded within hours, not days, and even contacted me to make sure I received it. Due to some reading as delivered, but never delivered. Delivery not what it used to be. Arm yourself with a front porch camera.<br /><br />Overall: Really great. Everything as described. Very pleased.<br /><br />Battery: Two come with it and the truck can hold one or two. We use two for over 40 minutes of run time. Charge time is about 90 minutes.<br /><br />Durability: This is the cause for 4 stars. Now, no doubt it's held up very well being used by my 14 year old son. But it's important to know you'll be replacing parts. They're all available on Amazon and the owners manual has all of there part numbers.<br />I've replaced and/or will be replacing:<br />Front Bumper Block<br />Front Lower Arm<br />Tires<br />Arm Connector Set<br />And I ordered 100 replacement pins. They come out every outing. I'll be ordering an additional cover at some point also. It takes a beating.<br />The front end steering is getting off. Doesn't turn right great. I'll be taking apart to have a look.<br />I ordered an RC car repair tool kit as well.<br /><br />All in all though, really great. I'd order another from Laegndary. But they have limited options. Will order another Hosim though. Don't need to pay for a Traxxas.

I had the Hosim version of this, but a car ran that one over 3 days after Christmas.  When I went to replace it, found this Laegendary one on a Deal of the Day.  Glad I stepped up to this one, because I can definitely tell some difference with the shocks, but I love the dual battery option and the lights have added a whole other layer of fun.  I can't speak to how long it's going to last, but we've already put at least 8 driving hours on this, and it's still running perfectly.

The vehicle had many good reviews and well written comments. I wasn't disappointed with what I received. I haven't had the chance to use it outside yet, but inside I have no problem driving it quite slowly (To play with my cat) My Dog appears quite leery of it. A couple times I accelerated hard just to see what it would do,and it's really fast. In 'H' or high speed mode, it is way to fast to use in the house. There is a bit of hesitation when switching to reverse, I have to hit the trigger twice to get it to go into reverse if it's already going forward.

316,3.0,"It works, but...","I bought this RC truck as an exercise aide for my dog, Kona. She loves to chase after it and run along with it so she gets as much exercise as the limited battery life allows. So as far as meeting my expectations it does a good job.<br /><br />However battery life is disappointing. I'd estimate that with two fully charged batteries we get, at best, 20 minutes of play time. Now it is wintertime and the temperatures outside are cool so we can expect reduced battery performance relative to summertime temperatures. But I haven't had the truck during a summer yet so I have no real basis for comparison. As a result, battery charge lifetime does not meet my expectations.<br /><br />We run the truck on both asphalt pavement and park grass. It does pick up a lot of grass clippings from the lawn and they get wrapped around the axles and into the wheels so clean-up takes a while. I'm also starting to hear a ""grinding"" sound that suggests that dirt or something else has worked its way into the mechanical part of the car. I'll have to open it up to see what I find.<br /><br />Overall we are enjoying using the truck.

366,1.0,Broke two of them less than 30 minutes of using,"Bought one with high hopes as a Xmas present for my son. After using it for 30 minutes the front axel broke. Got an instant replacement (thank you Amazon) and the second did exactly the same thing except this time it was a rear wheel.<br /><br />The car itself is highly regarded and has good overall reviews, but my experience was extremely disappointing. The car feels well built and seems like it should withstand more abuse without breaking. We were not doing anything abnormal with it. The car has a mixture of some metal and plastic parts, and sadly the plastic parts did not withstand being run more than 30 minutes before failing where the wheels take stress. One they snap or break it causes other areas to fall apart and the metal axels to fall out (see pictures). Also, the front part of the vehicle completely snapped loose from the chassis. I would suggest sticking with recommended bashers in this price range like a mjx hyper go rc or a slight step up in durability (and price) with a traxxas entry model.

The battery will stop immediately when there is not enough power from it, no degradation of power then stoppage.

The battery life of the both batteries together I would say last for about 30 minutes run time. I've bought bigger batteries that can fit inside of it so I can last up to an hour. The range in the RC car is really good. If picks up my RC car easily throughout any  Length I put it on. Not gonna lie of also use this for Halloween during the coronavirus put a bowl of candy in the back of it and delivered that kids sud be free of interaction. And those able to stand the weight of the candy bowl in the back and lasted With the extra help of the 2 batteries I bought the whole entire time for Halloween.<br /> I wish the remote was a little better.

Having two batteries is great because the batteries only last about 15 mins. This rc car also is very tough. He has driven it in snow, dirt, grass, and gravel and this thing moves through it all. This rc car has taken a beating with crashes and flips. It is just a beast. The only thing I would complain about so far would be that there is only two other covers for this rc car.

If you take it to the RC race track on Ram Off Road Way in Colorado Springs, the batter will last about 15 minutes running it hard. I also purchased a third battery when I purchase it so my son is using three batteries, which seems to work out great. In the snow the batteries last about 10 minutes because it has to work so hard against the snow, but it is fast. If you kid has never had an RC car, this is NOT the car for him to start with.

I would do business with them again based on this experience.<br /><br />Update: on a recurrence of the issue they were kind enough to send me a video illustrating how to disassemble the vehicle to resolve the problem without damaging it.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT FOR INDOOR PLAY, it's much too fast and powerful for that, even at low speed (unless you live in an aircraft hangar).

Thus in this kit, you also get a FIREPROOF  ""battery bag"" included for safely storing your li-po batteries when not running the vehicle.<br /><br />The only thing not included is 3 AA batteries to power the controller.<br /><br />A nice added feature is this truck includes REAL LED running lights! The truck looks super-cool w/o the lights but WITH the lights it elevates the beauty of this beast to a new level. The lights are easy to install; just pop the lights into place and plug in the wire into the dedicated power slot provided; done!<br /><br />The control is responsive, yet easy to master even for beginners. HINT: start out on the 'half speed' setting until you get used to it. Also, be sure to trim the steering so it goes straight when your hand is off the steering wheel (there's a ""steering trim"" knob right on the controller so this is easy to do!).<br /><br />This truck is also RUGGED...I really put a beating on it and it held together nicely! The shocks come pre oiled and are top quality.<br /><br />This truck takes TWO 7.4V 1600mAh Li-Po batteries (included) so you have plenty of power to crank those two engines. With two engines being powered, I was expecting a short (maybe 20 min) of play time but was pleasantly surprised to get DOUBLE that at 40 minutes it was still going strong!<br /><br />One final thing... Laegendary's support is awesome!... I emailed them that my truck lights didn't seem to work and they wrote me back within hours with the solution (turned out I had the lights plugged in backwards; unplug, reverse, plug in...Wow, Lights!)

It's very quick, the range of the remote of operation is very, very good, there were very minimum settings changes necessary for the remote to the vehicle, the Hi to Lo speed adjustment is necessary to allow the operator to become accustomed to the vehicle. Personally, as a grandfather giving this vehicle/toy to my 8-year-old great-grandson was a very difficult decision. This vehicle isn't suitable for any child of lesser age unless there will be an older or more mature individual present the operation may result in a pleasurable experience for the actual user.<br />The only cons I can possibly consider would be, !. longer battery life., 2.

The difference in quality between this truck and the other vehicle purchased at similar price is huge. The chassis construction is solid, with everything sealed and covered. Performance is fantastic. fast and durable. Already ran it into a mailbox post by accident and no damage. Obviously results there will vary.... Jumping it is the norm with my kids.

But I paid $120 for it and I wish I would have paid $99 or less. It will do wheelies uphill but feels light when driving like it wants to float constantly.<br /><br />Overall I’d give it a 3/10 rating and only because it seems well built and I still have fun with it but I would much rather have spent another $100 and went with the aarma 4x4 1/10 truck.,[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHZ5VSZSRZ7J55NT36THWTCUNJ4A,1657740127230,0,True

My son likes it, which is all that really matters.<br />However, we've driven it probably 6-10 times and have already broken the steering servo, a shock popped it seal, and the front steering cup ball joint wore out and required replacement. Granted we may drive ever so slightly harder than others, but you really can't get too crazy with this car, so I would have expected the parts to last a lot longer than that. FWIW, all of those parts I mentioned are the same as another brand and a few bucks cheaper (if you search the part number the other brand will also show up with similar numbers).<br />The transmitter has a nice feel and is responsive, but on occasion the receiver goes haywire on startup and the car wants to drive itself, so make sure you're holding it on power up (yes, my transmitter is always turned on first, it still freaks out sometimes).<br />Also, I was replacing the tire and over-tightened the nut in the cvd drive shaft, which snapped shaft. I honestly wasn't putting much force on it, but apparently that was too much, so I replaced that as well.<br />Overall the car drives pretty well. I wouldn't call it crazy fast by any means, but faster than a cheapo $20-$50 car for sure. I probably wouldn't buy it again, I would much rather pay a little more and get a name-brand lower end car like a rustler, but I'm not disappointed in this purchase either.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AF6RONDWIYQAEKJZEINNBFZ6W62A,1615269795439,0,False

Which 12 days later I have yet to receive from Amazon.Com. Not sure what the hold up is. Can't find a phone number or e-mail address to contact them.<br />I had also bought 4 extra batteries that I never used so I sent them back also with no problems. I liked the car, when it runs. Good traction on dirt and sand. Fast on hard surface. Didn't try to do jumps with it. Great beginners car. It has a low and high speed which is good to learn on  driving for the first time.Not sure how easy it is to get parts, worth checking out. Not sure if it can be upgraded to run faster. I would buy the insurance - not sure what it covers, probably worth looking into. Seems well built, good skid plates underneath. I might suggest installing a stronger servo motor. Probably why mine broke. Not that expensive and probably a YouTube video would show you how to replace it. I was going to mount my GoPro Hero7 Black camera on the hood of the car, and also inside the car, but unfortunately never got the chance. I have a 3-axis gimbal that I was also going to mount on the car for the GoPro to get some super stable POV shots but I will try out that set up when I get my new car. I have ordered a Redcat Shredder. I decided to pay a little more money and get a better built car. Redcat has every replacement part with numbers and pictures for all their cars plus they tell you just how to upgrade your EMC, shocks, motor, battery upgrades, charging systems,servo,and gears etc, for faster and better performance and handling.. https://www.amazon.com/Redcat-Racing-Shredder-Electric-Truck/dp/B073SZJMNF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=redcat+shredder&qid=1598382861&sr=8-1<br />You can download both the Shredder and Laegenday car manuals and this is a good way to compare the two cars. I'm new to RC so this is what I have learned just in the last 6 weeks. I have joined a few R/C car forums that have good info on maintaining you car and answering all your questions. Great sport. You can join a racing club nearby or just have tons of fun driving it with your friends.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AFYX4UCZPOH5JXPRC7R43ZW3ERIA,1598383182200,3,True

590,5.0,100% Pretty Impressive 👏,"UPDATE 1/7/2020::<br />Well my son tried to do some kind of Fast & Furious stunt maneuver under a REAL moving car.... The real car won but I have to applaud the design of this RC model. With it having been run over by a car. The body didn't get crushed! Seriously!! I figured it would be a total loss but nope. It needs new tires and 1 shock. That's it!! It still turns on and ran, well... It wobbled away but that's some super serious heavy duty stuff it's made of!!<br />What's even better?  They sell parts for the RC's.<br />Right On 👊<br />----------------------<br />11/2020<br />My 11yr old saved his allowance for this specific RC truck. His hobby has been playing with RC's for years now and he wanted one that was faster than what he currently has. Turns out that this LEGENDARY RC Truck is pretty darn fast!!  Other people have said its the fastest they've seen for battery operated RC car.<br />Also, this RC has a solid under carriage. Its not made of plastic like I've seen on other brands. And its got some weight to it too. I'm not exactly sure what its made of but its not plastic.<br />It also has lights but he hasn't quite figured out how to turn them on 🤷‍♀️<br />So I'd have to say that you can't go wrong with is one. 👍<br />Also, side note... I gave it 3 stars for beginners because you have to really know how to use the controller for one as fast as this. Because of its speed and if you're not used to this type of remote, you might crash this one. Kinda like I did into the garage door - which left a dent 🤦‍♀️","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JQHWU7rwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JQHWU7rwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JQHWU7rwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91o9SPJwlhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91o9SPJwlhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91o9SPJwlhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91x1O-98xNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91x1O-98xNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91x1O-98xNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1o+QeX+-1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1o+QeX+-1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1o+QeX+-1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ou5U0QtQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ou5U0QtQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ou5U0QtQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AGNP6WKABDB3V7UWMEMUWJNWY2CQ,1605681652371,3,True

Nothing was broken, and everything was perfectly packaged. We opened it up and immediately charged the batteries. Took about 2 hours to charge 1 battery, and he's been playing with it ever since.

I removed 1 set because it was too stiff on the rear, but it was super easy to do.<br />The LED lights are super cool.<br />This is now the newer model and even comes with a large enough battery compartment to hold both batteries and has 2 little locks to hold it on. It used to require a strap to hold them both on.<br />It also has a newer style push push on off switch, which I had heard was a bad thing on the older model.<br />My only trouble is that the batteries take way too long to recharge, like 2 hours or more.

They agreed to help with the replacements but I had to pay half the cost of the new shocks when the issues were not caused or influenced by myself.  So me as the customer had to pay for the company's mistake...  I was not very happy about that.<br /><br />Overall I think the car is great and I understand quality issues happen but I am not happy that I had to pay for replacing parts that were received defective.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHVUJHPJ2QFRDGKX2EZH4VTUIMYA,1578277365712,1,False
737,5.0,First RC driving vehicle and it's a winner (so far),"Had been eyeing this for a while as it looked like the best sub high-end option and the reviews didn't seem fake, also very impressed with the company's responses to questions and problems. I'd forgotten about this thing and wasn't specifically  looking but came across it somehow for 20% off on Prime Day (I'm sure Jeff Bezos reminded me that I needed it). I'm glad he did because he was right, I totally needed it. Had it out in 4-5 inch high grass and it's truly awesome. I started on half-speed which is a brilliant option (maybe they all have this) and off it went at maybe 8-10 MPH. I saw something shoot up in the air on a tight turn and my hopes were dashed with me thinking something had broken and flown off...but it was just leaves and assorted lawn stuff getting shot up in the air from the force of the tires...on slow speed. On high speed we were at around 16-18 mph and it was awesome. With low cut grass it would probably get to 25 mph (tried this the next day, probably got to around 20)...without a huge yard you may not want it to get much faster. Response seemed very good and reverse had it powering out of a few garden beds with ease. I drove it slowly into a soccer ball to get my dog's attention and at slow speeds it seems like a climbing monster...it actually climbed over the ball...I think that's called torque and this thing must have that in spades. Range was impressive, I've got 100 yards and had it out about 70 so far with no issues.<br /><br />At any rate, like I said I've never used one of these before, so I can't compare it to anything. My guess is that I chose correctly  and anything else would be a letdown. My only regret is that I didn't buy two on Prime Day, though to me it is easily worth the the $160 or so regular price. Racing and smashing two of these together would be super cool; also, though it says '14 and older' on the box, it's simple to drive and a 7 year old should have no problem handling it...just start on slow mode.<br /><br />One thing: Upon turning the truck on it sometimes gets stuck on a and races away. I think its because you need to turn the car on before the receiver, or vice versa. This caused it to smash into a table and knock over and break a pot. Apparently it hit the metal table at full speed and there wasn't a scratch on the truck or even the shell that I could see.<br /><br />Well done, Laegendary, whoever you are.<br /><br />Update: reached out to Laegendary regarding the throttle issue; they were incredibly responsive and have shipped out a new controller. I think this is a rebranded Hosim as they look exactly the same but with a few upgrades. Hosim has now come out with a similar upgraded unit. Regardless , if that's the case the key differentiater is service, and this company has really shown brightly in that regard, though they are a young company, so you never know what the future holds. For the non-rabid enthusiast, I don't see how this can be beat, especially if you can grab one during a sale.<br /><br />Seller communication has been great, just received my free bag of shell clips. Again, I can't see how a $300-$500 'hobby grade' model could add any more value. Looking forward to trying it in the snow and hoping for a brushless version.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AGLFF3RIBWTOVMEU7ICBKNQI3MLQ,1563641683391,142,True

763,5.0,"Good RC entry choice. Way too fast for indoors, outdoors is a blast!!!","This little truck runs very fast. The remote has a good range, takes your car as far as you can barely see it to maneuver it back. The combination of tires and suspensions makes it easy to be controlled on rough terrain. However, it can be flipped easily, if that happens you will need to reset it by hand. (Can’t somebody design a spring arm to automatically engage when the car it’s on it's back, to kick it over?!)<br />The battery connector is short and awkward  to align with the pack to set everything in the compartment for the cover to fit over. It’s even more of a challenge for the same reason to figure out a way to align two packs to strap to the body of the car. And of course the battery cover can’t be used with two packs.<br />The switch to turn the car on and off is impossible to reach without removing the car's shell. At first I thought it to be a drawback. But considering the fact that you need to remove it anyway to put fresh packs in, it doesn’t matter anymore.<br />Putting back the pins takes a bit of getting used to. A small plier may come in handy. For little fingers is less of a challenge.<br />I have purchased two cars at the same time so my kids can race each other. They are happy and enjoy them a lot. I had to tape one car and the controller with masking tape to differentiate between the two. It would be nice if LAEGENDARY would produce two different shells for the same car, to help with distinguishing between them in my case (and maybe others, I don’t know?!).<br />The purchase happened a week ago.

783,5.0,Worth the money for entry level hobby.,"This thing is incredible. Fast, rugged and sensitive. Bought this as a “father/son” hobby. We broke it out of the package this morning and could hardly wait for the batteries to charge.<br /><br />Once charged, we immediately got to ripping around the yard and terrorizing the dogs. If my sons head wasn’t attached, it would have fallen off as he was laughing so hard. Even at eight years old, he was able to maneuver and master this quickly.<br /><br />We have some concerns: you must be an engineer to manage to get two batteries connected inside the battery compartment at the same time. Clearly I’m far from being an engineer as I spent the better part of 10 minutes trying to manage this. After 10 minutes, we just put one battery in and started playing.<br /><br />The battery charger seems pretty basic. Based on a lot of the battery reviews, we’ll likely upgrade the charger (it’s no more than a cable and a USB wall plug) to an actual hobby level charger.<br /><br />The cotter pins that hold the body on are difficult but manageable. Not something my son can do without a tool.<br /><br />First impressions are tough to beat. And this thing has truly won both of us. Both batteries lasted about 20+ minutes at half power through a mix of grass, leaves and some crusted snow.

It's a lot of fun to drive and the fact that it's 4-wheel drive means it can get itself out of a lot of the binds that driving in the back yard can cause.

That way, the driving time increases. I can't stress how fun it is to actually drive this car... it's really quick, sharp and responsive steering, and plenty of power to jump over obstacles and pull impressive high-speed turns.

It is surprisingly fast and easy to control with a little practice.  Range is good and the truck can get out of most jams unless it gets high centered or flips on it's back.  Really well balanced for drifting and a lot of fun out in the yard, on driveway, gravel, etc.  I've ordered two more batteries and extra charger so we can have more run time.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is the steering doesn't stay centered.  When you adjust it, it tends to drift slightly right or left.  This is not a big deal but would be nice when at top speed on a straight away to not have to nudge it back and forth.  I've also replaced the power switch once already in first month (comes with a spare) and ordered a new one from the OEM website.  Seems to get sand and dust in it and becomes hard to move the switch so the plastic slider breaks off.  A switch cover would be an improvement that is easy to make.  We've also lost most of the body clips.  When the truck flips, the clips get pulled out somehow.

Another downside is replacement parts, a spring on a shock already fell off after 2 uses and Amazon customer service sent me the wrong part twice and ultimately I had to pay extra for the correct part in another brand (Hosim).

One was a result of turning on the controller and the car taking off without touching the trigger.<br /><br />Overall I spent more time repair and putting exta $$ into this vehicle.

I came across this RC truck and was skeptical of buying another ""professional"" truck especially since this one was twice the price. Well, I have to say that I was very pleased with the product. This truck is built well, heavy, and plenty of power. All of the issues I had with the other brand truck are non-existent. Spend the money and buy this truck.

911,3.0,"Buyer beware... ball joint and differential  issues, three stars now..","Another update for January 1st, 2020.  I had to replace both differentials and the driveshaft to get the car back into working condition.  Take careful note of the scarcity of parts for the truck. I had to buy off of eBay to find the parts. The washer hack for the lower ball joints did work. So far my son has put about 40 hours on the truck.  Avoid running it in sand or water, it will pre-maturely wear the components out and cause the switch to bind.<br /><br />This my second review.  Also my 2nd truck... the first was returned within 30 days as the lower front ball joints start to pop after several hours of moderate use. Customer service was a huge disappointment in that they were dragging a resolution in spite of sending them pictures... which I added below.. The second truck has started popping ball joints again but Im going to try the 3mm flat washer fix mentioned in the comments. Its fun when it works but now it breaks down too quickly. Update 10/20/19. The washer hack worked like a charm no more popped ball joints.  Latest issue is the rear differential is blown out so the car has lost half its drive power to the wheels. Ordered two new ones and they should have arrived today.  I am starting to become concerned about replacement parts availability  for this car....not sure it was worth the $$ spent","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uA9VZLezL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uA9VZLezL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uA9VZLezL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VKnSj8WvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VKnSj8WvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VKnSj8WvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ukTfGW44L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ukTfGW44L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ukTfGW44L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AF3P6YDIUZ27I7HTNXXDFTIZT3KQ,1555870969060,26,True

923,2.0,Expensive Money Pit,"[[VIDEOID:274759ea421d64cd27575b029a7d1e01]] I purchased this rc car for my son’s birthday. Out of the box I was impressed with how fast is was and how balanced it was. After 2 uses I had to to replace a shock because a clip fell of if it and I couldn’t just buy a clip so the entire shock was purchased. After about 10 uses the all wheel drive stopped working and I only had power to the front wheels. Coincidentally this failure happened 3 days after the return period. I reached out to the company and they told me to send videos so that an engineer could trouble shoot what the problem was, and to attach my original purchase invoice. I did that and I was hoping they would replace the defective part or replace the car. The company told me I need to buy new gears for the motors. So after $200 and 10 uses later I need to buy more parts for this rc car. I understand a hobby rc car will need new parts but after only 10 uses this should not be an issue. To put icing on the cake, the parts needed are not available and on back order. I would spend a little more money and purchase an rc car from a more well known manufacturer next time.

1021,2.0,Cheap plastic that breaks easy,"You get what you pay for. This was an inexpensive way into fast rc cars. But the quality is cheap. Bought 2 of these on prime day but just opened on Christmas. Having a fast car made mostly of plastic doesn't yield it lasting long. At the speeds it goes you're gonna bump into stuff. The front upper arm broke within 15 minutes. On the other car I gave to my son his wheel came off within 10 minutes even though we tightened the bolts as recommended before using it. Fortunately found the bolt that held it on and avoided that problem. But then 10 minutes later the shell top cover cracked.

Also tonight the thing went nuts in full reverse for no reason at all ( absolutely no moisture at the time which is what i figured caused something like that a previous time) luckily it went into a bush and got stuck or it was going in the street.  It also was over heating after 3 batteries but it is 93 f outside and it was in grass the whole time so i guess i can't really be too upset about that.<br />  It is a blast to play with and i guess for the price it's worth it as long as it doesn't keep going nuts on its own",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AG5PZ7QDAZMDB4ZTWD7SHYK7IW6A,1564532325907,2,True

Honestly, I don't have another car to compare, but for the price, I'm very happy about how it runs, how responsive it is, and how sturdy it feels.  My only complaint is that the instructions do not necessarily match everything, but the mismatched stuff is small.  For example, it states when charging a battery, the charger will have a green light, with red lights indicating charge level.  In actuality, the green light flashes when charging and is solid when fully charged.  I'm very happy with this purchase thus far.

To their credit, they responded to my inquiry within a couple hours and shipped a new battery(which i just received today) amazingly fast.  i received the truck on monday, and today is thursday and i have the 2nd battery in my hand.  great little truck for fun around the yard and impressive customer service, i'll likely get a 2nd one soon so the kids can race each other.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AEX6OTZG7UQSLQGQME7OM3QF4SCQ,1555601543560,0,True

I can buy two of these for the cost of one Traxxas or similar when you factor that you have to buy the batteries and charger separately.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Comes with 2 batteries and an adapter so that you can use both batteries at once.<br />Batteries are fully enclosed inside the frame of the truck.<br />Seems durable and reliable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Advertised speed of 30 MPH is probably somewhat misleading. I do think it's probably somewhat slower than that.<br />My dog can catch it at full speed on grass. Perhaps it's faster on pavement, but I haven't tried. Boxers are relatively fast dogs, but definitely not the fastest out there. If you are buying it for the purpose of dog exercise, keep this in mind.

1086,1.0,Awesome truck - but jumping ship,"[[VIDEOID:da1a1c9ac8cfc8449b4819fa183c323e]] Update to my review below.<br />After more damage and more overpriced parts, I'm jumping to Traxxas. After a little research, their parts are MUCH more appropriately priced - and available everywhere. Laegendary doesn't have anything on their parts page under $10 (even tiny screws, which would be pennies apiece). Running this car has been a blast for my son, and it's sad to just ditch it, but the nickel-and-diming from the company (eg, not even including the necessary parts for repair - everything is separate and overpriced) has been overwhelming and draining. Time to go.<br /><br />I’m torn on this mixed review. Here are my honest experiences since buying this for my 7-year-old in November (3 months in so far.)<br /><br />TLDR: Awesome car. Steep learning curve. Be prepared. I was not.<br /><br />He had his heart set on an X-Maxx like he sees on YouTube. Very much not in our price range. But we wanted to go up a notch since experiencing his first car, the Deere RC in the $50 range (awesome little car, very durable and runs great, but got very hard to steer.) After much research, this Legend seemed very cool, and a great step up.<br /><br />It is the first car like this we’ve owned, and I wasn’t clear on the ride we were in for.<br /><br />The car itself is really amazing and super fun. Our son LOVES it. It’s fast and easy to control. The steering trim and radius adjustments are fantastic. The High and Low speeds are great.<br /><br />Honestly, it’s a little beast, and can take quite a beating. Our kid doesn’t know the word “subtle,” and he runs it hard. Jumps are his thing, along with donuts, spin-outs…whatever makes it fun.<br /><br />Again – first car like this I’ve owned, and even the fact that the top shell is removable came as a surprise, let alone the fact that it has a complete replaceable parts breakdown. Cool, I thought, but wasn’t sure if we’d ever actually get into that.<br /><br />Man, was I wrong.<br /><br />3 months in, we’ve already spent more than the original price of the car in parts. None of them are that expensive… but bit by bit, over time, they sure add up.<br /><br />The shell cotter pins come off VERY easily. We now run with only 2 or 3 to prevent excessive loss. I found a couple at a local hardware store, but wound up buying a set of the originals.<br /><br />After seeing how long the battery lasts, I wound up getting 3 more. We always run with a double set and have 2 on the chargers.<br /><br />We busted a front shock on the first day. I now have 3 spares.<br /><br />The front bumper is only attached at 2 places. I’ve been very disappointed at that, being the part that takes the main impact. It came off after about a month.<br /><br />The arm connecter (the metal plate on the under-side front) broke, finally rendering it undrivable. It took a month for the part to come, and when it did, it came without screws. Those apparently are a separate part for which they charge $1 per incredibly tiny screw. I spent hours trying to find them online, and came close with a machine company who sold virtually the same one for $.11/screw, but the thread was wrong, so I’m waiting for the OEM to arrive.<br /><br />After 2.5 months, my son noticed an unusual noise that we couldn’t diagnose. We took video and sent it to the company who suggested that we ""replace the differentials."" As if that’s just something that people do. They arrived quickly, and I slowly learned - as I waded into repair - that this was a full tear-down. Be sure to label your screws!! I found a video on YouTube that was much more helpful than the Legend tutorial. We also had to run out to get grease from Pepboys since none comes with the parts. Apparently, half of the rear drive gear was stripped – and we’re still not sure why.<br /><br />After finally getting the car fully rebuilt and back to “new,” including bumpers and new LED wiring harness, it was great to run it again.<br /><br />Then the rear light wires broke – again – on the first run. Just today. So back to the online shop we go.<br /><br />Overall, the company has been helpful and responsive. I’ve reached out with my frustration of the experience.<br /><br />I realize (learning!) that playing hard has consequences, and thankful that we CAN do repairs. I half-want to tell my son to ""run it easier,"" but that's no fun, and not what it's for. I get that.<br /><br />I do wish that some parts were built better, like the front bumper and the wiring harness. I wish they had a better solution for the shell pins – they come off way too easily, and I wish there was more of a quick-release way to remove the shell to change the batteries and access power. While most parts are priced well, some are extremely overpriced. I wish screws were included with essential replacement parts, and that grease came with gears. Things like that.<br /><br />And, obviously, be prepared and comfortable to take stuff apart and put it back together. I am, but not everybody is.<br /><br />I didn’t know any of this when I bought the RC. I wish I did. Now you do. I hope it’s helpful. Buy this awesome little car. Be prepared, and have fun!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-+39IsbzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-+39IsbzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-+39IsbzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812zxgvOB-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812zxgvOB-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812zxgvOB-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813ulIFLiwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813ulIFLiwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813ulIFLiwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815ha1RfrCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815ha1RfrCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815ha1RfrCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SWl4Rr6jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SWl4Rr6jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SWl4Rr6jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YqGRRI+8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YqGRRI+8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YqGRRI+8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iGeEo2ILL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iGeEo2ILL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iGeEo2ILL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bbDTEOTGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bbDTEOTGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91bbDTEOTGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91mZNUBtCSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91mZNUBtCSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91mZNUBtCSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHWLLYTYF7RB5SX3J7XXIJABGWAA,1613187925983,45,True

Initially I had the LED lights plugged in backwards and customer service was willing to send out a new set of lights had I not determined my mistake. After the 4th day of driving, the rear axle stopped engaging. Disassembly isn't difficult, and the included instruction manual has a nice diagram of all the screws that need to be removed to access the rear gearbox. I tried tightening the gearbox to see if that would fix the problem, but it persisted. Customer service sent out a new gear box immediately.

This beast will pop a wheelie if you punch it!<br /><br />All three of my boys (11, 9, and 7) got the hang of the controls very quickly and were able to run this thing through its paces with ease.  There are two speed modes (low and high) so you can dial it back for the little ones.  I started my 7 year old on the low speed, but he kicked it up into high after about 5 minutes and never looked back.  Most importantly, this thing is super durable!  Despite my almost constant coaching/pleading, my boys crashed this thing into a variety of obstacles (mailboxes, sprinkler valves, planters, trees, and curbs to name a few), and I'm happy to say that it has taken all the abuse like a champ.

1149,5.0,So fun! Easy enough for a 9-year-old with a little practice.,"This truck is so much fun! I bought it for my 9-year-old nephew and now I want one for myself. I figured, correctly, that the speed would be a bit hard for him, as a beginner, to handle. I made sure that he used it in a big, open area where he couldn’t crash into anything until he got the hang of it. It didn’t take long for him to get a feel for it. While this isn’t really classified as a child’s toy, it can be used by older children with a little care and practice. That being said, he’s run the truck over curbs, through dirt and grass, over uneven, rocky terrain, you name it. This truck can handle whatever we throw at it. It’s crazy fast, incredibly stable, and a blast to drive! There was one incident where the steering stopped responding but somehow it corrected itself. I wasn’t with him at the time but from what he and his dad described it sounds like there was perhaps a communication error between the car and the remote. Whatever the problem was, nothing was broken and the car worked perfectly again the next day. It’s been about two weeks and aside from dirt and a few scratches, the truck works just as well as the day it arrived. I don’t have anything to compare this to but I would highly recommend this truck for anyone except maybe inexperienced kids younger than about 8 or so. And for kids it’s probably best to keep the speed on the low setting. Still plenty fast!",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AGMINGVKGS42XHQPVEOOISTFSOJQ,1568106674153,2,True

I saw this model had outstanding reviews, and had everything I needed to start. Most of the hobby models are $300+, and don't include batteries or a controller. This model is perfect for getting into RC cars. It was all the replacement parts you need in case you break something. For $160 you won't find a better set. Its definitely more durable than I expected it to be. I figured it would be easy to break at this price point. I was wrong. I crashed it several times my first time out with it. I crashed into a break wall at full speed and it just kept going. I banged it up pretty good and it never affected its performance. Its also pretty easy to control, my 2 year old was starting to get the hang of the controls after about 5 minutes. If you want to get into RC trucks this is 100% the best product to get.

1157,5.0,Loctite the Wheels!,"I bought this product for my 9 and 11 year old boys.  They got one each.  In reading the instructions it said to tighten the wheels before each use.  I did it for one of the trucks but forgot it for the other.  Lo and behold, the one I forgot to tighten had its right front wheel came off and I lost one of the hub assembly parts when the wheel came off.  This hub assembly has a cross bar that runs through the drive shaft allowing for the hub assembly to be secure in one place rather than rotating freely.  I had to get a small finishing nail with the right diameter to replace that small part and to make sure the hub assembly does not spin freely.<br /><br />I would advise people that the first thing they should do is but a drip of loctite (or nail polish in a pinch) on those wheel nuts (the thread on the drive shaft to be specific) to make sure the nut does not fall off.  I would not say it's a faulty design since proportionately to its size and weight, these trucks generate a lot of torque and spinning rotation that the nuts will come lose no matter what.<br /><br />The package also came with an adapter that allows two batteries to be connected to the truck at the same time, extending its running time.  The adapter on one of the truck was not working.  It's not a big deal since I've been running the trucks with just one battery at a time then replacing the batter as they run down.  These adapters are not cheap at $10 each but I bought extras anyway since I have two additional spare batteries for each truck extending the kids' driving time to around 1 1/2 hours.  Which brings me to that batteries.<br /><br />Each battery packet will run the truck around 20 minutes on low power mode with hard driving (the only way a 9 or 11 year old knows how to drive).  The truck comes with two battery packets.  I bought an extra set of two batteries for each truck which got expensive but at least it lasts long enough that the kids are satisfied with the driving time.<br /><br />Mechanically I have not run into any problems so far.  The kids run the trucks pretty hard and have been bashing objects or even roadside curbs when they get out of control.  I am expecting something to break soon just out of normal wear and tear.  Good news is Legendary pretty much sells every part in the truck if something breaks.<br /><br />I've read from others that this is not really a 1/10 scale but more a 1/16.  But for first time RC owners in my kids, it's plenty big enough and surprisingly durable.  Granted they received this as a Christmas gift so it's not even one month yet as I write this review.  I am happy with the product in general but you have to have the right expectations.  Proportionately, this thing puts loads of mechanical stress on the parts.  If you drive your car/truck like this I'm sure it will break something soon enough.  With that said, I think it is a good product.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHBIL3GE7LHPWM5SIX6CS25VAHWQ,1610045287236,7,True

Battery life is definitely not 40 minutes, more like 15 on high speed mode. Had it for a few days now and used extensively, hahaha. Took it on a jump today it landed wrong and blew out a shock and the part where it connects to the front lower arm. What I think happened is that since the truck landed mostly on one tire it maxed out the shock and spring and the force from the landing then transfered into the little plastic stub on the side of the front lower arm and blew that out as well. Factory shocks that this thing comes with aren't the worst but they aren't the best either. As soon as you can upgrade to metal shocks that are taller and have a higher spring rate. From my research on hosimrc.com there are plastic replacement parts but there are no aluminium parts to be found anywhere on any rc store for the 9125. Save yourself my trouble and UPGRADE YOUR SHOCKS AND SPRINGS!!

Finding bodies that are said to be 1/10 are around 2"" to 3"" longer than the body on this and at least 1 1/2"" to 2"" wider. The dimensions for 1/12 scale bodies are much closer to this one.

I am not nice to it.<br />Also, there is something of an aftermarket world for it. It’s basically a Hosim 9125.

And the car is zippy! Man it's fast and durable, and it seems like the batteries have been lasting longer than the 25 minutes that they advertise. We've have a blast playing with it this week, and we imagine that we have many hours of fun ahead of us this summer!<br /><br />A couple of things: the remote control was a little wonky at first so we had to turn it off and turn it back on, then we had no issues after that. Also, the power button is under the truck cover, which makes sense, I suppose (we're new to RC cars) but can take a little extra time when we're chomping at the bit to get out and play!<br /><br />Overall, this is great, and I'd recommend this company to others who are looking for a high quality, fun RC car.

1237,5.0,Awesome,"Great, fun little RC car.  I’ve got plenty of things I enjoy about the vehicle, and a couple things I dislike, or wish would’ve been done differently.  So...<br /><br />The small dislikes are the size of the vehicle, and the front “bumper” guard where the headlights rest.  The guard snapped really quickly — after first use with some beating on the vehicle.  I’ve driven cars in the past that I’ve put through the absolute worst and nothing but scratches or a couple nicks were left to show the abuse.  That’s what we buy these trucks for. Shred terrain without have to worry about breaking cars.  The second dislike is how small it is compared to other 1:10 trucks in its class. Compared to my sons 1:10 truck this thing is small.<br /><br />But that’s about it for gripes.  They can be seen as personal dislikes and I’m not one to take stats away for that.  It’s not an issue with functionality and it’s not fair to the retailer to deduct points for. Why? Well.... for starters:<br /><br />The truck looks as advertised and does every bit as it’s advertised to. It’s fast as hell and has nice response time to trigger pull.  It shines in driveway, yard, gravel and sand spots.  Just ripping it through dirt and debris, drifting it around the yard, or giving it some cliffs to jump off really make for a fun time.  It comes with two batteries that can run simultaneously.  A tool to tinker with the truck.  Nice packaging.  But most importantly, it comes with a manual for beginners that really pinpoints how to adjust the remote control to put your truck on the straight and narrow.<br /><br />This vehicle is awesome.  I wouldn’t let my kids play with it, because even at ~30 mph it’s too much vehicle for them.  I grew up around fast RCs, but they were more common then.  Now it’s hard to find anyone who enjoys it, and radio shack doesn’t exist anymore so RCs get out on the back burner anymore.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress.  Do yourself a favor, before purchasing a $500 60mph+ brushless or methane remote car, purchase this little baby and at least get your feet wet.  It does what you need. Drives smooth. Responsive and clean looking.  Enjoy adult hood without tearing up your wallet.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AESK3WITGB4OKH5DLY22JMPSACPA,1610466294127,0,True

1239,3.0,"Decent for the $$$, not true 1:10 scale, and won't go 30MPH","I bought this while it was on sale for $125.  I would say overall it is a decent product for the price since it comes with everything you need to run(batteries, chargers, etc.).  It is not true 1:10 scale though, not even close as you can see in the photo next to my Revo 1:10.  I would also like to point out that one of the batteries already has run time issues as it only last about half of the time and the unit is only 2 and a half weeks old.  In addition to this, its tops out at 22MPH at best and it's advertised at 30MPH.<br /><br />Side note...when I received the unit, there was a card for 100 free pins.  I filled everything out and reviewed the product and have not received any confirmation via email or pins in the mail.  We shall see.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Decent build for the money<br />- Comes with everything you need right out of the box<br />- Lights<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not true 1:10 scale<br />- Battery life deteriorates quickly<br />- Won't go advertised 30MPH<br /><br />I will update on the longevity of the car at a later point in time as it is too soon to tell.  Would have given 3.5 stars if there was an option.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fCr-JXgTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fCr-JXgTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fCr-JXgTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AFLHH372T75JFIU7T2SVAIGSCAIQ,1580244961864,1,True

Giving it 5 stars after using it a few times. Great for beginners and the time quoted is good 25-30 mins of play time. One battery gave my son 30mins on low speed gentle runs about the yard. Tearing around the beach and dirt tracks gave him about 25mins using the two batteries. Was unable to install the two batteries in the car - battery dock too small.<br />Oh just make sure you clean it out after tearing up the dirt track or beach. Check the added photo of sand in the motor bay. Tear down diagram was helpful. Will buy another one to race him :)<br />*We didn't use it for bashing - just flat high speed runs with a few jumps not more than 6"" high. Yes a few cartwheels happened, wheel came off during a doughnut but found the wheel nut - phew! Could do with 2 extras in the box.<br />Will try a slightly larger battery amp size for longer run times soon.<br /><br />After sending the review above, I decided to revisit the double loading of batteries.

It is super fast, does donuts easily in dirt, gravel, grass, or just about anywhere. He loves doing jumps on hills he has created, or ramps he has made.

Also, after about the 4th run of the truck, one of the wheels fell off!  Luckily it appeared that just the nut loosened up which caused the spill and we were able to find the nut and put it back together.  After that I went through and made sure to tighten all the nuts to make sure those were tight too.  Interesting, considering they're nylon locking nuts.<br /><br />Other than that, my kid loves it and we're having a lot of fun with it.

Within a day or two, he was much better and started taking jumps at full speed and doing tricks. The car has really has held up well under constant use for over a month and shows no signs of slowing down. It takes some time to change batteries (the only reason my son could think of for taking one star away from the rating). It does help to have an air compressor handy when running through very dusty ground, which we have plenty of here in the desert.

The battery life is pretty short so not as much run time as we would like and takes to long to charge the batteries. The led lights are great for night but there’s no switch to turn them off during the day, so it just drains the battery while you drive during the day.

When the wheel fell off the spacer and pin on the backside fell off and the pin was no where to be found. Fortunately I had ordered a small kit with extra parts for something like this. The second day of use the steering started acting up and would only turn to one side. This worked itself out but then the transmission locked up. So we did a return label for this car and took a a chance and ordered another car. We have not received our credit on the first one yet but I assume we will. The second car has been spot on with no problems so far. I would recommend a few things. When running the car at least one time during each battery that you run the car, stop and check the nuts on the wheels as they do get loose especially if you are doing donuts. I know they say you can run them in water but I would recommend not too. We only ran it through one small puddle one time but that seemed to be when the steering started having problems and the transmission acted up. So far the second car has been great.

Very pleased with it, was able to take it out of the box and get 15-20 mins of run time, I crashed into curbs, walls, etc, other than some scuffs, it's perfectly fine. I highly recommend this newbies and experts alike, for the price I don't think you can beat it. If you are a novice like me, I highly recommend getting replacement parts, I did dislocate the back rear shock, which just snapped back into place. but I am sure Ill end up breaking something on it......and it IS very VERY quick, I live on 30 mpg road, and it was going slightly faster than the cars I was racing. It seems to have decent range. The only thing I don't like, is that it seems to have a slight issue going into reverse at times, not sure if its me, or the truck.

1530,5.0,Great Truck for the Money,"I have been out of the RC car game for years (Tamiya Blackfoot and Kyosha Ultima days). I wanted something me and my daughter could putt around with. This truck is really well made. The old shocks were a nice surprise and it soaks up bumps pretty well. Frame is solid and it actually has metal skid plates under both hubs. The High and Low speeds are nice as in High is can get wild in a hurry. Any technical driving I needed to keep it in low. Other than ripping in a straight line the High is way fast, too fast for my reflexes. I understand there are faster trucks out there, but at this price point it is hard to beat and I am not sure I can handle going much faster without destroying the truck or my neighbors property. Controller also seems to be solid, but keep in mind this is not a Futaba nor are you paying a Futaba price. They also seem to have some parts availability which was important to me, though some are on backorder including the body.<br /><br />The only bad things I can think of is the body pins get lost quick. Putting some rubber ring washers under the body at each of the mount points would probably help. Probably also my fault as I have a bit of road rash on the body after a couple batteries lol.  Also while listed at 1/10 this is a tad smaller than that scale.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and the seller seems to care about their customer.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AFSWNFPKMNCEYDAS5PKBOPZE4KJQ,1563943435246,1,True

One couldn't trun left anymore and the other couldnt turn at all. I took one of the RCs apart and tested the steering mechanism box. It would not swivel the full length in one of the directions the mechanism is a Chinese part with no number or identification code so I can't even order a replacement. My and my son loved the RC trucks when they worked. The first truck lasted about 2 months before steering failed. The second newly purchased truck only lasted about 2 weeks before the steering component failed. These cost too freaking much for cheap Chinese parts to be used that fail easily. $189.00 for only two weeks of use is BS.

They also noted in their email ""Because of the torque of the car, this part can break even after 5 mins of playtime.""  That is a direct quote where they basically admit the components of the car are not sufficient.  For a $180 car I am beyond disappointed.  I now have to buy a new servo through them and I'm sure that will be expensive.  I am going to forward their email to Amazon to show they are admitting the materials used to build the car are poor quality.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />Update: I've increased my rating to 3 stars on this.  Laegendary has replied they are going to send me a replacement servo.  Once I get it they'll get another  upgrade.

Initially, it was a lot of fun, it felt sturdy and it went fast! Unfortunately, by the second use, we already had problems. The first problem was that when it was running at full speed, it would get stuck on. That presented a safety hazard, as you couldn’t decelerate or stop if it was getting close to people. Usually, it would run into something and I could pick it up and turn it off (while the wheels were still running). After a few times of this, it ran into a cement stair and the back axel broke, so now it is completely broken.

1928,3.0,Awesome trucks that broke on first day of use,"Updated- it appears that I can replace the broken part for a fairly inexpensive price.  It still broke prematurely however the overall design seems superior to the competitors.  Time will tell if this was a fluke or if it is a design prone to failure.<br /><br />Let me start by stating that I have several other similar rc trucks from competitor companies.  At first this one seemed to be superior in construction and design however the frame broke the first time in use.  The biggest problem is that it broke at a place that could not be repaired with replacement parts.  None of my other rc trucks have never had a catastrophic failure like this.  I've driven thr others for months and only ever had to replace a few of thr regular ""replaceable"" parts.  This was the most expensive rc truck I have and this is extremely disappointing.  Unless I can get the company to help me out I am stuck with a $150 parts kit.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816HFXZJnkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816HFXZJnkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816HFXZJnkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mgxqm2GKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mgxqm2GKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mgxqm2GKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AFEMSLSPAHKQBMCXCG5HPSD6IXXQ,1612110486921,1,True
1929,2.0,Car is a rebranded 9125 Xinlehong. Breaks constantly.,"This car is a rebranded 9125 Xinlehong RC car. Uses all the exact same part numbers. The parts are very cheap and break easily.<br /><br />I have had this car for 4 months now and with regular bashing experience can tell you the weaknesses and parts that break a lot. So far I have replaced 4 Front Drive shafts, 3 Rear Transmission Cups, and 3 Differentials.<br /><br />All of the parts I have ordered online take a very long time to arrive so you usually have to buy them in larger quantities. Additionally, one of the motors tweaked out after being driven through a puddle and required a creative repair which I was able to do. (So far have not had to replace the motors)<br /><br />Some other issues: the plastic Screw threads will strip out because you are constantly having to work on the car to change things. You can try the CA GLUE trick to try to fix the plastic threads but you could end up getting yourself a stuck screw.<br /><br />The car broke within 3 days of first usage, (front drive shaft) then within 2 weeks of usage the rear differential went out. 2 weeks later the next differential went out. Following a few minor crashes, the Rear Transmission cups bent and needed replacing. The tire plastic bindings are breaking but can be glued using CA glue to reinforce them. They are still going strong. Following those initial breaks, I continued to have the same breaks over the following months. Probably the most frustrating break is the Differentials just do not last.<br /><br />I am not that hard of a basher, in fact, I am a decent RC driver and have very few hard crashes. On average, even with basic street driving the average life span of your differential is about 2-4 weeks, while the life span of the Servo is about 2 months. I was able to repair the servo myself without replacing it by manipulating the gears. The gears inside the servo are plastic and break easily.<br /><br />I also own an Arrma Granite. I spent $210 dollars on the Arrma Granite and for the price I have spent on parts for that car, I can say with confidence that the Legend Rebranded knock off of the rebranded 9125 Xinlehong RC is not worth your money. You will end up spending way more money and time on fixing it then you would if you spent money on an Arrma Granite. Additionally, any Arrma or Traxas product can be fully upgraded and customized. The Legend Truck cannot.<br /><br />Companies that sell cheap products like this know they will make a huge profit because you will be constantly buying replacement parts. Arrma is a much more trustworthy company that makes RC cars that go the distance. Out of the time I've owned the Granite, I've only had to replace two parts, the motor ($20 bucks) and a spur gear ($4 bucks). For this Legend Truck (rebranded 9125 Xinlehong) I have spent over $100 bucks on replacement parts already.<br /><br />Do the math, Buy an Arrma Granite for $210 and spend way less money on parts or buy a knock off Xinlehong 9125 and spend  $160 bucks plus $100 dollars in parts and repairs over the course of 4 months.<br /><br />The only reason its rated 2 stars is because apart from it constantly breaking, the car is fun to drive, has great handling, and has some nice zip to it.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AGK2MB6DYZAFHIA5BCDEJXNZ6BCQ,1588308862334,1,True

1980,5.0,"Great Truck! Powerful, Great Quality for price! Smaller than 1/10!","First off this is a great truck for the price.  The truck itself is sturdy has great oil filled shocks and metal skid plates and bogbones.  Tires are great and high quality.  The battery last longer than I thought it would and the double battery system, although odd, is pretty cool.  That leads to it's first down fall.  The battery compartment is too small.  One battery fit snug in there.  Two batteries aren't supposed to fit.  The Legend comes with a velcro strap to secure the batteries when you use both at once.  With the amount of slack on the wires and the bulky two battery connector it is hard to get the batteries seated properly.  However once you find a way that works the strap secures it well enough.  Careful though when you use both batteries you have to leave off the lid.  This may lead to water getting in there.  I would recommend if your driving it in wet conditions to use one battery with the lid secure.  With the double batteries you get great playtime!!  If it is dry I have no problems using the double batteries.  Overall I love the idea and the choice of using one or two!  Next I would say the remote works well however feels kinda cheap but has nice functions on the top. Trim,dual rate adjustment(steering) , steering reverse, speed mode(high or low).  Once the power is turned on  lights illuminate along the top functions as indicators.  The steering wheel feels good and with the Dual rate adjustment I was able to set it up at the right sensitivity that felt right.  Overall happy with the remote, wish it felt of higher quality, but works well and does the job.  Powering on the Legend and giving it a spin instantly you can tell this thing is a beast for the price!  Thing has tons of torque!  When in high speed you can pop wheelies at any speed with a quick pull of the throttle.  I wish this thing came with a wheelie bar installed.  I may try to get one for it.  The shocks work great when making jumps.  It's just a delight to drive around.  Has a good hum of the motors and isn't as loud as I thought.  Truck looks great however its a bit small for 1/10 scale.  When compared to my 1/12 scale car it is taller and wider but shorter.  I supplied pictures for reference.  Seems like to me they should have it labeled 1/12 but I'm not sure exactly how scales work.  Overall I very happy with the looks of the truck.  The shock color and dual shocks in the back look great.  The body looks great also.  Tires look huge and wheels are cool.<br /><br />So quick over view<br /><br />This truck is a beast with 4wd and lots of torque.  It is fast and powerful.  Comes with 2 lipo batteries, 1 usb charger, 1 wall charger, double battery connector and velcro strap to secure when using double batteries.  Cool system but in double mode be careful in wet conditions because the lid is left off battery compartment. Remote has great functions and steering wheel but feels a little cheap.  Does the job.

I tried 3S and plastic frame parts will not hold up to abuse unless you Engineer the weak spots and problem solve. I went back to 2S and still get enjoyment and less parts breaking.<br /><br />Weakest areas ive found so far is the upper arms snap, Rims start to crack after jumping and ramping, Shocks plastic tube will start to bust in half from lands or what not. I have replaced these numerously. I think i might have found the solution. Good quality parts are hard to find for RC's. Metal is your friend and i have not yet found any metal arms for this thing. Hopeing one day there will be metal A-Arms to upgrade to.<br /><br />So i give 4****'s for this RC. Beings your getting a awesome Power Perfomance right out the box.<br /><br />Heres the project im building 4x4 Monster Truck with 2 different sets of Clod Tires, Rims & Shocks.

2038,5.0,Great Purchase!  13 year old son and I are very pleased!,"[[VIDEOID:3cf4a32ee0871002d0a20314af2f146f]] Our first serious RC car.  It looks great.  Build quality and finish is excellent.  It has a pleasing heavy-weight feel to it, solid tires, wonderful suspension action and the undercarriage is convincing robust after putting it through it's paces on rough terrain.  It's a lot of fun to drive, both on concrete and grass. Steering is not difficult, but we were glad to have the half speed option to get used to controlling.  We had it spinning and bouncing around trees throwing up clouds of dust and acorns.  Quality of USB chargers for two batteries seem good.  We roughly got about 15 minutes charge out of each battery.

2051,5.0,Fast learning curve and boy this thing is durable!,"The car was wicked right out of the gate.  I followed the recommendations for break in and as time passed, it got faster and faster.  Loads of power and  great control and the steering response is tweakable with the the RC controller.  I have about 1/4 acre back yard with plenty of obstacles for ""training"" including rocks, ramps and trees to avoid with a few dusty areas for ""burn outs""...awesome!<br />So I'm not an engineer but my first observation was battery life was ""so so"" even when coupling the 2 batteries together so I took a chance and bought two 7000mAh Lipo batteries off Amazon which work well.  Or at least work until the heat protection circuit of the car kicks in and brings everything to a halt.  It's worth getting extra batteries and maybe a second car when the first one overheats.  I modified my car by putting some brackets in the mid-body to hold a strap and keep the large heavy battery in place (see above).  There is a relatively ""safe"" area to put in some small screws to hold these brackets and secure a strap.  I also bought a bunch of stickers to adorn the body.  My kids had fun putting them on!!...hehe.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkmsUkknL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkmsUkknL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tkmsUkknL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81koOub8XML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81koOub8XML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81koOub8XML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pn2b4T6VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pn2b4T6VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pn2b4T6VL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHOZXSQ7BASKRUUPYZDYS5R7HN6Q,1565400139560,2,True

2054,5.0,Best features - control over turning radius and 2 speed settings,"PROs: My 8 year old and I bought these for fun together. We have taken them to campsite with lots of tress and leaves and open space and to the beach.  It exceeds expectations and is a blast.  The range of the remote goes further than your vision allows.  The 2 speed settings helps with control in the environment.  The control over turn radius made a huge difference in controlling 360s and spin outs in sand and leaves.  We never ran out of battery and played for an hour or so each time.  The batteries are very tightly packed.<br />CONS: you need  pretty big open space to play with them, the batteries and connectors are such a tight fit there is only one way they fit and the connector had to be turned a certian way and slightly forced into place. i liked that it was tightly packed.  At the beach we violated one of the rules and drove into an approaching 2-3 inch wave and the water fought the steering and popped the gear so we lost steering.  Based on the simplicity of the build for home maintenance, we expect to be able to disassemble and reset.  Finally - reverse works very well as a brake but I had a hard time getting the reverse itself to engage. Reverse does require a 2 step stop and reverse trigger movement but I had a hard time with the latter.  It always eventually worked but after multiple attempts at times.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHS6LNMLZA6QOSUMUJ7VB77O5WVA,1595993368138,0,True

2109,5.0,Awesome starter RC Cars,"I bought 2 Laegendary RC cars at first, one for me and one for my youngest daughter (the older one wasnt intersted).  Right away, we all found out how much fun it is to race up and down the street in front of our house.  The cars are easy to control in Low Speed, and can be almost uncontrollable in High Speed.  The fact that the cars have two speeds is a big plus.  Shortly after we got the first two cars, my older daughter decided she needed one too and since they are so affordable, I picked up another one.  So now we have a fleet of them.<br /><br />We just started using the dual-battery setup which gives you an hour or more of runtime depending on how you drive.  The motors never overheat nor do the batteries.  They do get warm but never to the point you cant touch them.  The same is true for charging.  I charge them in an aluminum pan that is used for heating food so if they did ever decide to overheat, nothing would burn.<br /><br />We have had some hard crashes and broken parts, but that was not a big deal as the parts are readily available on Amazon and (before the virus outbreak) delivered in a day or two.  These cars may be priced like toys, but they are well engineered, easily repairable machines.  We have only broken bumpers, headlights, and suspension parts.  All were easily fixed.  The support from Laegendary has been amazing as well.  After every purchase, you get a personalized email from the company and they will respond quickly if you have questions.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these cars to anyone wanting to get into RC without spending hundreds or thousands of dollars.  They are not as fast as some of the other brands, but unless you have wide open spaces to run them, getting a 50MPH car might be overkill.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AFKWVPOJFHOQX6PARKZXYW2M3NUA,1585872633409,0,True

2126,3.0,"parts readily available, out of the box it handles great!!!","This truck is absolutely amazing for the money. It’s fast stock out of a box. It’s durable. It has replacement parts readily available. The battery(s) run time is excellent. The staff/customer service behind this product is kind and super friendly. If you email them they respond quickly and are most helpful. What more could you ask for for the price!?!?! Remote control works 100% perfectly fine, only reason I didn’t give it a five is due to the fact that I have huge hands and wished the trigger fit my hand better. Also Is made out of slightly cheaper plastic HOWEVER is still sturdy. It’s a lot better than the $30 to $50 car remotes. Trim works well for both steering and speed. Offers a High and Low mode speed wise. I’ve ran it on x2 3S batteries repeatedly and it still works great!!! I’ve seen some people put 4s-5s on it with an additional mini ESC cooling fan. And OMG DOES IT GET SUPER FAST! Whether your are you racing on the track or jumping it at the skate park. (As long as you don’t miss treated terribly by jumping as high as you can and letting it just smack the ground) this truck handles awesome and can take it no problem. Having all the oil filled shocks is always a plus. It also comes with some bright lights which is cool for dusk driving and at night time. Basically unless you’re use to $500-thousand dollar trucks. This thing is probably the best value for the money I’ve found yet in the RC world. Cheers!<br /><br />PS-after a few runs CVD treaded axle and rear outer transmission cups seem to be easily bendable. Gotta watch out for that. Is definitely a good idea to purchase spare parts (specifically those pieces first when ordering the truck to begin with). Note: they do not offer a better/stronger upgradable solution to this. So if you like race tracks with 1ft or higher jumps included/any kind of bashing whatsoever. Definitely be sure to upgrade suspension and lift it up a little bit, not a bad idea to apply suspension bumpers (to keep truck from bottoming out). And if you bought a truck that came with oil shocks. Be sure to check oil levels out of the box as they often do not come as full as they should be. I switched to a thicker weight oil(50-60wt). Lifted the truck just under a 1/4 of an inch after my first run because of the bent wheel axles (that happened almost immediately). So I just ordered all new dogbones/CVD joints and 108mm oil filled shocks, made shock bumpers out of my old nitro truck fuel line tubing, added cooler (and extra) lighting which is now externally powered off those baby 1/3 sized 18650 type batteries = 7.4v nominal so they weigh basically nothing stay lit for a really really long time between chargers and most importantly leave the drive train power alone. I was able to do all of these upgrades and MOD’s for under $15.<br /><br />Replacement bumpers, dogbones, drive cups(wheel hubs/axles) will cost you around $40-$50. I am a avid deal Hunter so I was able to find some of these things much cheaper costing me a total of only $32.<br /><br />Don’t let any of this discourage you. This is still one of my favorite trucks I’ve ever got. But like any off-road remote-control vehicle. You’ve got to figure out it’s weak spots and experiment with what works for you under your specific applications. Also I put some street tires on it for parking lot racing, huge difference. Also found some PVC piping that I was able to cut and fit over top of the stock tires for some extreme drifting that resulted in a ton of fun if you ever wanna switch it up every now and again. Tutorials for that easily found on YouTube.<br /><br />Enjoy your truck!!!! Drive it respectfully and it’ll perform like a champ.<br /><br />Also, I wouldn’t bother with any brushless upgrades. Because at that point you’ll be needing a wheelie bar and a decent amount of work on the steering mechanism. The stock motors and ESC operate great with the batteries that come with it. And As long as the C rating isn’t too high, 3S Lipo’s make this thing scream (although it’s not recommended by the manufacturer and I’m sure it will obviously caused faster wear and tear). But if you like wrenching. 3s power in these things it pretty awesome as well (gotta be more careful tho).<br /><br />Update: after talking with customer service about the issues I did have.... I must say I am blown away at the amount of care and time they put into me. They are super honest, very understanding and ridiculously helpful. They definitely helped me out to the point that I’m going togo buy their other two trucks just because. I love supporting a company like this especially when they support me. Cheers to Their whole team!

Car handles High grass, low grass, concrete, jumps, drops, and hits wonderfully.<br />2) Battery: Simple chargers and two LiPo batteries. Comes with a sturdy and well made connector so both batteries can be linked and extend run time. Blew me away with battery life, i'm not used to R/C Cars as much, but with a fresh charge and both batteries, I ran this car hard for almost an hour if not more.<br />3) Controller/Transmitter: Does what it needs to do, but compared to the car, it is VERY cheap feeling in your hand. However it does work well.<br /><br />Overall 8/10 would definitely recommend as a starter to see if R/C cars are your thing.",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHNPGKFQ7FQIHL32QFEUDNUN45BA,1590006355609,1,True

2173,5.0,Worth every penny and more...seriously!!,"I have been looking to find a high quality ""real deal"" RC vehicle for a reasonable price for quite a while.  I kept on coming back to Laegendary's RC lineup because the price, promo video, & pictures appeared to show me that this was a quality RC vehicle that I could have some serious fun with.  However, since I couldn't touch/feel/kick the tires, had never heard of the brand before, etc it still felt risky.  Also, the way the Amazon page sensationalizes the vehicle so much I had a lingering thought that the company might be ""all hat and no cattle"" just like so many other sellers on Amazon. Ultimately, I thought ""what the heck"" and took the plunge and ordered it.  I am so glad I did because this thing is AWESOME, and Laegendary is spot on with their advertising!  I didn't know exactly what to expect, but this toy is a great quality and a TON OF FUN!  I have been so impressed that this company does not seem to have cut any corners, which you just don't see often anymore.  The materials used to build this car appear to be high quality metals and plastics and appear to be made to last.<br />In terms of function, this has been incredibly fun to use and is FAST...REALLY FAST!  So fast in fact the very first time I pulled the trigger I flipped the truck over, so make sure you have it on the low speed mode until you get used to the crazy acceleration and speed.  This truck is all-wheel drive and still burns the tires easily, is surprisingly agile, and can pretty much take on any terrain you throw at it.<br />There is only one small defect I noticed right out of the box is one of the rear dog-bones is slightly bent, so I will be contacting support to see if a replacement can be sent.<br />Finally, it was such a cool surprise to see that this company is passionate about charities, as you'll find in an insert that comes with the manual.  Way to be an upstanding company!<br />To sum it up: if you are looking to purchase a great quality RC car, do not hesitate to give this company a try!",[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AG52MY3M4EWS2TKOQYSVXZTUP7DA,1585705457977,0,True

2204,4.0,"Good RC truck-fast, powerful and easy to use","I did a LOT of research and decided to purchase the 1:10 Legend for my 9 year old son.  He loves it.  I thought it would be too big but it is the perfect size.  The RC is fast, powerful, has solid weight and with the ability to use 2 batteries at once we get more run time.  The (2) 1600mah batteries last a longer than 30 minutes since he doesn't go full throttle all the time.  This truck does go very fast but is really easy to use.  The batteries take 2 hours or more to charge but you get 2 chargers so it's ideal to be able to charge both batteries at once. So far my only complaint is the front and rear bumpers are made of thin plastic and break very easily.  The front bumper broke the first time playing with the truck and the replacement parts are not cheap.  Now my son is afraid to play with it with the bumper broken.  I think if the bumper was made in such a way that they were supported from behind instead of being attached at the bottom that would be a big improvement.  Maybe if they were made of rubber coated metal or hard rubber that would be ideal since this is where the impact happens.  See included image of bumper broken in two places where it attaches to the chassis.  Other than that great RC!  I actually got the 1:16 Sonic brushless model for myself (hey, my kid needs to play with someone, right? lol) but the 1:16 is a little small and it flips over easily.

We’ve yet to drive it long enough to run the battery out so I don’t know how long it would last but it has been plenty for my kids. I only have two small complaints.  One is the light wire is barely long enough to plug in and so with the tension on the wire the lights tend to pop out of the bumper. The other is I wish it was possible to turn the car off without removing the pins and the body.  My kids will play with it for 10 minutes and then do something else for 30 minutes and then play with it again and it’s a pain to keep removing and reinstalling the body (because they can’t do it on their own).

It also comes with two chargers: wall outlet and USB. Very nice!<br />Instructions about battery maintenance are a bit alarming. For example ""don't charge over 24 hours"", ""don't leave battery inside, when not used for long time"". Again, I understand the reasoning, but this means adult attention is required.<br />The car is super powerful! it can climb at 50-60 degrees angle, it goes through mud, sand, gravel, water. It is truly off-road truck. Amazing!<br />You can also do stunts with it, car is very durable. It can jump, fall, hit obstacles without damage. Keep in mind though. If hit at full speed, this car can cause damage to your pet, child or even adult. Power comes with responsibility.<br />Oh, and it can drift!<br /><br />I don't recommend this car for kids under 5.

Again, you'll see similar products from other companies, but none in the price range with these features (oil shocks, 2 batteries ect) and NONE from a company that offers top notch customer service and old fashioned American values (laegendary.com).  Keep this in mind when shopping: these toys do break over time, and you'll need to communicate with someone to get parts and support.

Great handling, able to handle surprisingly rough terrain from deep think grass, to river rock and a marshy grassy area.  The headlines and tail lights make if fun to run at dusk as well. The two speed options makes it great to have a ""beginner"" mode for younger or less experienced drivers.<br /><br />The battery charge time does take quite a long time but considering I get 30+ minutes or run time depending on the terrain and driving style it's understandable but be prepaired 2+hours for a full batter charge was a little unexpected at fist but with two batteries included that helps break up the wait time.

The only issue that I do have with the Legend is that the the response of the control isn't very up to my standards.. When going from full throttle to reverse there is a big delay and for me to get it to reverse it seems like I have to come to a complete stop before it will start reverse. Most RC cars have touchy response and immediately break hard and most will spin the tires in reverse to stop the Rc as soon as possible. Also the battery isn't very long lasting. Definitely not as long as they claim but I was happy to find out that they supplied two batteries in the box.<br />Beside those two things I recommend this car for even the novice Rc drivers.,[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AFUPEGI6F4EYVFSUPQXBYP7NZMJA,1590407635127,0,True

2448,5.0,Big Bang for your bucks!,"I’m still relatively new to the hobby. I bought several of the cheaper cars which work great in their own way. However I found this one heavily discounted and thought I would try it. I have to tell you this thing is a blast! The battery life is unreal I Clock it doing 33mph an hour out of the box. That may not seem like much when you’re driving your own car,however stand still and let that car fly by you at 30 miles an hour it’s fast.

2457,5.0,The most important Thing to know is This Car isnt completly waterproof,It says this car is waterproof but in the guide it clearly says not to let water go pass the bottom of the truck. which I thought was completely waterproof. I guess that's kind'a false advertisement I don't know. And its a great thing they give you to batteries because in rough terrain and beach sand the batteries don't last that long. Other than that I think its a great truck handles and plays well. Tough and durable fast for the price its a great buy very fun. I would recommend this truck and great price for beginners.,[],B07F38CPM1,B0BCH73PFC,AHHKZHILV5DNDU6MZJ54VWOTDVUQ,1556677648559,0,False

2461,5.0,Simply the BEST,"I have been in RC for along time. I have 2 Nitro Buggies and an electric airplane. ALL way more expensive than this 4wd truck. I got the as an ""in between"" car, but now its my go to!! its so much fun and reliable and fast. I submerged it in water (by accident) and it kept going. I hit a concrete parking block full blast.... no damage!! I beat the hell out of this for months... every day... no damage. The main gear wore out is what took it out, so of coarse I just bought another!!! and so did my brother. Were both VERY impressed. Like I said in the header Simply the best!! I just wish that you wouldn't advertise so much.... that's the only down side I see because once word really gets out about this truck, its going to cost to much, or they wont be able to keep up with demand.
