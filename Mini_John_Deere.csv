11,4.0,Great Fun!,"We ordered one similar to this 3 years ago when our son was 2.5years old.  It was easy for him to steer and he quickly caught on.  3 years later at 5.5 years he still loves riding it.  We have had no trouble with the battery charging or run time.  We did however spend more $ on 2 12 inch bicycle tires, cut the sidewalls off and slipped them over the back wheels no glue needed.

12,4.0,Would recommend it,"We bought this for our 3 yo son for Xmas. We thought he could use it in the basement over the cold winter.<br /><br />He's never had a power wheel before so when he tried it inside, even setting 1 startled him how fast it responded and how fast it went. So we had to wait for spring to take it outside.<br /><br />Works in the grass decently and up and down small slopes. His favorite is to use it in our garage/double driveway area though.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend it to you. Holds a charge well (I don't charge it as often as they say) and recharges fast when you you notice it slowing down and plug it in for a couple hours or overnight.<br /><br />Only cons: the tires are hard plastic of course so in certain circumstances it doesn't grip too: going up grassy hills but it still usually manages. The hood in the &#34;engine&#34; sort of fits inside the bottom part of the frame but 1 side pops out and overhangs. Doesn't affect function just not as esthetically pleasing. Also, the plastic pin for the wagon hookup doesn't turn and lock as it's supposed to; ours just has to sit in the hole and it doesn't bounce out",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AFYBWDB4DKGYF5QXNDCAFQOM4USQ,1496835794000,0,False
13,5.0,Very happy with my purchase.,This was a gift for my grandchild a year and a half ago. He still rides it all over my 1.5 acre grass yard. It is stored on the carport at night but it's been rained on and the Florida sun has beat down on it for two summers. The color has not faded. The battery life is the same as when purchased (we only charge it when it's completely dead). The only thing that has gotten broken on it is one of the wheel fenders that my grandson bent backwards. The pull behind cart is still in excellent condition and carries his toys all over the place. We attached a bicycle cup holder and a horn to the tractor. The grandson loved it! The radio doesn't pick up very many stations. And it resets every time you turn the radio off. So we have to find a station rather often at times. But that's really my only complaint. This is a fantastic toy that has gotten a lot of use and enjoyment.,[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AGC5E55NEKHUGUJUL4FZQV45A2UQ,1587503327647,1,True

21,3.0,Pay Attention to the Details,"The workmanship in the fabrication of these parts is so-so.  Also, a word of caution for you if you are not somewhat savvy with reading and following directions - there are steps that are skipped in their entirety in the assembly process.  If you’re not savvy with putting things together these directions can be confusing.  You can do it but TAKE YOUR TIME.<br /><br />There are points of assembly that I was disappointed in.  There are no working headlights.  I knew they would not be but think for the amount spent it could have been something featured as well.  The front most plastic piece you screw onto the front end is not a weight-bearing attachment.  Please do not pick up by that piece - make sure you pick it up by the actual undercarriage.  Otherwise you will probably break it by lifting from that piece after a few times.  Additionally, the radio is installed before you put the steering wheel on.  I’m not so sure you can just take that off without taking the steering wheel off.  I will follow up a review after six months to see how it continues to hold up.  I also will have to do some rework on the cart wheels.  They started coming loose when my son was riding it around.  The trailer hitch goes on easy but I tried to take it off later and I could not get it to budge.  But it won’t arbitrarily fall off, which is a positive thing.<br /><br />I don’t want to focus on the negative - there are plenty of good to this item and our son really enjoys it so far.  The radio really works.  I had to release the selector button (it was installed incorrectly from the factory), but I had preselected a good station for my son before we surprised him with it.  The seat and arm rests were a good fit for him.  The battery has lasted for a fair amount of time so far - if you follow the recommendations on the instructions regarding charging it I’m certain it will last for quite a bit but READ THOSE INSTRUCTIONS!  Most of the issues I have found were minor compared to reviews where people talked about the battery not working after a few months - I don’t know how the parent/grandparents maintained it, but the manufacturer is very specific on what to do.<br /><br />It drives well in the grass but high grass with an incline might require a little “parent power” to assist.<br /><br />It’s a good toy that I think will last for some time if my son takes care of it and I help by doing the required battery maintenance, but to rough handle it, I would think it wouldn’t hold up for very long.  But that’s where adult supervision comes into play.  I am not disappointed in my purchase but it’s not a carefree item.  You will get out of it what you invest in it with proper maintenance and upkeep.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AFM4GAN32IB66KVGJH5NUOPVOJEQ,1537312876097,48,True

23,2.0,the front.,"This was ok, but it is cheaply made. It fell apart pretty easily, especially the front. We have had ours a little over a year, and for something that was barely used for two summers it is already a mess because the front is falling off. the grill popped out from the beginning, and when backing up the back trailer gets stuck and doesnt move or flips, so we had to take that off.

I would definitely recommend this if your interested, and I would buy it again after owning it and seeing how much our kids enjoy it. Hopefully it will hold up to the test of time. It's been in use for a little over a month now. Will update this if anything major happens. We have tested out the use of the higher gear and it's pretty quick, which will be great as our oldest gets more comfortable with it, but he's pretty content with the first speed level for now.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEAO2SIWMNBXROPGTZGVMJ5RC5DQ,1498656008025,2,True

29,4.0,One star off for assembly,"I bought this tractor for my 2 1/2 year old grandson.  I have a large property and I thought he would like it to help me garden.  I was pleased when it came to see that most of it was already assembled.  The instructions are annoying...pictures on one page and then you have to flip to another page to see the written corresponding instructions.  That being said, it was not hard to assemble, I did it myself in a little over an hour. A couple of issues I hope to have you avoid...when assembling the trailer, the side pieces have a tab that will slide into the front piece, if you're not paying attention like me, and you have the tabs facing the back of the trailer, they are a pain in the butt to get out again...be warned...  Next, putting the rod in the tires, first you have to put this clawed like washer on and they instruct you to use a mallet to get it to hold...well, I only had a hammer and the damn thing did not hold easily...by the time I got it to hold, I had flattened and spread out the base of the rod from all my banging which made the rod end too wide for the tire holes to be passed through.  With enough banging I was able to bore my way through with the rod but I spent an additional half hour doing it.  Once that was done it was assembled very quickly and stickers were easy to place.<br />The battery: I don't know if they changed the design since I read the older reviews, but you DO NOT need to take out the battery to charge it... I just unplugged the unit and plugged in my charger cord, couldn't have been easier.<br />The ride:  Well my grandson was attracted more to the radio than the tractor, he absolutely loved it!  Once on the tractor, he got a bit nervous.  Even in first gear that bad boy really takes off and on my grave drive I noticed it lost traction more than once.  I will be purchasing a 12.5 inch bike tire to modify and gain more traction.  So on day one he did not do much riding.  On day two, I had the tractor on my deck facing the downward ramp, I followed him and helped him steer so he didn't hit anything and he rode it all the way out to the barn...still a bit nervous as even in low gear it is REALLY fast.  I guess the momentum helped the traction issues as there were none, but I'm still getting the tire to modify it.<br />All in all I'm pleased with the product, I felt the price was fair.  After only two rides my grandson was more comfortable...and keep in mind he's small for his age but was able to deal with the foot pedal although it is the top of the pedal that needs to be pushed down so if you little one is pushing from the bottom half of the pedal you will go nowhere.<br />I give the unit 4 stars because of the tire rod issue and the speed...low gear is just too fast...can't imagine what high gear does (shuddering).  That being said I live on 3 acres and there isn't much trouble that speed will get him into but if you are going to use this anywhere by a road, I hope you can run fast...",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEGKJTQWHGBIOTO34OB3GKIGCN7A,1432563516000,3,True

Of course the front grill falls off constantly just like the other reviewers stated I expected that when buying it though and figured it was something I would fix no problem.  What I did not expect is it to stop working correctly and only go at a crawl even after being freshly charged after less than a month.  My kid is heartbroken he pushed the pedal and is lucky if the thing will make it an inch.  Now it is basically trash I would figure maybe the battery, but at $60 for a replacement battery I am wondering if it would be worth a try.  Either way I shouldn't have to spend an additional $60 to get a toy that is less than a month old to work.  So in my book this is an expensive cheaply made piece of junk.

My biggest complaint is that the “Tune” button on the radio is jammed in at an angle and will not wiggle loose. I didn’t notice it until after I got the stickers on it.

My very patient son stayed up on Christmas eve and put it together, but we started charging the battery that morning.  It is really a nice ride-on, and I was surprised at all the details it has.  A real working radio!!!  I like that the pedal is on the bottom and it looks just like an accelerator.  The battery operated car he had before this had a button he had to hold down next to the steering wheel, so he loves this feature, just had to get used to it.  This has reverse and 2 speeds that are also controlled on the floor by hand just like a real vehicle console.  The trailer comes off which is good for driving around on the sidewalk.  With this extra shift it goes through the grass easily.  I think its well worth the price, and when I saw his face when we unveiled it, it  was priceless.  Highly recommend!!",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEXE24GZOBPBI6EXNZKFE65OCGGQ,1389205843000,1,True

120,5.0,Best christmas present EVER,"My 4-year-old got this for christmas from us, and he is on this thing every waking hour. We have a farm..so he tries to use it for real farm work. Its not really suited for actual work. It can only pull VERY light loads and the hard plastic tires work great on grass but not hard packed ground or over ruts. We are looking into swapping out the tires somehow. it does get bogged down in the field pretty easily, but it's probably designed for 'city kids' that like to think they have a farm.... my kid wants to use it as a real tractor like his daddies.<br />Update: it's now July and my son uses this thing DAILY and when I say uses it... I mean he uses it for REAL farm work, hauling heavy loads, heck... this things never had a lick of issues! I can't say the same for my husband's actual tractor.<br /><br />8 month update: this thing holding together really well for the EXTREMELY heavy use its getting. My ONLY complaint is that I wish it had real wheels and not hard plastic, they have a tough time on gravel or hard-packed ground. The ONLY pieces that have come off are one headlight that bounced off out in the field somewhere and one fender that came off when my son tried to force it through the gate which wasn't open enough (his fault, NOT the tractors).  He uses this thing for real farm work, including hauling bags of feed (shocked!) and when he got in trouble one day my mom rode it in from the field... my moms 5 foot 1, but a grown woman and this thing STILL carried her just fine (Not that I would recommend it !)  This thing works fantastic every single day: Unlike our real farm equipment. *sigh* ONly complaint (other thatn the tires) is that I wish the battery lasted longer... but he does use it for real farm work so that isn't a shock.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51w9dK+zkBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51w9dK+zkBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51w9dK+zkBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AESQWYQWCDMM2ZURBKIMACERTYTA,1557377709666,2,True

140,5.0,"I thought she'd love it, and she does","I bought this for my daughter who is 3 and a half. She is obsessed with tractors, trucks, and just machinery in general. I thought she'd love it, and she does, but she is scared to put her foot on the accelerator, so I'm hoping when she ages a little she will eventually ride it without fear. For now though, she pushes it around like a giant toy car and likes to sit in it and play with her barbies. I'd also like to note while trying to teach my daughter that it is okay to ride and it isn't scary, I tried to ride it myself for an example to get her interested in trying. I am a 5'8&#34; man weighing 288lbs and this thing carried my weight for a few minutes and still accelerated with no problem on the low gear setting. Now THAT is quality! The instructions for putting it together were atrocious and lacked any detail. I had to watch a video on YouTube of two little boys putting it together in order to figure out what goes where. The instructions have no writing, just pictures that are vaguely drawn. But once you realize what it is you are doing for most of the parts it comes with, it clicks in your head just how simple it truly is to put together. Beginning the process without a guide is absolutely an awful and long experience. But let's disregard the difficulty of the instructions since putting it together shouldn't be a factor. I believe the quality of the product should be a factor and this thing is absolutely incredible for a kid in terms of durability and power. I'm still in disbelief that it can hold me, a 29-year-old, 5'8&#34;, 288lb man!

It was a little bit of a challenge to put together, you have to be sure you have everything lined up perfectly before snapping in any of the plastic parts - they are almost impossible to get &#34;unsnapped&#34; if they go in wrong!!  The instructions were clear and concise.  The battery takes just a tab bit long to recharge, but it last longer than the manual claims.  I would like to see the wheels a litte more aggressive, they tend to slip on gravel or in 6 inch grass. None of these things are show stoppers.  I would purchase again if I had another child in the family that would love it as much as my nephew does!

We live in the country and were happy to find a tractor that could ride well in sometimes muddy conditions. We live in south Louisiana, so it is pretty flat out here, but the few little hills we do have pose no problem for this tractor. We have not switched it to full speed yet but I think it is plenty fast enough for a toddler.<br /><br />My son has become an expert driver on this thing and surprises me how well he takes wide turns with the trailer attached. He usually spends his time driving around, picking up woody debris in the yard, and hauling it to the wood pile.<br /><br />The radio is a nice addition. I haven't had any problems with it. Overall, I think this tractor is well worth the money and would recommend it to anyone with kids ages 2.5 to 5 years of age.<br /><br />UPDATE: We took the governor off so he can ride the toy at top speed. It goes really fast! I have to admit that I was pretty nervous at first since my son is only 3 but he handles it quite well.

He zips through the yard in second gear like its nothing, sometimes with his 5yo sister along for the ride.

The wheels do spin a bit on cement  (like the driveway) but have great traction in the dirt and mud.  My little boy has found that he is able to pick up his toys quickly by using the wagon and having the ability to quickly tow everything back to his toy box.  We were worried that it would be made of flimsy plastic, but this thing has survived running over his siblings, crashing into the dog house, being dragged through the mud after it died, rained on, and has carried almost 120 lbs (kids and toys combined) a good 30 ft.

It has held up through numerous sized children (including a 9yr old!) And all kinds of terrain.  It won't go up the hill in our yard unless it is at high speed, the child weighs enough (because it is real wheel drive), and it is at just the right angle, but it does make it so we can't complain!  If there were more traction on the wheels I feel it would do a much better job on the hill because the motor seems powerful enough.  Some people figured out how to rig the wheels for more traction but we never bothered.  This is quite fast on second speed, perfect on first speed for beginners, and pretty powerful.  The trailer works well if you don't misuse it - the kids decided to try to give each other rides in it one year (the tractor was still going strong with two children on it!) and that was the end of the trailer!

We chose this ride on vehicle because my son is tall for his age and most of the ride on cars aren't designed for taller kids.  Since it's a tractor, there is no dash so his knees are free and he fits well in it.  He's driven after it rained so this vehicle has been tested in slushy, muddy, swampy land and it does well on hills in second gear.  First gear isn't strong enough for the hills on Pop Pop's property.  This tractor is also strong enough to carry my 7 yr old niece who is also tall for her age (she has the height of a 9 yr old).  My son mainly rides this at the grandparents house since they have lots of land, but it's actually small enough to fit in the back of my small SUV so we are able to bring it to parks and to friends homes, for play dates.  FYI, second gear is very responsive so since my 4 yr old is new to driving, he has a lead foot so I do want to disclose that the unit rears up a bit in the front when he just plops his foot on the petal.

Contrary to the only other Amazon review at this time, I believe that the tires are accurately reflected on the packaging, perhaps they figured out how to mold a thick treaded farm type tire. I will upload some photos of the tires close up later.  This tractor is great, it is themed as a farm tractor, with a stake-style trailer, as opposed to the John Deere Turf Tractor, which seems to be themed as a Lawn Mower Style tractor.  The Ground Force has a radio, which you can hear in the background of this video, and it is pure coincidence that the country song is playing.  Assembly takes between 1 and 2 hours. The directions were all diagrams with no text, but after completing assembly, I found that in the manual, there are text directions a few pages after all of the diagram instructions.  Peg P. should notate this in the owners manual up front to make assembly a bit easier. It rides very well over our bumpy lawn.  I am sad to say I ordered this from WalMart for $245, I hope Amazon can compete with that price as time goes on.  They have already lowered it from $299.99 to ~ $273.

You send it and the parents get to put it together.<br /><br />Our grandson was roughly 2.5 years old when he got this for Christmas. He figured out how to drive it fairly quickly. The slow speed is a nice starting speed. The faster speed is really nice and fast. I didn't clock it but it certainly seemed to be fast enough. It was faster than the car we bought for our granddaughter but her car was heavier and was a two-seater.<br /><br />It worked as described. The battery lasted quite long.

309,5.0,This is a beautifully styled tractor and better with add-I s.,Our grandson absolutely loves this tractor. He is almost three and it took a couple of times riding around to get the knack of steering. I wish the upgraded more powerful battery would come with the tractor. I plan on purchasing one as a backup. I added real headlights which operate with a rocker switch and got the after market battery operated horn. I got a three pack of bicycle flasher lights which have an elastic strap with Velcro and attached them to the exhaust stack both for looks and to show up for vehicles on our roadway which has scant traffic. I got the idea on YouTube to attach bicycle tire tread on the wheels both to protect the plastic wheels and to provide traction. The plastic tires are slippery and they were showing wear after only three times riding around on asphalt. Plus the bicycle tread should provide a quieter ride. I cut off an inch on each side of the bicycle tires so they would lie flat against the tractor tires and fastened them with 3/4” stainless steel coarse thread screws. Others used coarse drywall screws which wouldn’t show as much but I wanted something to hold up to getting wet.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710LoI1AWkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710LoI1AWkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710LoI1AWkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AZ3aHN4kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AZ3aHN4kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AZ3aHN4kL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HK9RQmqsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HK9RQmqsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HK9RQmqsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JkxyLq1LL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JkxyLq1LL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JkxyLq1LL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQNPYf4XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQNPYf4XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TQNPYf4XL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81k5Ty61qIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81k5Ty61qIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81k5Ty61qIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AHSXK7HD6N3DRZ4MLHXPTILDWCDA,1583592123709,229,True

348,5.0,"A lot of assembly, too many decals, but solid and fun","I was genuinely surprised at the amount of assembly this thing required. Dont get me wrong; I'm not afraid of tearing anything apart and putting it back together again or building something from scratch. I own several custom cars I've built myself, built an airplane with a friend, and fix most things people just throw away. But it was the end of the day, the night before my son's birthday, and I really expected most of the little stuff to be done right out of the box, like lenses on the non-functioning lights and decals on the body of the tractor and trailer. But no, the only thing you *DON'T* have to install is the motors and wiring and controls. The instructions referenced non-existent chrome decals to go behind the fake light lenses and I wasted 15 minutes looking for them. Peg Perego is nice enough to include a spare axle nut to make up for the fact that the step where you install washers on the axle between the wheels and the body were omitted from the instructions. Everything goes together relatively easily, save for the #@%&ing steering shaft... I was tired and lacking patience and getting more irritated as the night wore on, and the decals really ticked me off. There are no reference points or guides on the tractor body, making it very easy to put them on crooked or mis-aligned. And there are a lot of decals. I put about half on before calling it quits. Anyway, my son loves it, and it's faster than all of his friends' ride-ons, which is surprising since it's a tractor. The battery has a nice long runtime, and usually outlasts the boy's attention span. Tires could be designed better, but overall a nice product.

388,5.0,Loads of FUN! I upgraded the battery for more fun.,"[[VIDEOID:da392046a2e5060ce35450c9c60e5d5d]] My son loves this tractor.<br /><br />This design is adorable! All my friends and family compliment on how &#34;real&#34; it looks. Over time my son removed the plastic &#34;headlights&#34; and &#34;tail-lights&#34; and also removed the exhaust on the side as well as the stickers, I don't mind as long as my son continues to use it. It has good steering and it is able to ride through dirt a lot better than St Augustine grass. My son, 3 year old, goes in circles in the backyard and naturally 2nd gear is his favorite.<br /><br />CONS: It is expensive compared to some power wheels. You pretty much pay for the cool look. The 2nd gear drains the battery twice as fast as 1st gear. Stock Battery is small and has less capacity compared to what you get from a power wheels vehicle. Updated 9/1/18 - the motors overheat easily compared to power wheels vehicles. On hot days upgraded battery keeps going until the motors overheat and shut off. After a couple of minutes it runs again.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: I considered upgrading the wheels with rubber liners, but I am sure the extra grip will put more wear on the gears. I also considered increasing the voltage for more power but this will also wear out the gears faster too. So I went with the battery upgrade. I bought a 12V 20AH battery from Amazon and also upgraded the charger to charge it faster. The only downside is that the battery is bigger and its challenging to tie it down. I used pipe strap but I am sure zip ties can also work. Updated 9/1/18 - The motors on power wheels seem stronger than these.

419,5.0,Amazing quality and great for the price!,This tractor is amazing!!! We decided to purchase this one after my daughter rode a friends and we found out it was 7 years old.  The tractor still had so much power from the original battery. It was easy to ride and maneuver for my 3 years old.  With a fully charged battery and my 3 year old weighing 32 pounds she can ride for 3 hours no problem on grass with slight inclines. We also allow her to drive it in our neighborhood while we go on our evening walks and she has a blast pretending to drive all around like a big girl.  The tractor has enough power to make it up small hills but nothing big which is understandable. It actually does better on hills then I thought it would do and has surprised me with the power it has. It has pretty good traction control for a product of this type and doesn't spin wheels where most ride on vehicles do. My daughter loves the radio and loves listening to country music while she follows daddy on his tractor doing yard work.<br /><br />The cons about this tractor are very small.  While putting the tractor together the instructions about which specific screws went where wasn't clear and were hard to understand.  We ended up using a wrong screw somewhere because when we screwed the radio to the tractor the screw went right through the radio opening and wouldn't hold it in place.  We had to get an extra screw to make it work.  Otherwise the rest of the directions were easy to understand with both illustrations and words.  The other complaint I have is the trailer.  The neighborhood kids are always sitting in it as kids will do and the trailer can not hold their weight - it can't really hold much weight at all.  Due to this the plastic part that holds the &#34;axle&#34; has begun to break so we have now learned to disconnect the trailer whenever kids are around to prevent them from hopping on to ride.  It would've been better if they had two sets of wheels on the trailer and a back to the trailer would've been nice as well.<br /><br />When the battery arrived in the package and we put it on charge it lit up green within 5 minutes of charging so I was confused since it said to let charge for 18 hours or until the light turned green.  After calling Customer Service (which was fabulous to deal with) I was told to allow it to charge for 18 hrs the first time no matter what and ignore the light so I did and haven't had any problems!!!,[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AHBT2RXNFYPR6DZMBXOMQNDNM5EQ,1437004272000,0,True

Over rocks, through water, through the mulch, and all over the neighborhood. the wheels are plastic and don't have much tread but somehow he still makes it go over everything.

I'll take it, the others were such a hassle constantly pushing to get them going or toting them back up the hill.

My husband, who is extremely skilled at assembly and building, had some choice words for whoever wrote the assembly instruction. He eventually tossed those, found a few youtube videos, and did the rest of it on his own.  So if you buy this, watch youtube before assembly and don't even bother with the assembly instructions.<br /><br />Once assembly was tackled, we let our son take over and to say it's his favorite toy is an understatement. We were a bit nervous at the beginning as he very quickly went to the faster speed setting, but even at 3 years old, drives it like a nascar driver with zero fear.  We're obviously supervising at all times but aside from one time when attempted to drive it up a hil on our property and the weight distribution was so off-center it nearly flipped backward, hasn't had any issues.  He drives in on asphault and grass and has no trouble.<br /><br />Our only issue is that one of the tires, less than 2 months after getting it, separated along the middle seam. The tires were pre-installed so I'm confident it's not an error on our side.  I'm still attempting to get a response from customer service, so we'll see how the service aspect of Peg Perego goes.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad we bought it.

One thing I wish it had, a handle in the middle somewhere so I can put it quickly back into storage, just about every other part you could grab it from seems like it could break at any moment.

This is because the tractor has so much initial torque that it doesn't gradually accelerate - it just takes off.<br /><br />If you look closely, the plastic tires have a small grove in the center.  Other Peg-Perego models actually have a red rubber band that fits in to those groves for traction - they are called ""traction bands"".  I did some research to fix the constant tire spinning problem and here is the easiest, least expensive, best option (in my opinion).<br /><br />The rear tires measure about 12.75 inches.  I went to the local department store and purchased one 12.5 inch kids bike tire.  I removed each sidewall of the bike tire using the edge of the tread as a guide (I cut it will heavy duty all-purpose scissors/cutters).  I then cut the tire in half directly down the center (first by making a slit with a utility knife, then using the all-purpose heavy duty scissors/cutters to make the cut) - the center of the tire has a mold mark, so it is easy to follow the center.  Then, I stretched each half of the bike tire over each rear plastic tire on the tractor - sliding the tire to the center so that the smallest part of the bike tire fit in to the grove on the plastic tractor tire.  Viola!  The tractor has excellent tractor for both starting and stopping.  A 30 minute fix for about $10.<br /><br />Overall, we are very happy with this toy!  It should last my daughter for many years to come.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AGIRTWES6BG3GHMPNBXOD6HH4GEA,1374583003000,114,True

510,4.0,"Our kid loves it and loves being able to haul produce from the garden, but there are iritating shortcomings","First, just about any kid is going to love this tractor. Ours loves hauling around his gardening tools in the trailer and hauling produce from the garden to the house. I also love the fact that replacement parts can be ordered from the Peg Perego website for anything that gets broken. In this world of disposable stuff, it is refreshing to actually be able to buy parts to repair a kids toy. The fact that this tractor is made in the USA is another refreshing change.<br /><br />The tractor and trailer were not too hard to put together, but I found all of the supplemental instructions to be annoying. My guess is that errors and omissions were found in the original instructions and so supplement sheets had to be included. What really needs to be done is to rewrite the master instructions so that the supplemental sheets aren't needed. This would greatly simplify assembly.  All instructions need to be in one booklet and in a logical sequential order, not spread across several sheets.<br /><br />There are shortcomings with this tractor. The first and biggest annoyance is the radio.  The radio requires its own AA batteries when it should really run off the master battery. To add to the battery frustration, in order to replace the radio's batteries, one must remove the radio from the tractor, which requires removing the steering wheel. All told, replacing the radio's batteries requires removing a bolt for the steering wheel, a screw to free the radio from the tractor and a screw on the battery cover. In reality, the radio is pretty much junk, it has terrible reception for the lack of a decent antenna, it can't stay locked on a single station and every time it gets turned on, it starts at the lowest frequency and one has to find &#34;their&#34; station again. It really shouldn't cost all that much more to have a halfway decent radio that can get half decent reception and stay locked on a given station even after having been turned off.  Even if a better radio increased the price of this toy by a few bucks it wouldn't affect sales. If separate batteries are going to be required for the radio then they need to be easier to replace.<br /><br />The next annoyance with the tractor is that it comes with a slow battery charger even though Peg Perego sells a rapid charger that can charge a battery in around two hours. Instead of making us buy a second rapid charger that essentially results in the charger that is shipped with the tractor redundant junk, the rapid charger should be included with the tractor. The rapid charging could be a selling point for the toy. After all, a toy that is waiting for its battery to be charged isn't much fun.<br /><br />Another wish I had for this tractor, which seems to be a problem for any kids' electric vehicle I've seen is that the battery should be easier to swap out.  To remove and replace the battery requires removing two screws.  If a secondary battery is going to be used to keep the tractor running while a battery is being charged, the battery cage really needs to be held in place with clips, not screws to facilitate quick removal. It is nice that the battery cage will support a larger battery and I will make sure to buy a larger battery as the second battery when the time comes. The original battery does seem to have 2-3 hours of run time if properly charged for 18hrs from the start. In time, like any battery, its total run time will decrease and of course if there are friends over, everyone is going to want their turn driving the tractor. A larger battery will provide a longer run time throughout its useful life.<br /><br />I would have given this toy three stars, because of the annoyances listed above, but added a forth star because of the fact I can easily order replacement parts when they are needed and because it is made in the USA. Being able to order replacement parts is going to give this toy a much longer service life than it would have had otherwise.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MDxD3vOiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MDxD3vOiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91MDxD3vOiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AGJ3AGHIBFG2XWX3FSNJRWVDSIJQ,1504294908947,469,True

520,4.0,Son LOVES it - could be built better,"Our 4-year-old has had a blast on this thing since we got it for Xmas 6 months ago. You need to be a little handy to put it together and directions could be a little more clear. They're almost as useless as IKEA directions. Anyway, biggest issue we've had with this tractor have been with the part that holds the hood lock and the radio. When the tractor goes over bumps, it's enough to pop it out of place. I tried crazy gluing it in, but that doesn't work. So I'll have to come up with another fix. The radio also died after 6 months (being replaced under warranty, but why do I have to pay $10 for shipping?). As far as I know, it didn't get wet. Oh, and they make it very difficult to replace the batteries on the radio. You have to take off the steering wheel and then unscrew the radio panel.<br /><br />I recommend buying a second battery. Why? Because your kid will drive this thing so much that you'll likely be swapping them a lot. But the batteries do last quite a while. Also, if you have a younger kid, I recommend keeping the gear shift locked at position #1 (there is a latch that you screw on to keep it out of 2nd gear) for at least a few months until he/she can demonstrate they can handle driving the tractor.<br /><br />If you're handy with electronics, you can go to Radio Shack and buy some wires, LED bulbs, an on/off switch and battery packs and make your own headlight/taillight system.<br /><br />Overall, this was a huge hit and I don't regret buying it for a second.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEMREXCMOIEI63OA6H63MDC32NLA,1372280367000,0,False

577,4.0,Pretty great but a couple minor let downs.,The Trailer only holds 22 lbs is my only reason for giving 4 stars. I would have thought that my son at 2 years old would at least be able to ride in it however it does not feel sturdy enough or have a good enough connector to the tractor to feel comfortable with him in there.<br />The tractor is 12V with 2 speeds and in 1st speed it is faster than most 6V power wheels.<br />There is a lock out for 2nd speed which I like so younger ones cant shift to it easily and possibly hurt themselves on it!<br />The tires I thought could have been better. I have some other power wheels that have a rubber strip around the center that is great for traction and limits slip of tires and adds padding / cushion if they ride it indoors in our basement.<br />Other than that assembly isn't too bad.<br />My only complaint about the instructions is they could have been written better. The pictures are on one page then ask you to read the pictured instructions 2 pages over.

583,4.0,Safety concers,"This item does not come with a remote.  There is also no on/off button which means that if the child gets on or off the tractor on the side that has the gas petal, the tractor is going to start moving, leading to potential injuries.  There isn't much room on the floor board, where the gas pedal is, so when the child stands to get off the tractor, the vehicle moves. The exhaust stack has a handle on it, but it easily bends and cannot really be used as an aid to get on the tractor, even though it appears to be there for that reason. The stack is also on the side with the gas pedal which increases the chance of children stepping on that side and the vehicle moving before the child is seated.<br />This is the third in a variety of riding vehicles, that we have bought for our grandchildren.

He has had a lot of fun on this so far. We have a dirt field that he rides around in and the tractor has no problem rolling or maneuvering around trees, etc. All and all, this is a great toy.

He’s a work in progress when it comes to steering, which is not hard and just a matter now if age and experience but,  didn’t take long for him to realize standing was an easier way to keep continuous pressure on “gas pedal”, rather than sitting!  I project using it to past 4 yrs old as his sister of that age loves it too. Can’t speak to assembly but my son did not grumble or mention any difficulties. Discounted completely the FM radio as an accessory plus but, grandson loves it and won’t  take off until he tunes in to his favorite station. It definitely runs over grass and up slight grassy inclines, even when they are wet. None of the others we looked at were adept at that. The reviews were spot on—this one works all terrain.  Not pricey when you consider the years of use he will get out of it and that it is sturdy and well constructed. Highly recommend.

It also has a 2nd gear that is locked with a screw so you can take it off whenever your child is ready. We have not taken it off and it still fast enough in 1st gear. It was definitely worth some frustration when my son was able to enjoy it. It's a well made tractor and is very durable.

635,3.0,"Great tractor though it comes with a slow charger, instruction assembly issues, and part fit issues.","Numerous other reviewers have expounded extensively on the pros of this tractor and so I don't want to go into reiterating those in detail other than to state that overall, the tractor looks and functions like a great tractor and my son loves it!<br /><br />However, I want to highlight three points of concern that causes in my humble opinion, unnecessary frustration, and hence my reduction of 2 stars to this product (ideally, I would give it 3.5 stars, but that option doesn't exist). All these concerns are interconnected to a degree and can easily be resolved.<br /><br />- 1. Even though the assembly should have taken no more than a couple of hours (because there were relatively few parts to assemble), it ended up taking around 7-8 hours because two items had issues with fit.<br />--- A. Firstly, the steering wheel alignment with the screw was potentially not well designed (atleast in my order) and it took me 2 hours to get it aligned (the radio mentioned in bullet 2 below compounded the issue).<br />--- B. Secondly, the front hood couldn't be put in initially because one part was not cut out to appropriate fit and I finally realized it only after watching a YouTube video (as the instructions provided in the manual were unclear - more on this later). If it wasn’t for the YouTube video, I would have made a mistake and drilled a hole in the wrong place. I finally solved it by having to cut a hole on a panel using my drill.<br /><br />- 2. The battery really shouldn't take close to a day to charge; this in my humble opinion, is unacceptable because of several factors including the potential risks mentioned by Peg Perego (i.e, pg. 2, Warning point 5: ""During recharging operations make sure the battery charger is in a well-ventilated area” and potential risks posed by overcharging anything in general). I understand that there is a fast charger that can be purchased for an additional $40 which can charge the battery in 2 hours (I purchased and tested it out and it works). However, I wish the fast charger was included with this vehicle and the FM radio which seems like an unnecessary ""luxury"" in addition to being an impediment to installing the steering wheel removed. The only way to get the FM radio out (the FM radio has two separate AA batteries which might require replacement) after installing it is to remove the steering wheel which I do not plan to do for reasons already mentioned. The other option is to slightly increase the cost of the tractor by removing the ""super-slow charger"" and placing the fast charger in lieu of it as I am certain people would be willing to spend a few more dollars especially considering that tractor is a premium product.<br /><br />-3. Some of the instructions in the assembly manual were unclear and ambiguous. Three of the most egregious instances (out of multiple) that cost me an inordinate amount of time include:<br />--- A. On pg. 5, direction 12, they should have mentioned that the trailer was done (first 11 directions were about the trailer). Direction 12 was a new direction not related to the trailer; however, it was not mentioned that the direction applies to the front of the vehicle.<br />--- B. On pg.7, Direction 14, only one image describes a complicated process of putting in the hood. This process is far more complex than this image describes especially because of what I faced (described in bullet 1 of this review).<br />--- C. On pg. 8, direction 30, it was not mentioned that if you are not careful, you can actually screw in the steering wheel ""upside down"" (an aesthetic problem more than it is a functional problem), this is problematic especially because in my case it took close to 2 hours to screw it in only to realize it was upside down and then spending another 1.5 hours to put it back in place (aligning all the parts for the steering wheel is complicated because of the FM radio, pushing a rod in through the bottom of the tractor and holding it in place without it falling back, inserting the steering wheel and holding it in place, all while simultaneously ensuring that the tires are turned so the item can be screwed in).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611Z1x3vyPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611Z1x3vyPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611Z1x3vyPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cb5FFu5TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cb5FFu5TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cb5FFu5TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d2m+QfOLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d2m+QfOLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61d2m+QfOLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gJ8NtANhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gJ8NtANhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gJ8NtANhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEJRVL6ZCBVHSJM4M4J6S7LXFEPA,1646607213431,22,True

The steering wheel fits in the hole  where the shaft comes out of. That hole was way to small and I had to drill down it to make hole  a lot bigger. So they need to enforce quality control.

And could have still fit in the box. In the first gear it moves quick. Once she gets used to it can’t wait to see how fast this can go. Radio is awesome. Not very good instructions.

717,4.0,Great Tractor for Ranch Living,"This is a great tractor! We live on acreage with no paved roads in sight--all gravel drives, grassy hills, rocky slopes, and muddy roads, and rarely does this toy get stuck. It drives on gravel and grass great. My only complaint is I wish the back tires had a rubber tire tread to reinforce its' manueveribilty--these wheels are all plastic. BUT--our son got a ride-on motorcycle for his birthday and that toy doesn't do nearly as well as this tractor on the gravel & grass (had to take the motorcycle to my mom's who has paved roads). My son still rides this everyday and he got it for a birthday present 6 months ago. The added wagon on the back makes him feel he is helping his daddy on the ranch :) and really, he helps his mommy a lot too because you can load that wagon up with things for him to pull that I don't have the hands to carry (like a couple grocery bags or picking up downed tree limbs). The instructions to put it together are...typical crappy instructions, so have patience and beer handy. It's kinda loud when running, but on acreage that's nice because if I can't see him, I can at least hear him if he's close. The radio addition is cool but my son would rather have had functioning lights on the front of the tractor like his dad's tractor. So far the battery life has been great. He rides it for about 2-3 hours altogether each day & we plug it in each night. It's only died out once in 6 months. Overall I'd buy this again any day of the week.

It's the perfect size for him and he will probably use it a few more years before he outgrows it.  He got this for his birthday and his Aunt has already ordered him a little gas pump for Christmas so he can &#34;filler-up!&#34;.  It was worth the price to see the joy on his face.

It also has a reverse gear. This toy tractor comes with a working, no joke, FM radio! Now that's cool! The tractor comes with a pull trailer that you assemble, it holds about 20 lbs of stuff. I would highly recommend this toy. Peg Perego toy customer service is outstanding and very responsive.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81A18CptkOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81A18CptkOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81A18CptkOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AGM5JDMO7L4YGZ7LE5ACJRXHJ6PA,1435131056000,7,True

770,3.0,Defective battery holder and defective charger!!!,"The first tractor I purchased from Toys-R-Us came with a defective battery holder; a plastic part that holds the battery in place under the hood was broken!  So, I returned and got a new one.  The same issue!!  The third replacement had the same issue with a part broken at a different place!!!  Unbelievable!  It is probably still operational without the holder with screws, but it will be rattling under the hood.  At the end, I agreed to take the floor model - the only one with a working, intact battery holder.  The battery holder is poorly designed with weak plastic parts.  I'm afraid that it will break in the near future when the tractor hits a few bumps.  The next issue is the charger for the battery.  It has a green/orange color light indicator that tells you whether the battery is fully charged or not.  This light indicator is always green whether the battery is charged or not.  I called Peg Perego to replace the charger, but they refused.  They insisted that as long as it is charging, it's working although you don't know when it's fully charged... They refused to replace the charger.  A terrible customer service!!  Other issues:  rough stop-and-go, loose hubcaps for the trailer that needed gluing.

838,5.0,Great product going strong months later with heavy daily use,"First off we love the tractor. But it is most definitely 4 wheel drive like it says. It is however amazing. My son has been driving this since his second birthday every day. EVERY DAY. Rain or shine. He has fallen asleep at the wheel on this thing. It flies through mud puddles, over the prairie, in ditches, over small rocks, he's got it close lines on big rocks, running over other toys. This tractor goes and goes and goes! We've had it over 6 months now and there's been no issue with the battery or motor and a single charge can last days. But we try to plug it in every night because we know how long he rides. We also try to bring it in for wet weather but it has lasted through rain and snow without issue. It's not too heavy so if your little one does get stuck it's easy to get unstuck.<br /><br />The trailer initially was a little difficult to lock in place because it's so tight, but after my husband did it several times then it was loose enough so I could do it too. 90% of the time we leave the tractor trailer off because things get complicated with backing up. The radio is an awesome addition too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715613Og8PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715613Og8PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715613Og8PL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bLMLARbbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bLMLARbbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bLMLARbbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AF5VRLMVPH6Q3N5JJJ7HDEDQYJPQ,1441304870000,15,True

The battery holds a decent charge, but we do bring it in every night to charge. The instructions for assembly were a little unclear, but once you figure it out, the actual procedure to put it together is not too difficult. The tractor is fairly durable, although we ended up taking out the engine side panels. They do not stay in at all. And the front bumper fell off within the first week or so. My son has been hauling vegetables from the garden and cruises up and down the yard. One thing to note, keep the trailer attached. If the child starts it in fast gear on any sort of incline without the trailer, they will for sure flip the tractor. It wants to pop a wheely if started in the faster gear. The trailer will keep it from flipping up. We have had in running nearly every day for 2 months and it is still by far the most exciting thing to do during the day according to my toddler.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AH4DGN5IVBL3CL5MTDOIVBSB7Z5Q,1441171939000,1,True

905,4.0,Pros and Cons,"My son is obsessed with tractors, so this was a ideal gift.<br /><br />After looking at it in the garage for 3 months, one day he decided to try it. He never looked back. It's been an extension of his body ever since.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Decent Battery Life<br /><br />Lock out on speed. This thing is plenty fast in low. I haven't tried what high gear will do. I will say low in this unit is faster than high in his friends Peg Gator.<br /><br />FM Radio! On a kids ride on.. Are you kidding me.. Everyone that sees it says Wow!. It only has scan forward/back but still...  I will note the radio uses independent batteries. AA or AAA. I can't recall which. But they've lasted months of him forgetting to turn it off.<br /><br />Decent Customer Service. See con below. While there is a design flaw, their customer service was great. It just seems to be a chronic issue that I gave up trying to resolve.<br /><br />Good traction: After watching his friends peg gator get stuck in relatively flat/short grass I reflected on the places I'd seen our son take this little tractor and marveled. We had 2 tons of sand for a project and it made it half way up a fairly steep pile that was 3 feet tall. Likewise, he drives over a curb in our driveway with relatively ease.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The black front grill. It broke off in less than a day. I suspected a bad tab, contacted Peg, who sent out a replacement for free. They even sent new decals to go with it. However, with a young child all it took was a slight bump and it broke again. He now has a grill less tractor. But he just stores toys in the front part under the hood.<br /><br />The trailer could be a little better designed. It does not have a back gate so things get strewn all over the yard. I will say that it is light which helps when he backs up and jack knives. II assumed it would break the hitch in days. However, the trailer is light enough and the hitch strong enough that I've seen him back it across the yard. The trailer just hops and skids as he goes. He bugs me to put it on and take it off. Which isn't hard, but isn't kid friendly either because it's a tight fit.<br /><br />Assembly. I was a little surprised at how much time it took to assemble. There were alot of the smaller parts that I would have assumed pre-assembled that weren't.<br /><br />ALL IN ALL EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AGZHEGDUUBS6HS2XTDITIDRRBOLA,1374202541000,4,True

We had the wrong railing sent to us, and we contacted the manufacturer and had another one sent to us right away. I only gave it four stars in durability because the piece that the engine hood hooks into broke fairly easily. It still stays shut so it hasn't been much of a problem. Our property is pretty uneven and a little hilly and this tractor has little problems navigating around in the slowest speed. Love the two different speeeds and optional lock out feature.

930,5.0,Awesome Little Tractor for Kids.,"This kids tractor is awesome.  I bought this for my son right before he turned two and he was pretty shaky with it at first.  He could press the pedal to make it go forward, but he couldn't steer and going in reverse was not happening.  So a lot of time was spent awkwardly bending over and moving forward at the same time steering for him while he pressed the pedal.  Well now that he is 2 years and 4 months (6 months of practice) he is an absolute pro.  He can steer with a lot of precision and he definitely knows how to use reverse; just this weekend he was riding it and was about to hit a tree, he simply pushed the gear shaft forward in the reverse mode and stepped on the gas to go backwards.  We actually removed the governor this weekend so he could go &#34;fast&#34; in second gear and wow.  My wife and I were amazed and also shocked at how fast second gear was.  It is borderline not safe how fast this thing hauls; I honestly can't stress enough how fast this thing moves.  We will probably put the governor back on so he can't put it in second gear for a few more months until he has mastered the steering and actually listens to us when we tell him don't drive down the steep hills or by the end of the driveway.  The battery really seems to last a long time which I love.  I also modified the tires slightly.  I bought small bike tires, cut the curved sides off of them so I was left with a fairly flat rubber circle.  Then I boiled a big pot of water, poured the water into a five gallon bucket and through the tires in there for about a minute.  This made the tires soften up so I could easily bend them around the rear tires.  Now the tires don't spin out every time he presses the pedal and provide much better traction.  For the price you really can't beat this thing and my son is obsessed with it; would definitely buy again.<br /><br />As far as cons: I agree with other reviewers.  The battery for the radio should be much easier to change out; i.e. you shouldn't have to take off the steering wheel to get to it.  The assembly definitely was a pain in the butt as there are a ton of steps.  The hood is a little tricky to lift up, but if you get the little screw in the general vicinity it needs to be you can just pull up with a little force and usually get it.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AECP5BUYG6QC5ZAEXBNBR2CAMALA,1500306912158,23,True

933,4.0,"Great toy, but my child is to young to understand how it works.","This is really a neat little tractor. While it is made out of plastic I think it's sturdy enough and well made though not perfect.  I wish it had a horn, and a key with working key switch.  I would rather had it make realistic tractor sounds and done away with the radio.  this is why I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />We bought this for our 22 month old son in the hopes of using it as a deterrent to keep our son from climbing all over the real tractor  and not get hurt.  This idea kinda works...he does still climb on the real lawn tractor but he gets off and goes to his toy tractor that he says is &#34;mine&#34;. It also allows him to play inside the house whenever he wants instead of crying at the back door to go to the shed at 6 am on Saturday morning for a ride on the real one. This is worth it to me.<br /><br />Lastly, I think our child is just too young for this type of toy both physically and mentally.  Since he's just 22 months old and the manufacturers recommended age of 36 months and up. (We found several other websites saying 24 months and up)...regardless we thought since we were trying make a safety decision we chose to purchase it anyway.  I read a ton of reviews on this before buying it and a lot of people said their child was having a blast on it at only 1 and a half years old.  I have found and observed that my son is just not ready for a toy of this type. He's too short for the pedal.  We velcro-ed some scrap wood blocks to it but not helpful since he clearly does not have the concept of &#34;push-pedal-make-truck-go&#34; and he's not strong enough to actually steer.  Forget trying to use reverse at this age.  so I would say maybe in another 6-12 months and he will understand how this toy works and maybe he will start to enjoy is much more.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEZRXDRCZJVWD4NDQSWEF6SWZIWQ,1404843759000,0,True

940,2.0,was probaly a quality assembly at one time..,"It's clear that many of the snap features are no longer working like they should and the plastic tooling that makes them needs to be repaired. I had to use a screw driver to snap a number of components in that should have just pooed into place. I even needed to belt sand the plastic of the steering wheel to allow it to go together properly. I also was not provided the reflective sicker for the tail lights that the instructions reference. Don't know if this has been intentionally eliminated or just was missing from our box. Not that is a big deal weather the tail light reflect a bit more light it just wasted 15 minuets of my time as I dug through ever piece of the box twice.<br /><br />The battery life is really so so. On flat land it could probably keep going for a good 30 to 40 min but if you have any hills the battery life gets chewed up significantly fasted. The frustrating part of that shorter than average battery life is the charger is very slow so you wont really get to use it again for a few hours or till the next day.<br /><br />The radio will never work. Don't even bother installing it unless you like having your kid complain constantly that its not working.<br /><br />Last, never don't attach the hood fully with the twist catch. I left it unlatched because in 40 minuets i know I would need to [plug it back in but a big gust of wind cam and cough the hood and ended up ripping it right off.

954,3.0,Not tough enough,"We bought this for our three year old 4 months ago. It rides well, but the plastic body is not tough enough to last a fairly active bunch of kids and rougher terrain. We have a yard that is not flat, our front area is gravel, driveway is bumpy, our grassy area filled with trees, that is to say it is not driven on a suburban lawn.<br /><br />1) The first week we had it the plastic hook that attaches the trailer to the tractor broke.<br />2) The second week the front grill fell off.<br />3) The body that covers the battery has a small plastic button that was difficult even for an adult to twist and would not always 'catch' to close. As you have to hook the tractor up to the power source every night after use, the kids ended up not bothering to close the top cover. And the plastic cover is so flimsy that it wobbles and is now cracked.<br />4) Our yard guy tried to move the tractor by holding the smoke stack, which I know is user error, but as he lifted it the smoke stack broke off.<br />5) The steering shaft has become unscrewed a few times. It goes back on easily, but it would be better if we could rely on it staying in place.<br />6) Most of the stickers have peeled off.<br /><br />Even though the tractor doesn't look great now, my kids still ride it all over our property. So the motor does it's job.<br /><br />Yes we have been tough on our tractor. But for almost $300 I would have expected it to be more sturdy.

962,2.0,Disappointing quality,"I was really excited to get this for my grandson.  It arrived yesterday and the first thing I noticed is that it appeared to be already partially assembled.  Two glaring issues was the piece where the hood rests on.  It was hanging off only being held by one screw. I took it all off and am attempting to put it back on. As you can see in the picture, the fastners that the screws go into were spinning on the screw and off the base. I'm hoping I can use some glue and put it back on.  The other thing we noticed is that one of the side panels appears to have been bent(see picture). We were able to put it in place without issues.  It also had screws missing.  Thankfully, I have all kinds of screws so I was able to improvise.  I don't know if this was a return and the company did not bother to quality check it before sending back out as new, or just bad quality control.  Either way,  the tractor feels cheap and plasticy(it's a word).  If after a few days, of use, the tractor(drivetrain) itself works ok, I'll come back and add a star to this review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61llcf0k-EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61llcf0k-EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61llcf0k-EL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UtPl4cojL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UtPl4cojL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UtPl4cojL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AFZ7YHNAUSV2H7RVHEV3P6JTD5GQ,1598118818404,0,True

1003,5.0,Highly recommend this tractor!,"We love this tractor!  I bought this Peg Perego tractor for my grandson in 2018.  He was a bit young for it but with mom and dad next to him he soon mastered it.  My kids live on a ranch and this tractor got a lot of use.  My grandson rode this over all sorts of terrain hauling hay, rocks, and cats.  We had to replace the battery and tires, but I think that was due to use and not manufacturing.<br /><br />I think it has two speeds, but the grandson only knew ""fast"".  Even on fast though he was not out of control and we could easily catch him in an emergency.<br /><br />This year we bought two more for the other two grandkids.  The style is somewhat the same by my son-in-law pointed out that the front of the tractor is better fitted and won't disconnect from the frame as easily as the last one.  Not that it was ever an issue, but it is better fitted now.<br /><br />As stated, I had to replace the battery.  I could not order online, I had to call customer service.  But the experience was great and the product arrived with no issues.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Assembly is not easy, as others have said read the instructions and have You Tube available.<br />2. Lastly, we got the Peg Perego two-seater a few years ago and we did not have as great an experience.  My daughter said it did not hold a charge as well as the tractor.

The battery charger really didn't do what the instructions said so I called the Peg Perego customer service. The lady was very polite but the response was basically no help. She told me that there were 2 types of chargers and I got the old one and that the chargers really never tell you when the battery is fully charged.  Here again the instructions are very confusing and contradictory. They tell you to charge the first time for 18 hours and that the light will be solid when you start but flash when complete. However she told me that won't happen and that when the tractors begins to slow down re-charge the battery. Anyone would know that !! In other words the charger tells you nothing! They never offered to send a new charger or the second version she mentioned. For a $300.00 toy tractor you should at least get a charger that tells you when the battery is fully charged!

1030,5.0,Great Tractor  - rides on Tough Terrain,"This tractor was a Christmas gift for my then 2 year old son.  We bought this after him having a Lightning McQueen battery operated - because he liked to drive in tough terrain and that car sat too low.  We live on a lot of property, with a huge pasture.  My son is able to drive this tractor EVERYWHERE!  It has good power with the 2 speeds (he only drives in 2nd speed) - and has reverse as well.  It has been a work horse! He hauls rocks, sticks, and yard trash in the trailer, and it has worked out well.  It is hard to back up with the trailer on (just like it would be for a car!).... so we try not to back it up with it on as we saw the wheels might get bent.<br />We bought an extended life battery for it, and he is able to drive it for much longer now.  When he has managed to get it stuck in a hole, he can push it right out.  This is a Fantastic gift for a child that wants to test the terrain and explore bumpy, lumpy areas. My only complaint has been the front grate kept falling off because you have to open the front to get to the battery. I am sure my son probably crashed it into something to start the issue... but after it fell off while he was driving it - and he ran over it - it doesn't stay on anymore.  5 months into this toy - he uses it every single day.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AFMJWLKZ7GHW4MPMUI35IC5QZR4A,1303907234000,13,False

1065,2.0,Worked great... at first.,"Okay, so my son is VERY tall for his age. He's 4 but looks 7. I did a lot of research and landed on this tractor because of the size and voltage. At first, it was great and I was impressed with the strength and speed this thing had. My son was straight up off roading, popping wheelies and whipping donuts. That only lasted about 2 weeks however and then one day, the back tires didn't turn anymore and the motor was running at half speed (if that). It was constantly getting stuck and slugging along. For the price I paid, definitely expected it to last longer than 2 weeks. On top of that, it arrived with a broken trailer and a missing tire. Customer service was good about getting me replacement parts, but definitely check everything in advance if this is a Christmas or birthday present because that whole process took about a month. Another important note, this thing was a massive pain in the butt to put together. I was extremely frustrated by the instructions and eventually just used the picture on the front of the box and managed to get by with that, but hated that whole experience. As I mentioned above, THERE IS A HUGE PICTURE ON THE BOX!!! The Amazon delivery guy delivered it straight to my son who saw the picture and immediately knew what he was getting for his birthday. All around, wish I didn't waste my money. But my kid did have fun for 2 weeks, so do with that what you will.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AFGN3FKD7WXCZNQI6II3L5FHKO3Q,1670072740148,1,True

We purchased this after reading the reviews and figured, like most people, the ones with the bad reviews are just too picky.  Well, this toy is a complete waste of money!  My son LOVES it, so much he drives it around without the hood on, battery exposed, and doesn't mind when he steps down that the plastic bends.  Yup...the hood broke day ONE. It is a very cheap piece of plastic.  it actually has broken into three pieces (or have come apart I should say)and we have ducted taped them back together multiple times because our son loves it so much and would be DEVASTATED if he couldn't ride it.  BUT, now it won't even go on because the inside piece fell off.  We have given this ride-on 2 months and two rolls of duct tape! I am SOO appalled by this product I can't even give it one star (zero was not an option).  We have purchased new tired for the jeep through amazon, and are now replacing the parts on an old jeep for him.

He got right on and we couldn't get him off!  Now just have to teach him to steer. This tractor is extremely cool, well built......and it has an FM radio that works great and gets 10+ stations!!!  Once his older brother (5) had a chance to ride we set the speed to 4 1/2 MPH which he loved.  Wouldn't recommend starting 2 yr old out on high speed.  4 1/2 MPH doesn't sound like much but on pavement it travels pretty fast.  This was well worth our money!

We have been out a few times to use it so far and have let him drive it on the first speed, which is enough for now as he gets used to it. The first time he was a bit frustrated that he couldn't just figure out how to drive it but has picked it up quickly and can steer it himself. My husband got a kick out of the radio, my 3 year old could care less about that feature though. My father-in-law put it together and said it was really easy.

The tires get no traction at all and is quite frustrating.  I’m going to need to do the bike tire fix for them.  A variable speed control or at minimum a soft start function would be a great upgrade as well instead of full on or full of like a $10 remote control car.

Son doesn't care and it's not effected to use of the tractor and it makes it easier to charge! It's pretty quick also.

1164,4.0,Great Toy With a Couple Mods,"I've had this tractor for at least a year now.  My grandkids love it, but I did make some modifications to get it where I wanted it.  The extras I bought were:<br /><br />Battery Tender 021-0123 Battery Tender Junior 12V Battery Charger<br />EnerSys Genesis NP12-12T - 12 Volt/12 Amp Hour Sealed Lead Acid Battery with 0.250 Fast-on Connector<br />Razor Wire Harness (bought only for the connectors, you could find a cheaper setup out there)<br /><br />I modified the battery cables so you can easily connect/disconnect right to the battery.  This involved cutting the blue connector off of the battery top, cutting the connectors off of the wire harness, and hooking them together with electrical tape.  I also got rid of the half-size battery that came with it, and modified the gas pedal.  It's a mean machine now!  I have never run out of a charge with the full-size batteries.<br /><br />The gas pedal stopped working for me after a little use.  The replacement I ordered also stopped working after short use.  It has two relays (switches) built in.  Both of these switches have to be pressed in order for the tractor to go.  With the pedal being long and flexible plastic, the pedal starts &#34;flexing&#34; and both switches don't always engage.  One day, my grandson was driving and it just stopped working (he was pushing hard on the pedal, too).  Since the tractor was under warranty, I ordered another gas pedal.  It wasn't too hard to install and I only had to pay shipping to get it (service was good).  However, it didn't take long before this pedal did the same thing.  There's nothing worse than your kid driving it to the park and now you can't bring it home.<br /><br />So, I made a modification to the pedal.  This next mod won't be recommended by Peg-Perego, but it works if yours stops working as well.  I reduced the gas pedal to just one switch (don't have to engage both to run now).  I haven't had an issue since bypassing one.  Take off the gas pedal and you'll see three colored wires connected to it and a red jumper.  Remove all of the wires, including the jumper (I threw mine away).  Just lay the blue wire (thermo protector) under the pedal, you don't need it.  Your two switches should be free of any wires at this point.  Take the red and white wires and connect them to the two adjacent terminals on the top switch (with the most space between them, not the two terminals right next to each other).  Oh yea, I removed the metal screw in the gas pedal as well.  That's it, now when they press on the gas, it only takes one switch to make it go.  To recap, one switch is no longer used and the other has the red/white hooked up next to each other.  Just experiment a little, you’re not going to hurt anything.  Check out the schematic in the front of the manual if you’re unsure.  You have to complete the circuit, of course, and the blue wire is normally open to run.<br /><br />I have well over $300 in this setup, but it is a pretty cool toy.  If the gas pedal worked a little better, I would probably give this five stars.  You have to keep the big kids off of it as they tend to get a little rough, it is just a plastic toy.  I got rid of the wagon, too, you can’t back it up with it on there.  They can move right along in 2nd gear, faster than you can walk.  And the working radio is a neat add-on.  Theisen’s sells Peg-Perego as well.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AFSVKQ5VCIJHMKIC4Y46FUF3ITXA,1409608929000,6,True

A phonecall to Peg Perego quickly put us in touch with a helpful and polite customer service rep who, after a bit of diagnostics, sent us out a replacement set of motors.<br /><br />I don't yet know if this will fix the tractor, or how much longer these motors will last than the originals. Either way, I find it worrisome that such a simple product (battery, a couple of switches, and a pair of electric motors) could fail with less than an hour of usage. This was unexpected of such a highly rated product, and I hope it isn't indicative of further quality issues with Peg Perego products. Friends with similar 12v ride-ons from other manufacturers haven't reported any similar issues.<br /><br />UPDATE: The replacement motors arrived but failed to fix the problem. Customer service is only open M-F until 5pm, so I will have to wait until I can call and begin the tedious diagnostic process again. What a waste of time...<br /><br />UPDATE #2: After an exchange of e-mails, Peg Perego decided to send me a replacement gear shifter. It arrived in the mail today, and after swapping it into the tractor.....nothing. Still doesn't work.<br /><br />I put in ANOTHER phonecall with Peg Perego, and after a bit more diagnostics, they think I have a bad battery.

Battery life is better than what I expected, given some of the reviews. He drives it on grass, hottop, hills and flats with no problem. Of course, noticeably more drain when going up hills.Because he is 2, he needed some help with the concept of steering. An adult walked beside him and showed him. He had it down in a couple of weeks! Still on 1st gear/speed setting and probably won't go to #2 until next season. The only reasons for 4 instead of five stars: No rubber tracking band on back wheels like some kids trucks have; and the wagon axle only clips on and I worry that it will wear quickly.

1196,4.0,This tractor is great. My son loves it and both of my ...,"This tractor is great. My son loves it and both of my kids ride it. The trailer is a good option but we have taken it off and left it off because it is difficult to snap on and off. I'm afraid of breaking it. Also, another reviewer said that they had a child riding in the trailer but in my experience, it's hard enough for the tractor to go with an empty trailer much less a light load. It also looks like it will snap off every time the tractor gets put in reverse. The max weight for the trailer is 22lbs. Now that the trailer is off, my son can ride much easier.<br />In first gear the plastic tires have awful traction. There is a lot of difficulty getting it to go up a slight incline.<br />Regardless of all of the above, we are very pleased with the tractor because my kids love it so much. It has already gotten a lot of use and the included battery has yet to run out during use (we charge it per manual instructions).

1275,2.0,So disappointed to be so disappointed ☹️,"So very disappointed. This is not our first battery operated ride so I have some 12 volt Power Wheels to compare it to as well as 6 volt vechiles. I am so disappointed to have to write a bad review for this b/c I was so excited that this John Deere tractor was exactly what my son wanted and it was made in USA (2 star rating),and didn't mind paying the extra to get it, BUT I just don't want others who have kiddos fascinated with John Deere tractors to waste their money. Keep researching and hopefully there is another one out there. This is all the down sides I have found so far. The plastic used to make this is extremely flimsy not like the dune racers that we have two of. I don't expect it to last long before cracking and breaking. The exhaust pipe will not stay on and the trailer bed/railings are constantly popping off. The pedal to make it go is in the exact spot where you have to put your foot in order to get on it to ride so it is automatic that the pedal will be pressed and tractor will take off before child is properly seated. The battery life is pitiful compared to our power wheels batteries. It takes 8 hours to charge and then lasts for 1 hour at most. If it is used for less time than that and then left until next day, battery is dead. It horrible, terrible, the absolute worst I have dealt with and with the frequency of having to charge battery it is the poorest design to assess it. You must remove 2 screws and a large plastic piece that holds battery in place then once battery is charged replace it, the large plastic piece which has to be positioned just so over battery and both sides of fenders, then replace both screws. This is an endless process that is much more simplified in all the other models we have had. Like I said, so disappointed to be so badly disappointed in this. I wanted to love it, but it's just not happening. And last but not least, the directions to put together are horrible, luckily I have experience putting together at least 5 other battery powered vehicles so I had experience to rely on.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEMLJOHHI73BFL2ZV7ZQ5KTQVSOQ,1586899641224,6,True

The quality has been amazing. My boy has rode this with the trailer attached since last Christmas. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. He loves it so much. It is worth the money. You and your child won't be disappointed. I promise. I must have read reviews on different ride ons for 3 or 4 months before I decided on this one. And I'm hoping my honest review then and now will help any parents this year trying to decide to buy this or not. We haven't had one problem or issue with this at all.

1338,4.0,One of the Better Purchases for My Son,"My son is 3 and just can't get enough of this tractor.  He pasticularly loves riding it nearby while I cut the grass with our ride on mower. He pretends to be &#34;helping&#34; daddy and it seems to make him very happy. He also &#34;helps&#34; me transport firewood from our bard to our home. In fact, he can't seem to stop helping daddy in one way or another with this little tractor. It has been worth every penny unlike other toys we have purchased.  Battery life seems to run about an hour before my son needs to &#34;gas up&#34; and daddy carries it to the garage to plug it in. If my son stays on the paved area of the driveway he seems to get about 1 1/2 hours of ride time. Riding on the grass uses the battery much more quickly. Watching our German Shepherd follow along as my son drives around a pasture adjacent to our house is just priceless for memories. It is too cute.<br /><br />The only downside I would warn people about is the tires.  They are wearing down noticeably after only 3 months of use. I don't think they will hold up very long and am going to have to figure out some way to rig up some rubber or maybe canvas to the wheels to prevent them from wearing down to the point where they are no longer usable.  When my son hits the &#34;gas&#34; on the paved area the wheels spin for a moment causing more wear though.  Tire issues are to be determined for me, but anybody considering a purchase should at least be aware so you can make your own decision. As for me, I am considering purchasing another immediately for my newborn to use when he gets older. I'll find a way to keep the tractor running as long as it brings my boy smiles.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AHG7OZB6KQEG5PSYS3PZZY4YYE2A,1397077910000,2,True

1447,2.0,Amazing little ride on toy with a defective battery,"My son loves this new tractor ride on toy. Everything is obviously made put of plastic but seems sturdy enough and it wasnt hard to put together, probably takes about 45 mins all together. I love the 2nd speed option to go faster specially for a 3-4 year old, there is no remote control so I dont dont why the page mentions that (unless mine is missing one). Either way I wouldnt need it. The only thing I am currently posted and concerned about is the battery life. The first time after charging it, they battery later way lo get than any other ride on toy my son ever had and that got him super excited,. Unfortunately after the second charge the battery only gave us 1/2 the riding time and I am hoping that I miscalculated the time, i am charging it a 3rd time and will time it compared to the second, hoping this battery didnt come out defective. Also, I noticed their batteries come with a special enclosure and charging connector so you cant just go out and buy an ordinary chaper battery at your local auto or battery store and to me that's all great since it makes the toy a lot more original, however I would expect a lot more able better for such product. Will update review after the next couple of chargers.

He had to practically take the whole tractor apart to find the problem.  The power wire to the accelerator pedal module was not connected  properly!  The red wire was never even seated into the wire harness! And therefore the tractor would not go. He rewired it correctly and then the tractor worked.  Just a total screw up at the factory!  Also the trailer pin will not work and it won’t stay on. It looks like it was just not formed correctly and so the trailer just bounced off.  We had to find a bolt and washer and nut to replace the defective plastic pin.  My granddaughter  loves it now that it’s running. BUT we are certainly not happy with the quality of this tractor.

Two driven wheel with decent traction for hard plastic means the kids have more options than being relegated to sidewalks (nonexistent in our neighborhood) or driveways.<br /><br />A higher ampacity battery and faster charger would be wise additions, and I'm glad the radio batteries are short-lived due to my daughter's inexplicable penchant for blasting talk-radio.

If you can look at pictures and follow 2 pieces of paper you'll be able to put this together. Took about 2 hours just casually building it. The radio reception came in fine and that sucker is pretty loud for the little speaker.  In The video it barely turned up.  Can't wait for my kiddo to get to using it.<br /><br /> I'm going to take the advice of  previous reviewer(s)  and find some bike tires and zip them onto the tires to save the plastic. Also the rear ""flashers"" and ""headlights""  have a little hole behind the plastic piece you place in so I'd love to try to rig up a toggle switch and find some small LEDs to put in those holes.

1552,5.0,My son is in love with this! Are few downsides but still an amazing toy your child will love!,Let me just start off by saying my son is in love with this tractor. I got this for my 3 year old sons birthday this year and he does so well with it. I think he would have done well with it even on his second birthday. It has a lock to where I could prohibit him from going into the second gear which is the fastest. It has 2 gears. Level 1 and level 2. It also has reverse which he does well with also. Let me tell you Level 2 is fast! I'm talking I don't know if I've ever seen a kids toy go that fast before. But It is perfect for my 3 year old because he loves fast and yet it seems very safe for him to do. Also the steering is great. Also the battery power is amazing for a kids toy! About an hour and a half on the fastest level. He is rarely on level 1 but I'm sure it would last for hours. Now there are a few down sides. It can be difficult to open the hood to charge. But it will open if you know what your doing. It also does not take too long to charge in my opinion. Another downside though is that it is made of mostly plastic. Even the wheels are made of plastic. I could imagine it would be hard to get around in tall grass. We keep ours fairly kept though so we never have a problem with that. Even though it is made of plastic I think It is still a nice buy and seeing how much my son loves it is priceless to me.

Thankfully, it didn't take that long and after a full charge, it was ready and waiting.  Since Christmas morning, my son has been on this tractor every day.  The trailer usually gets left behind, because he wants to go faster.  He is large for his age (wears size 5-6) and it looks as if the toy was made for him.  A word of warning, though, because he likes to shift from reverse to second gear fast, which will pop the front tires off the ground briefly.  It only surprised him the first time, since then he enjoys showing off.  The only drawback I have noticed is that the battery seems to be discharging faster now, with a recharge needed around naptime in addition to the nightly charge.

Also, the latch the holds the hood in place is very temperamental and falls off all the time.  We usually just let the hood rest unfastened on the latch.

1719,5.0,Best present!,"This was a Christmas present from 2014 for my 2 year old.  He's now over 3 and it is still a daily favorite!  Second gear was reserved until he got the steering mastered (took a month or so bc he was just 2) but now he has the freedom to choose his speed.  He loves cruising in second gear, which is quite quick- faster than my speed walk!  The trailer is detachable and easy enough to do.  The steering and breaking(removing foot from gas) is responsive.  It's tough as it has been crashed into things on purpose and shows no damage.  And it's fun!  Even I can drive it if I have to park it in the garage or something... Or race my son around with him driving his smaller, crappier quad!  FYI I'm approx 120 lbs.  Long story short my son loves it and I'm happy with its quality and safety as well!

The first is the wheels. I know that need to be light to increase battery life, but the minute he accidentally steers off the driveway pavement he gets stuck in the grass. The plastic wheels have no traction. This is fine if he stays on the driveway, but I wanted him to be able to drive around the property. We have lots of grassy hills and I worry about the safety.<br /><br />The second factor that made me give a 3 is the trailer. It is not attached and I really wanted to use it.

The battery holds a charge well, and is good for many hours of use.  Our grandson is almost 4 now, and we have bought a backup battery which we keep charged.  Now that he is a little older, we have shown him &#34;2nd gear&#34; -- which allows the tractor to go faster.  That seems to use up more of the battery charge, and after a few hours of 2nd gear, we have to swap out the battery.  (That may be simply because the original battery is almost a year old and has certainly given us excellent service up to this point.)

Our little guy can reach the pedals and can make it go, but it will probably be a few months before he can comfortably drive it.  I think by summer this will be his favorite toy.  It doesn’t have a remote control feature, but does have a safety feature where he can only ride it in the lowest gear for now.  I can’t speak to battery life, as it is still very new.

1957,3.0,Great Toy......Horrible Product,"This tractor is a great toy!!  This tractor is a horrible product!!<br />I have purchased approximately 500 items from Amazon; this is the first I have ever written.  The reviews for the Peg-Pergo John Deere Farm Power were very helpful when I was deciding what to purchase for my 3 year old son’s b-day.  I hope to return the favor.  The tractor is a great toy in that my son loves it.  It is, without a doubt, the best gift he has ever received.  It is a horrible product due to the fact that pieces started falling off and/or breaking in less than a week of using it.  For the price, I expected it to be fairly durable.  I was wrong!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />*  Son loves it, he has to play with it everyday<br />*  Safe<br />*  All four tires are very rugged, not the “slick” tires that was mentioned in a previous post<br />*  Trailer is a great accessory and easy to take off/put on<br /><br />Cons:<br />*  The front headlight housing and the clip that holds the hood down fall off multiple times/day.  This is unacceptable.<br />  If I pay $300 for something, I expect it to stay intact for longer than a week.<br />*  The assembly instructions are the worst I have ever tried to follow.  The step-by-step visual instructions (all pics) starts on<br />  page 2 of the owner’s manual.  The step-by-step text instructions start on page 10.  Why separate the two?  When<br />  assembling, I had the text instructions on my iPad the visual instructions from the provided manual.<br />*  Installing the steering wheel was horrible.  I spent as much time on the steering wheel assembly as I did the rest of  the<br />  tractor.<br />*  Put the stickers on FIRST!!  You will save yourself a lot of headaches if you do.<br /><br />if I had it to do over again, would I still buy it?  Yes, even though it falls apart everyday, my son absolutely loves it.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AHMSVMAGKP2SL7FBAT3LUYPS3FPQ,1370926975000,2,True

1967,5.0,Takes a licking and delivers on the fun,"We bought this John Deere ride on tractor and trailer for our first grandson when he turned two - a few months too soon.  It was easy to assemble, except for the steering wheel which is a little tricky. His little brother was born about that same time, and two years later we bought him a matching tractor and trailer.  Both tractors are still running great.  These are by far the best toys we’ve ever bought.  They’re ridden for hours at a time over a rough backyard, with the trailers piled high with stones, sticks, toys and dirt.  They can be recharged in 3 to 4 hours but we usually do that overnight.  The tractor exhaust breaks off quickly pretty quickly when the kids yank on it.  No big loss.  The only design issue is the trailer chassis. It takes a pretty good beating if the boys carry heavy hard objects,  but it still lasts a year or more.  In time, the chassis pegs wear out and the trailer comes loose from the chassis.  Where the wheel axel snaps into the chassis also wears out. However, both problems are resolved by getting a replacement chassis ($10) which snaps right on. Note: 2nd gear is too fast for younger inexperienced drivers, so keep it locked out until they’ve had time to get comfortable.  The tractors are very stable, but a  two-year-old could easily fall off if they took a turn too fast.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AHIZ533JHDYZKQQLCYMG2NDWEVAQ,1633808004737,0,True

I wish had rubber tires instead of plastic for better traction but only real complaint<br /><br />Battery-  when full charges lasts about 2 hours in 1st gear.  If 2nd gear used last about an hour<br /><br />Offroading-does amazing at our farm.  Check of the video has great power goes up and down hills no problem.  Goes through some snow and standing water but obviously not anything too deep.<br /><br />Charging-  we have both regular and bought fast charger.  Fast charger charges Iin 2 hours bur I've heard if you alternate the chargers it kills the battery.  Unsure if this is true.<br /><br />Radio- runs off 2 AA batteries however yo replace you have to take whole steering column off which is annoying.  Radio gets okay reception.  Wish just had up and down scan button versus up and reset.  Reset starts at beginning and my 2 year old will push it constantly.  When it resets it gets static<br /><br />Overall great product.

I was a little disappointed that the manual did not identify which of the various size screws went where but I figured them out and very close to completion I found a separate sheet of paper with pictures showing what fasteners went where. Several sheets of paper accompany the manual. Look at them all. The battery is going through its initial charge right now so my 5 year old(today) hasn’t driven it yet. I’m a 73 year old retired engineer and have assembled many items for my children and now grandson. This is one of the better ones.

2062,1.0,Poor quality and defective - buy at your own risk,"This toy is very cheaply made and putting it together is a pain.  First thing I noticed when taking it out of the box was that the seat was missing the left armrest. That should have been my warning to put it back in the box and return it. If a company's quality assurance is so bad that they cannot see an armrest literally missing from the seat when they put it in the box, that shows a lot about the quality. Since it was my son's birthday the next day I decided to continue putting it together and just call support to try to get a replacement armrest. Being an engineer I typically have no problems putting things together as I'm careful to follow the instructions. I have to say though that these instructions were horrible and very difficult to follow. Once I did get it together (don't even get me started on trying to get the steering wheel bolted on) and tried it out I discovered that the ""R"" gear made the tractor go forward and the 1 and 2 gears made it go in reverse. The manufacturer had wired it incorrectly.  I was ultimately able to trace the wires to the two motors and switch the wires on each. That fixed the problem. I wonder though how many people that purchase this will have an electrical engineering degree and be able to make such repairs. Other than that, I found the radio buttons do not work and it won't pick up any stations so it is worthless. We have a battery operated pickup from another manufacturing that has a radio on it and it gets quite a few stations so I know that it is a problem with the tractor's radio.<br /><br />Back to the armrest - I called the support number provided but they told me I needed the order number that was on the pick ticket (and not the Amazon order number). They said it should have been in the box (it wasn't). They couldn't therefore help me. I ended up having to pay $17.00 plus $10.50 shipping to get a new seat for it.<br /><br />I will say my son does love it (as he loves anything John Deere). The tires do not have very good traction as he spins out every time he starts off. The wagon is cute but very flimsy so you wouldn't want to put much in it for fear of breaking it. We haven't had it long enough to determine the battery life. I'm assuming as flimsy as it is that it might be broken by the time the battery starts to wear down.<br /><br />If you plan on buying this, I hope you know someone with an electronics degree to help you fix the wiring and are prepared to pay extra for the parts they forget to include and you will eventually have to replace when they break because of their poor quality!",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AGSPSZQNT22RDG6YXQRATKCYZDVA,1641661796717,2,True

I was amazed at the traction it possessed and the areas it was able to get through.  I was for sure I would have to drag it out of areas but he just pushed the gas and went.  The tires on this one are great for getting around uneven ground and up and down hills.  My son picked the forward/reverse up fast.  The speed adjustments make me feel better so he doesn't go to fast now and we can bump it up as he becomes a better driver.<br />Assembly took about an hour, and this was with my son begging to ride it right then =)  Adding all the stickers took almost as long as putting it all together.<br />It takes 18 hours for original charge but battery has seemed to keep a good charge.  He has rode it about 8 hours now and it doesn't seem to be slowing down any.<br />I love having the radio as much as he does.  Nice to have it when working in the yard.  It picks up as many stations as a car radio.<br />I would highly recommend this tractor to anyone who is looking for one for their child.  It is more than some of the others but I can tell it is built to last and have loved watching how excited my son is every time he gets to ride it.

The only problem we encountered were the wheels. To help them move over any terrain, my son-in-law put duct tape around the back wheels and this made a world of difference.

2181,1.0,"Unsafe braking feature on any hill, enough to scare my child from ever using this again!","We've had this toy for nearly 6 months, and at first we used it mostly on perfectly flat land with good results. Once we began to use this on small hills, we noticed two major, unsafe problems.<br /><br />First, in the slow mode only one tire drives, allowing the drive wheel to lose traction, which results in the tractor losing traction and dangerously rolling backwards or sideways with no braking in other tires.<br /><br />Even worse is the ""automatic braking"" feature. In the direction of travel, the braking stops the tractor on level ground but doesn't stop with enough force to stop the tractor when on a downgrade. When traveling uphill, if the child lets off the accelerator, the tractor has no reverse braking function and lets the tractor enter an uncontrolled backward roll that the tires are unable to stop once moving if/when the accelerator is re-applied due to the tire's poor traction. My child took a spill and was nearly injured, and now will no longer use this toy.<br /><br />It is a nice design with good intention, but I am forced to give this a 1 star review because it is inherently unsafe anywhere other than perfectly flat ground. With an age rating of 2-7 years, this should be considered a safety hazard and needs to be recalled. I am considering reporting this to the consumer products safety commission. I would appreciate a response from the manufacturer.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AFCWALG4ZKD3NYK55BVWP7FO7EOA,1543688683785,25,True

2238,4.0,Great power,"My grandson loves this tractor. It was easy to assemble, and has great traction. Our yard is hilly, so the battery only lasts a little over an hour. I would seriously recommend buying an extra.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AGZNI2ZD4PZPPYG22HAMABLQ3K6A,1539044956608,0,True
2239,4.0,My kids love it! Unfortunately,"Purchased this about a year ago. My kids love it! Unfortunately, the battery goes pretty quickly when driven in 2nd gear. This is pretty powerful. I have even driven it when putting it away and I am a 125lb adult.<br />The trailer is okay but not very well built. The hinge part is so week that my kids broke it only a couple weeks after owning the tractor. It's just very weak and flimsy. We don't even use the trailer anymore.",[],B002PEGT9U,B07XL99QKQ,AEODCQD7JJUG5TJ74KCA6OIWBIPQ,1445398247000,0,True
