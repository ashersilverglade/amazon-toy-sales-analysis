2,5.0,"My Foldable Vaca Drone ""HS 720""","[[VIDEOID:61f52fe954b9387d0799a4276217dbef]] Great Beginner or Experienced Drone operators with camera and video that pivots downward a full 90 degrees give the pilot great views and options, one fault is it's not on a gimbal but at this price point it can be expected.  Super quiet brushless motors, 1 battery and usb charger,  nice controller. Comes with decent quality carrying case that stores everything perfectly,  along with a zippered compartment area, where you can keep the manuals and spare props, yes you get a set free with the drone!<br /><br />Flies well in the wind I put it up in winds that were around 15-18 mph and it handled them well, of course  the advertised  battery  life suffered and was only about 17 minutes but it was fighting the wind the whole time. On a less windy day it was almost 24 minutes of total flight time!<br /><br />If your looking for a drone to learn on at a decent  price point this is a good one and it's the right size, this is my 3rd Holy stone drone and I'm pleased with the product, I own the 700d, 270, and now this bad boy.  All the features like follow me and point of interest  work as expected  I have yet too use way points on any of my birds, but the WiFi connection  and FPV work well too.<br /><br />I bought this one too go on Vacation with us in April to florida, mostly because  of its footprint and portability, it is a little smaller than the 270.<br /><br />Eventually I will be spending a ton on a DJI Mavic pro as I want to have a drone with autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance, but these drones have  definitely  exceeded  my expectations and well worth the $$$ spent  and are a great addition  too my 7 other flying machines I have!  So I highly recommend  this unit!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613W7zARAZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613W7zARAZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613W7zARAZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KdKFN8+uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KdKFN8+uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61KdKFN8+uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719mdW6ZEJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719mdW6ZEJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719mdW6ZEJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-YMkLgUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-YMkLgUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-YMkLgUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-YMkLgUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-YMkLgUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-YMkLgUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d2gKLWMVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d2gKLWMVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71d2gKLWMVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ucJAcSn5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ucJAcSn5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ucJAcSn5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91K3nq4Z40L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91K3nq4Z40L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91K3nq4Z40L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFFMDKZR6FTFVMUPNCKNRUKSOJSA,1572103013210,0,False

6,5.0,What a great drone!,"I had written to Holy Stone prior to buying the HS 720 just to get more information and they were extremely helpful. My HS 720 4K drone arrived and it was almost too much to have to wait to charge the battery. I had watched a number of YouTube video reviews on this drone so when I read the manuals it was a breeze. I have an aviation background but have never flown a drone before. This Holy Stone was made for beginners but has the feel of more than a toy. On my first flight I had very few problems and the ones I did have were operator error, not the HS 720. The good news is that while learning, if you go through all the preflight procedures, and you get worried about your drone just let go of the controls and it stops, hovers and waits for you. I even flew it out of range and lost the signal and got really worried until I saw it coming back to me and then I took over once more. The Return To Home feature is worth is weight in gold. The camera was clear and photos were nice. I would highly recommend this HS 720 to anyone and especially a beginner, but it is capable of doing most everything you need.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEYXBJA6E5FCFJT4CEVNEAR627OA,1593527486367,0,True

Next was the testing, I don't think the 720 needed testing as much as I did and I am pleased that I passed and have been up and flying 3 times. Surprising how fast 25 minutes go by.

23,5.0,Fantastic!,"The. Holy Stone HS720-4K is hands down the best drone I’ve even owned. They really stepped This is a great drone with fantastic features normally found in drones used for the commercial marketplace. This drone has never let me down, with a simple (RTH” return to home button it simply comes back to you if you’ve lost sight of it or just want to let it do all the work. Also this drone came with spares, not just a few extra propellers but an entire set! If this is the future of the company, they are going in the correct direction.<br />I love that it comes in a semi hard case, the drone is completely protected and the case is easy to store. The remote is comfortable and even fits my large hands with gloves and fits my iPhone 12 without removing its case. The display is easy to read at a glance and very accurate. The joysticks and buttons are layed out well.<br />The “first setup setup” before flight was extremely simple, I went from out of its case to flying in less than five minutes. It surprise me when I was flying in a light wind, 5-10mph with no drifting. The adds claim that you can fly for 26 minutes, so far I haven’t timed it but I still haven’t flown long enough to kill the battery on the first flight. So far I couldn’t be happier, it’s the first product that not only does what it’s advertising but exceeds it.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFFG3UG7JW7VIRT6DPQY4AFO3C2A,1609798617431,0,True

Wanted nothing to do with that. Then a friend said he didnt have to do that, so I repurchased it. It flies extremely well (I used to fly RC aircraft) and has some wonderful features, such as return to base - which was accurate only 1 in 4 times. I had a 3 ft by 4 foot landing pad in the grass - I had to control it those other 3 times to get it on the pad)<br />A couple things which are not mentioned in the instructions - the distance and altitude units are not mentioned. I am guessing it was in meters, but dont know for sure. The range of my signal (with a brand new phone) was 130 units until the video image was lost. The drone was still controllable.<br />The worst thing about the drone was the video imagery. It broke up frequently even at 12 meters(?) distance with a clear line of sight. It was intermittent and really wrecked some video I was taking. It may be I have a bad antenna or loose connection on the drone, I dont know. Considering returning it again, but will check with HolyStone first as I do like the machine.<br />One other thing I would like to see as an option (maybe it is) is the ability to change camera lenses - its a wide angle lens and I would like perhaps a 2x lens if made.<br />Overall, for learning, its a great machine.

But because I was a beginner I was concerned about safely and storage of its Li-Pol batteries.  HS batteries with the drone are expensive relative to others so quality is not the issue.  But neither in it’s Amazon listing, nor website or printed literature could I find data on how to get to storage charge and how to discharge.  And that was a deal breaker for me because Li-Po batteries require good handling and storage.  And I would have rated this product four stars easily if it was not for the apparent limitations of the charger that while good did not allow for a storage charge or discharge setting and I did have an automatic landing due to low battery that really was not low which also made me question the charger/battery arrangement.

55,4.0,Nice drone by Holy Stone but buy an Amazon extended warranty for it,"It tells you lots when a company only provides a 90-day warranty for their top of the line $400 drone. If you are going to purchase this item, you definitely want to purchase the Amazon extended warranty. My dilemma was that my drone decided (I'll use that term) to stop communicating with me just outside the 90-day warranty. It worked flawlessly up to that point. Images and videos were outstanding. I was about 25 feet up when it suddenly rose on its own to about 50 feet and flew into a tree near us. It wasn't windy, and it was in a location where I had flown dozens of times before. I was holding the controller, not touching any of the controls. Company support reps were kind enough to spend time with me on troubleshooting this issue, but in the end said, sorry it's out of warranty, the board is bad, nothing they can do, but you can have 20% off on a new one. At that point, I decided that I will never buy from Holy Stone again because I don't think they actually believe in their own product. I flew the unit the other day and will continue knowing that I'll have to spend at least twice as much if I want good support. When it crashes and burns, I will go better. It is probably one like DJI that offers two exchanges within a year, with an optional 2nd year if the first year doesn't use both exchanges.<br /><br />UPDATE: Holy Stone contacted me and sent me a new HS720 4K. Unexpected and I appreciate it. I'm improving my rating, but I recommend that anyone purchasing a drone, purchase the Amazon extended warranty, checking the details first.

I hated it - it was too light, and even in the lightest breeze it wouldn't control easily -<br /><br />THEN I got the Holy Stone drone!  What a difference!  This is a really great product.  The self start instructions are very user-friendly and easy to understand.  The drone works great and is weighted enough so that it doesn't blow away lol - Plus that, I like the idea of the propellers folding in, so that it's more compact when not using it.<br /><br />My only feedback on a kind of negative is that the propellers show up in the video as you can see from the example I uploaded.

86,5.0,Great Drone !!!,"Let me start by saying hats off to holy stone and there line of drones. This is my second holy stone drone and could not be happier I started with holy stone with my 120d great drone by the way. My son was really interested in learning to fly drones so I ended up giving my hs120d to my son which needless to say I needed a drone now for myself so I ended up back on amazon and I was surprised to see the hs720 new drone from holy stone so just like everything I compared all the specs with other drones in its class and let me say this the hs720 was very comparable to top of the line drones that are much more expensive so I figured seeing how I was satisfied with my previous experience with holy stone I would go ahead and order this HS720. Let me say that I am very happy I did its an awesome drone that does exactly what I expected it to do and some. Firstly the drone came with a very durable carrying case that holds drone, controller and extra batteries way cool that I did not have to purchase that. When I opened it up I was very anxious to fly this baby so I quickly was able to look through quick guide to learn how the drone operates and calibrate it etc. Was able to have the app downloaded and drone calibrated in about 5 mins. Now that the drone is calibrated I was ready to test this drone out I was able to hit the take off button and it went up about 5 feet up and hovered very steadly considering it was a little windy out. I flew it about 100 meters out with no issues with wind so I decided to bring it up and send it out a little further I had it close to a mile out with the FPV going and no issues quite amazing for the distance I had it. After about 20 mins I heard my controller beep to let me know it had 2 bars left of battery and an about 4-5 mins later here comes the drone hovering over my head from where I took off from how cool is that I was able to fly my drone out of my sight an it knew to come back when it had low battery.  As far as design of this drone it was built solid not cheap plastic which I was also impressed with I honestly think that's why it handled well in the wind. So far this is my go to drone lately when I want to get good pics/video it has a crisp picture and pretty steady not as shaky as most drone videos are. It has a slot for sd card to record all your pics and videos so I was able to record some awesome footage and watch it on my smart tv in 4k. My overall experience with this drone really has been great and only complaint is I wish the controller was rechargeable but I was able to fix that with buying my own rechargeable batteries which on the controller it shows the battery life of controller and the drone so that way I know when my rechargeable batteries are ready to be charged which is great instead of guessing when its time to charge. Very easy drone to fly so its good for the rookies and the pros I am hard person to impress and I admit that but like I said I could not be happier with this purchase thanks holy stone I look forward to doing more business with you in the future.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFBGB2E4F6QXBBY22KOIB3I7QXFA,1570824108621,27,True
87,5.0,Great drone with a lot of nice features,"I chose a day with a steady 8-10 MPH breeze and found that it provided a little challenge to keep it hovering over one spot.  But it flew great.  I had flown RC aircraft a few years ago and found this drone much easier to control.  I have had numerous contacts with Holy Stone and they are very supportive and encouraging.  I think that part of their mission, other than profit, is promoting the expansion of drone enthusiasts.  Since this is my first experience flying a drone I cannot speak to other manufacturers products, but I would highly recommend the Holy Stone HS720 4K drone for ease of use, customer service, and providing a great product at a reasonable price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wHdtB7g5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wHdtB7g5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wHdtB7g5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFBSQETNXK5J2DFG6KYI3VVQ2ZDQ,1597872313626,0,True

Anyway I sent it back without giving it a chance. Now I have another one with instructions and the set up was simple step by step. The drone works great.

89,5.0,It's a good place to start,"I've had no problems from box to flight with this unit.  My first flight was on a semi windy day, about 9 mph winds.  It did handle pretty well, and stayed for the most part in one place.  I do like the camera being a 4k.  The software for the phone downloaded well, however I'm still not able to use certain function on this app.  I think it's due to my Phone's model Moto G.  But I'm able to view the flight through this app.  I would recommend finding apps that helps you with the drone weather.  This will help in determine whats a good day to fly.<br />My first drone I had a few years ago ended up in the trees.  This flight went very well.  Note, the higher you fly the more the drone tends to drift.  There's alot of wind you can't see the higher you get, give your self plenty of room.<br />I think this drone is going to handle what I'm looking for.  I was able to log into the faa.gov site and register this aircraft, and I looking forward to getting my drones license.  At this point you don't have to this, but these regulations are coming.  It's also best to get on the faa.gov site and look over the Drones regulations as well.<br />A question I had to HolyStone, they answered back fairly quickly.

Major drawback is the stability of the camera.  Quite jiggly.  Every time drone comes to a stop; camera wobbles exceedingly up and down while drone is stabilizing itself.

Great customer service. Thank you HOLY STONE<br />I wrote the review below when I first bought this drone. Have to do a update review. The drone was working great and then just fell out of the sky.

116,5.0,Great features with exceptional customer support,"I did a lot of research on the $200 to $700  drones going on sale for black Friday. I found the Holystone HS720 on Amazon with a cyber Monday deal. After much reading of reviews and watching videos on YouTube especially one from ""Captain Drone"" l decided to go with the HS720. It has features that are usually seen on drones that are twice the price.  It's advertised run time is 26 minutes. I have not flown it that long yet. It takes good pictures not as many camera options as the dji but at half the price it's good enough. The camera can remotely tilt 90°, allowing you a variety of angles.<br /><br />It uses GPS and has an assisted  Intelligent Flight function to help you supposedly never lose your drone. The drone should automatically return to you whenever the battery is running low or when the signal is lost. I have heard of some fly always but the customer service reps have been replacing the drones. If you go online to the Holy Stone groups on Facebook you will soon learn that Holy Stone customer service is exceptional, which is a very important feature to me.<br /><br />This is my first drone and I am very happy with it.

119,4.0,Easy to use for beginner and fun.,"After a false start with the HS700 model (it did not work) I got this instead.  I liked the packaging with included box but came to realize that it is not convenient because it is only large enough for the included accessories and nothing else.  I've purchased an extra charger because the included one is so slow and I've also acquired three additional batteries for the same reason.<br /><br />Also, the shape and construction of the charger is awful.  There is no way to lay the battery flat on a surface and attach it securely to the charger.  The only option is to line the parts up delicately and place it in a location where it won't be disturbed because the slightest disturbance will disconnect the charger from the battery.  I am 3D-printing cradles to solve this problem.<br /><br />As a beginner with no experience (with UAVs - I am a Part 61 pilot of ""real"" aircraft) - I cannot compare this to other drones.  I can report that it is easy enough to learn to fly but there are plenty of gotchas that can creep up on the inexperienced operator and the included manual is spartan, only covering basic operation.<br /><br />My biggest concern and warning to users would be to check the propeller screws for tightness after about each hour of flight time.  They work themselves loose, something I learned the hard way and was fortunate enough to discover during a takeoff when a propeller separated from the drone.  Given my experience with airplanes, I should have thought of this myself, but I didn't. This should be in the instruction/maintenance manual.  I would put Loctite on the screws but I plan to replace the blades regularly as they get worn from occasional mishaps.<br /><br />Beyond that, beware the return-to-home feature, how it works, how its parameters can be set and under what circumstances it is initiated and how/when it can be disabled.  Think through the implications carefully.  Failing that, never fly the drone when the battery indicator is below 3 bars, or if you do, only fly it near the ground within a very short distance with no tree canopy.  Google around on this.  'Nuff said.<br /><br />The Ophelia Go app does not run on my main phone.  It gives no clue why and there is no good reason for it.  I suspect the SW has code to do a rooted check and they don't disclose this but I have not investigated further.  This is annoying, but the positive side is I can leave my main phone connected to the Internet while the dedicated flight phone is using the drone as a WAP and is thus offline.<br /><br />I've tried the orbit mode and the snap to path mode and they seem to work but I haven't use them extensively enough to comment further.<br /><br />Also, I purchased a pair of Firehouse Arc 2 strobes to velcro to the front (white) and rear (red).  This is extremely helpful in assuring I have visual confirmation of the craft's location and orientation at all times.  Prior to installation, I would sometimes momentarily lose sight of the drone or become unsure of its orientation amongst visual background clutter.  The strobes eliminate this problem.  This also increases visibility for others, airborne and otherwise.  I think all drones of this weight should have such strobes integrated.  It's annoying to spend $60 for a pair of blinkin' lights but necessary in my opinion.<br /><br />Finally, I attached reflective tape - red on the left side and green on the right for additional safety.  It is only slightly helpful at close range, but not really necessary.<br /><br />As to competition, I've found a seemingly comparable drone at a slightly lower price that actually includes a 3-gimbal mounted camera.  Nevertheless, I'm happy with this purchase and the photos and video I've gotten are OK with the simple shock absorber/dampening system of this device.  This is only a toy and a learning experience for me.<br /><br />And my cats are only slightly wary of the craft.  A neighborhood dog lost its mind and I had to land it so he would calm down.<br /><br />UPDATE: The Ophelia Go app does run on my rooted main phone. I apparently missed a warning prompt about not having Internet connectivity in earlier attempts to use it. AOS warns the user about this after connecting to the drone WAP and the user must explicitly accept the condition before completing the connection.  I think I missed this because the prompt times out.<br /><br />Also, I took off yesterday by using the throttle only with no pause to a fast ascent. The craft started drifting off position dramatically and my attempts to control it led to amplified oscillations leading to a crash. I suspect that sensor calibration - possibly compass - was somehow knocked off by my method of operation but I really don't know why it happened and it is very concerning. I await a spare part to replace a broken propeller arm.<br /><br />I also ordered a XIMI X8 SE 2020 because I'm hooked and I want to get some stable video. I tried image stabilization in post-processing but the results were unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, the HS720 has produced some interesting and useful videos for me.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lMb+ClCtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lMb+ClCtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lMb+ClCtL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gAaeFi2QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gAaeFi2QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gAaeFi2QL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BejTAY4PL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BejTAY4PL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BejTAY4PL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGSNQM65LBXKDTLGWUUSZ7DKW5VQ,1600192733474,20,True

121,2.0,Cool beginner Drone comes with nice features and extras (RTF) - quality issues,"This is my first drone. I had been holding out until i could find nice features at a decent price and i think this is it. I used to fly mini RC planes for a few years but got tired of the hobby and was running out of places i had room to fly.<br />The drone rekindled my RC interest with the features, price and limited space needed to fly.<br /><br />The drone has many auto features that are very handy. The auto take-off and landing is nice to have when your new. I didn’t trust it at first so I did both myself but when I used it it handled the job well.<br />The noise level of the drone in flight isn’t bad. If you get this about 20feet in the air you don’t hear much of it so you don’t have to worry about this drone attracting a lot of attention.<br /><br />The camera quality is ok. This is something I would like to upgrade at some point. However for the price I can live with it.<br />The FPV camera transmission is a a second or two behind reality so be aware of that when flying that way.<br />The drone flys well. Responds to input well and is easy to control, even in small spaces. If you fly this in small spaces you wont get to enjoy all the features.<br />The extras are a case and controller.<br /><br />A couple negatives about the drone. THe app has crashed on my IPAD pro while recording/transmitting but I have recorded on my iPhone for a full season with no issues so I would say the app is 100% reliable at this point for all devices.<br /><br />I’d recommend  This drone to other new comers. Just read the instructions and make small movements on the controls. You’ll figure it out in no time.<br /><br />Update: after owning for a week and flying daily I started to notice the fpv range on mine is shorter then listed in the manual. I can only get 100m before it drops out and 125m before it is total gone. Make all the app controls almost useless.<br />Went flying yesterday and almost immediately after I launch the drone (used safe lift-off button) the drone wanted to fly away on me. Not like wind moving it but control inputs were wrong. Constant forward and to the right drift. I would counter on the controls and after 20 seconds it seemed to work properly. I enjoyed the rest of the flight no issue for the whole battery. Went out this morning and same issue after lift off except this time it really pulled forward and to the right. I tried to increase altitude to see if I could get more space from the ground but it started to speed away on me. I hit return to home and it started to turn but went down at an angle very fast and crashed. Not sure why it seems to get lost like that.<br />I did buy 2 of these drones, 1 for me 1 for my son. His doesn’t seem to have this issue at all. He also gets double the fpv range on his hs720 @ ~300m.<br />I think something was up with mine from the beginning not sure if a component failed or something was damaged in shipping.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFP7SPRQZUGTVM5TJ5EAYRYEBKBQ,1577052791066,11,True

However for the price I can live with it.<br />The FPV camera transmission is a a second or two behind reality so be aware of that when flying that way.<br />The drone flys well. Responds to input well and is easy to control, even in small spaces. If you fly this in small spaces you wont get to enjoy all the features.<br />The extras are a case and controller.<br /><br />A couple negatives about the drone. THe app has crashed on my IPAD pro while recording/transmitting but I have recorded on my iPhone for a full season with no issues so I would say the app is 100% reliable at this point for all devices.<br /><br />I’d recommend  This drone to other new comers. Just read the instructions and make small movements on the controls. You’ll figure it out in no time.<br /><br />Update: after owning for a week and flying daily I started to notice the fpv range on mine is shorter then listed in the manual. I can only get 100m before it drops out and 125m before it is total gone. Make all the app controls almost useless.<br />Went flying yesterday and almost immediately after I launch the drone (used safe lift-off button) the drone wanted to fly away on me. Not like wind moving it but control inputs were wrong. Constant forward and to the right drift. I would counter on the controls and after 20 seconds it seemed to work properly. I enjoyed the rest of the flight no issue for the whole battery. Went out this morning and same issue after lift off except this time it really pulled forward and to the right. I tried to increase altitude to see if I could get more space from the ground but it started to speed away on me. I hit return to home and it started to turn but went down at an angle very fast and crashed. Not sure why it seems to get lost like that.<br />I did buy 2 of these drones, 1 for me 1 for my son. His doesn’t seem to have this issue at all. He also gets double the fpv range on his hs720 @ ~300m.<br />I think something was up with mine from the beginning not sure if a component failed or something was damaged in shipping.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFP7SPRQZUGTVM5TJ5EAYRYEBKBQ,1577052791066,11,True

It definitely worked better just flying it alone and not attached to the phone. I think other wifi networks mess with it so it's less responsive.<br /><br />Anyway, this was BS how this happened. I'm a pretty decent drone pilot, and usually fly free mode drones, this is my first GPS drone so it's super easy to handle. It worked great yesterday for one flight after the battery charged. Worked for one full battery today... then just now not even 3 minutes into my flight and I'm bring I back down to land and it decides to just flop over upside-down causing the damage seen in the pic. less than 24 hours it took for this thing to malfunction. Hopefully they fix my issue for me.<br /><br />Edit* they sent a brand new drone free of charge.<br /><br />Edit again* the free one they sent only connected the GPS once, hasn't connected since and hasn't been able to be flown at all. I've been so busy with work I've only tried a few times to troubleshoot, but solved nothing. Just get an Exo Drone or save up for a DJI, the extra BS you have to go through to get something that works isn't worth a free anything.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1aX99iMcfS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1aX99iMcfS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1aX99iMcfS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEE47BVB7C7FKCUO54JTTZ5F44YQ,1618014269959,0,True

154,3.0,It is a $250 Drone - Remember That!,"This was my first drone purchase.  I was so excited and impressed with the concept of aerial photography that within two weeks I upgraded the drone for a better quality camera drone.  During that two weeks I managed to crash the HS720 several times and one crash critically damaging the drone.  I replaced the HS720 with another one and around that same time my upgraded camera drone (Mavic Mini) arrived and I started flying that one exclusively.  The HS720 did not get much (if any) flight time.  So it was stored away fro several months.  When the Mavic Air2 was released I purchased it and then that drone became my primary and still is to this day.  I do fly the Mini from time to time and often fly both the Air2 and the Mini at the same time.  Especially when doing sunset shots where the drone is hovering stationary.  Recently I offered the HS720 to a friend for a vacation weekend use.  I figured I should reacquaint myself with the Holy Stone drone and the Ophelia app.  After flying the DJI drones for nearly a year it was extremely difficult to go back to flying the HS720.  I have flown the drone extensively these past two days to ensure I could at least answer a question when posed by my friend borrowing the drone.  As other reviews have stated, this drone is not very stable in flight.  Hovering is generally a 3 to 5 foot (1-1.5 meters) affair as the drone refuses to be stable when hovering.  The controls are very sensitive.  When directing the drone to go backwards if the joystick is at all anything back directly pushed back the drone will go off in side way directions.  You have to be very careful flying this drone and have plenty of open space for it when the controls do not do exactly what you were intending.  The past two days I have nearly crashed the drone several times.  Don't get cocky!  Is it a bad drone?  It's not horrible, but it is no DJI that is for sure.  But it cost $250!  It's not going to be a DJI drone.  Is it a good drone?  It's not great, but it is relatively good (3 stars).  It is a decent beginner drone, but for a ""beginner"" drone it is very difficult to fly with confidence.  I tell you I really struggled several times in controlling the drone.  Be patient and don't do quick movements with it until you become very proficient.  Fly it in LOW mode!  Keep it within site and if you panic as you are about to hit something - remember what I already said - fly it in wide open space!  So if you buy this drone, fly it carefully and cautiously.  I really believe that 99% of crashes are pilot errors and not the drone's fault.  Although drones can have a mind of their own as well.  Even my DJI Mavic Air2 decided to take a 200 foot (60 meters) nosedive one day for no apparent reason - destroying it! (Thankful for DJI insurance).  So buy it, fly it for a while, then upgrade to a higher end drone like the Air2 and you will be amazed how much easier it is to fly.  Best of luck with your drone purchase and enjoy the hobby.

It comes with a case, charger, battery and controller.  The case is a nice extra since I have had to buy cases for other drones.  I don’t know if you can beat this drone for the price.  It is very easy to fly and performs as Holy Stone says.  We use drones to video tornadoes and I can’t wait to try this one.  It’s small size but good power should work well.  I have already flown it in some pretty good wind but not what we will put it through.  It has very little to catch the wind with no landing gear.

All said this is a great little drone with many features found on those that cost more.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615sFqjwLvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615sFqjwLvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615sFqjwLvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617WCZBA-IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617WCZBA-IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617WCZBA-IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gpKANm39L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gpKANm39L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gpKANm39L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEIUOFHTI4YCUBBJLJTJQUCHAZCQ,1569793058453,0,True

It was extremely easy to learn to fly, and the quality of video images are nothing short of incredible!<br /><br />My plan was to buy this unit as an eventual throw away to learn with, and then move on to a high dollar unit.<br /><br />Thing is, why would I? This thing is a blast to fly, and it is free from the restrictions and requirements of the larger, heavier drones. This isn't a commercial class done, but it feels so much better than any ""toy class"" drone that I have experienced. The video imagery is breathtaking, and unit is highly responsive, with smooth flight and transitions. I'm honestly hoping that Holy Stone is working on their next quad copter product. The HS720 is amazing, but from what I see with this company, they will continue to develop and design the most amazing products for the consumer.<br /><br />Thank you Holy Stone!!<br /><br />Update: I had an incident caused by local interference.

The pictures it takes have a purple hue to them and are very very digitized looking. Not to mention the propellers showing up in the photos and the fish eye effect. The video is shakey due to a two axis gimble. There is no way it is recording in 4k either. It shows a lot of ""jello"" and pixelization. It just doesn't look good.<br /><br />I researched more about DJI and ending up getting a Mavic Air Mini. For the price difference I felt it was the better choice for me.<br /><br />The HS720 isn't a bad drone. It is very capable and flys well. Distance is questionable and we as the picture and video quality for me.<br /><br />I was looking at picking up a new one for a bit...I had previously purchased a pretty inexpensive one for my daughter for Christmas a few years back. In the hopes she would use it more than me...well...I used it more than her and was looking for something more substantial.<br /><br />I had looked at the more expensive brand (DJI) my neighbor has one and they are very nice...however...I'm still new to the game and didn't want to drop that much on something that I need to learn more about. I came across the Holy Stone HS720. I read the reviews, watched the video reviews. Saw videos and pictures the drone has taken and I decided for the price and everything it offers this would be the one...actually it was between this and the HS270...I decided since it was my birthday the HS720 was it!<br /><br />I took it out for one flight yesterday and it performed pretty well...it was too windy to do much of anything else, but it handled well and did what I wanted it to do!

The maiden flight didn't goes as well as I thought it would due to MY error. :/.<br />The Holy Stone HS720 is a top notch drone with many things to learn. With repetitive flying that learning curve will diminish. I absolutely love flying the Holy Stone HS720.<br />My only dislike is the connection between the Battery and USB Battery charger. It's kinda like the charger just sits there and I've found a couple times where the charger had fallen out of the Battery.

200,5.0,"Great drone, spend the time to get familiar with it before you get ambitious!","This is a great, easy to fly (for a drone) product, although it's susceptible to being moved by even light breezes. While I was learning to fly it, I left it hovering in front of me while I was looking down at the controller. The wind blew in into me, which was really painful. But that's operator error, and not the drone's fault. Lesson learned!<br /><br />Setting up and pairing the controller was easy. The controller has a mobile phone mount, which works well, although I had a bit of trouble getting the phone app set up properly. The QR code in the instruction book downloaded the Ophelia GPS app. I couldn't get it to work with my Galaxy S9 phone, but the text referenced the Ophelia Go app, which I downloaded manually and worked great.<br /><br />This is a well made small aircraft, but definitely not a toy. Spend the time in an open, still place with lots of room (not inside) to get to know the controls and how the drone responds before you take it into the real world!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHGWQWOZ42TWXAA2IN476222BORQ,1594565080110,0,True

But what makes this an exception 5 star review is that Holy Stone made this right by getting me a replacement in less that 48 hours after contacting them.  The customer support rep on chat (Roxanne..LOL) was exceptionally polite.  They are obviously working out of China as the hours of operation are 5:50 pm PST until 1200 pm PST.  Her English was close to perfect, she was patient, prompt and POLITE.  I cannot say enough good about this company.  Their product is exceptionally priced for the amount of features.

Foldable arms and carrying case make for a compact package that is perfect for grab and go.  Be sure to pick up a micro SD card because the HS720 drone’s compact size and convenient carrying case will mean more flying opportunities and great quality images at locations that might otherwise be missed.  The HS720 is lots of fun and I look forward to many enjoyable hours of use.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGZGLSS2DEHF4QKCHBXYBZO64QAQ,1579146151974,0,True

252,5.0,customer service/a good drone,"I reviewed a number of drones and settled on this one.  It is not difficult to fly but as a beginner I maybe should have taken a bit more time to orient myself to the controls/features.  The drone took a few knocks on grassy/sandy surfaces but was very durable and sturdy, no damage.  We took the drone out to an open area that was primary concrete and I proceed to crash it into a wall and I mean ""crash""!  My son and I couldn't believe it wasnt in a pile of pieces.<br />The drone was only with minor physical damage but would no longer respond to the controls properly, I called the Holystone and explained to them what happened, they said ""still under warranty send us some pictures of the drone damage and we will get a new one out to you"".  I notified them, sent the pics I received a brand new drone in less than 7 days.  In the meantime I have oriented to the controls and will go to a open grassy place to safely orient myself to flying and not crashing!  I first flew it at the beach so I got to work with the features before the battery ran out, it lasted as advertised for greater than 20min, the carrying case is nice.<br />I like the control hand set, my phone fits in without problems (iphone 11), a bigger phone may have a problem.<br />Nice screen controls, easy to visualize, nice features to bring the drone back to home.  I should have purchased a landing pad right away and I do have one now.  If I decided to upgrade in the future Holystone is where I'm going 1st.  we're waiting for the rain to pass by and then get started on some flying.<br />So a very nice drone, the blades  are in the pictures but for my 1st drone I'm not worried about that and one gets enough of a ""scene"" to crop if necessary.  I like the features for the money that I spent.<br /> The customer service!  I have a feeling that they would have found a way to take care of me even if the warranty had expired, ""a feeling"".<br />All I wanted them to do was repair it,  I would have paid for the repair.

260,1.0,Proceed with caution..,"After a bit of research, I decided to give this unit a try. Out of the box (and charged up) it worked great. After an hour or so of fly time the drone lost its ability to hover in place and would start moving all around (usually starts in circles) when it should have been still. Once this starts, if you do not quickly regain control the unit will go out of control and eventually crash (while you are helplessly watching).<br /><br />So, I returned for a replacement as I did really like it before the issue began. Received the replacement and similar story, out of the box it worked great, but in this case that only lasted around 15 minutes before the same issue began. I worked with customer service (who are very responsive) to try to see if it might be something I am doing or something I am missing but no solution. The replacement drone was returned, and I went with a different brand and am very happy with that purchase.<br /><br />For the price point this is probably the best value out there, but there are clearly some defective units out in circulation. If it were not for the hovering issue, I would have definitely kept. But after 2 units with the same failure, I would not recommend.

The HS720 is an impressive little drone and it is exactly what I was looking for.  The foldable arms and the additional features like the follow me and the auto return home are great features for this drone.  This was easy to connect to my phone and getting it setup to fly was easy too.  The instructions are great and they provide a lot of great information without being overly complex.  I have flown this quite a lot since I have gotten it and I found a few things that would be nice to have for add on accessories like longer landing legs so it is not landing directly on the body,  new vinyl skins or other color body pieces and possibly and upgraded camera.  I would highly recommend this drone to anyone looking for a great quality product that doesn't break the bank.<br />UPDATE - I have been flying this drone for a while now and it is even better than advertised or any of the other reviews.  I have been able to fly it in cold weather and also in winds of about 15 - 20 mph and had no problems at all.  It holds its ground and has absolutely no problems.

The pictures and video at 2K are amazing.  The remote control is  limited to take photos, Low and Hi Speed, Launch and landing, Return to Home feature and the vertical angle of the camera.  To use other advanced features like Follow me, Point of interest, Maps, Tap to fly and many other goodies, you need the phone app.  It uses a 32GB Micro SD to storage video and photos or can storage in the phone.  The GPS feature keeps the drone in an stable fly but wind gusts can move a little.  The battery last over 26 minutes even using the video, photos and landing lights.  It weighs almost 16 onz. so you have to register with the FAA (just $5.00 for recreational purposes).  Good for the price.  The remote control should has other features, like Follow me, integrated.

I mean the drone won’t fall out the sky because your controller died or you press a wrong button. Holy Stone kinda hit it on the head with this drone for beginners. I bought an extra battery so I can have double time and it’s well worth it. I can take great Ariel pictures and 4K video to the sad card 2k feed to your phone.

306,2.0,Far more trouble than expected,"My expectations were not particularly high, this was purchased as a personal toy to have a little fun with photographing my gardens from above.  Mistake.  To begin with, the directions are vague, without much information on which buttons were indicated by names.  It could have used one of those photos with the lines pointing to the parts with labels.  It sort of doubles the frustration of learning something new when you have to resort to trial and error to figure out what the buttons and knobs are supposed to do.  Labels would be so useful.<br /><br />Then getting the software and hardware to sync up was frustrating.  It is far from automatic, with many more parts to the sync up than expected.  One must first get the actual drone to sync with the remote.  That went pretty smoothly.  Then there is the need to sync the wireless settings in your phone to the Holy Stone WiFi.  Not so smooth.  Before the snyc is complete, the drone shuts itself off.  This happens with annoying swiftness and frequency.  Just when you just about have all the syncing done, the drone shuts itself off and the app makes nasty constant beeping.  Then you get to start over again.<br /><br />The app is another cause for exasperation.  As near as I can tell, there is no real documentation for it.  Online videos all show what must be an earlier version of the app that has ""Start"" on it.  The version that actually comes with the QR code does not.  There is a small box labeled ""Enter Device"" which does get you to another screen.  At this point there are more instructions for continuing the snycing process.  It does not work well, with no indication of whether any individual step succeeded or failed.  Again, the drone keeps dying and the process needs to be started over again.<br /><br />After about an hour of this nonsense I got the drone into the air.  It flies well, though far from intuitively.  Some actual instructions about how the thing is supposed to work would be useful.  I discovered that the with the right control stick, pushing up moves the drone in the direction the head was pointed on takeoff.  It does not matter how the drone is rotated the directions remain the same.  It is useful to point the drone toward the north on takeoff and think of the directions as compass directions.  The yaw (turning the drone more or less in place) and the altitude control of the left controller is much more intuituve: up is up, down is down, right turns the drone clockwise, left turns it counter-clockwise.<br /><br />The camera works pretty much as expected except that you do need to go into the settings and select the 4K option each time or low resolution photos are stored in the phone rather than they high resolution photos stored to the card in the drone.  Again, there is a fair amount of confusion as you need to figure out that the onscreen white button takes a photo and the onscreen red button begins a video recording.  I was very interested in this part because the photos were the entire purpose of buying the drone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell what the photos looked like because there is no apparent way to download the photos.  The interface in the app lists only social media apps.  There seems to be no way to download the photos into the gallery on the phone or onto a computer.  The bluetooth option simply does not work.  I can download photos taken by my phone from my phone to my computer via either bluetooth or usb cable, but not from the app that runs the drone.  I don't know where the app hides the photos.  I can access them only through the app--and the app will not allow any of the usual means for download.  My choice is an array of social apps which I do not use.  Another choice would be to attach a photo to a text message.  However, my phone would then condense the attachment to a low res version--and I would have to send it to someone else.  It will not take an email address.  When I attempt to find the files by connecting the phone to my computer, they do not show up on any folder in the Intermal storage.<br /><br />Next time I fly it I will take care to select the 4K option each time I get it going rather than assume that it will store that option at least until I turn off the app.  It may be possible to get the photos off the card by removing it from the drone and putting it in a card reader.  I hope so.  At this point it seems as though I may have bought an expensive piece of junk that is only good if you want to post photos on Facebook.<br /><br />I do realize that this is a sort of low end drone, but I would really expect that even if it was only a $100 drone I should be able to download the photos to use as I want.  The $30 toy camera that I bought my grandson for Christmas does a better job.  I should be able to do absolutely anything I want with my photos.  I should be able to directly access them via the file system or bluetooth and do anything I want with them.  I really can't say that I could recommend it to anyone unless you just want to have fun flying it around like a remote-controlled plane.  But, you can buy those for much less.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEEQJVQQZWHCCUABEZ4RZXWOWUHQ,1644200673233,11,True

I am hoping to get that worked out and take the drone with me to Seattle next month for flights in some of the parks where it is permitted.

352,3.0,"So far so good, but some issues","[[VIDEOID:d788643041dfd3f99abf156592245bad]] For a discount drone, this isn't too bad. It does do 4k video and it does have a decent camera on it. A few of the bad points on this, when I bought it the listing said it has image stabilization. This is incorrect (you can see this from the short video on my review). If you want the EIS you do have to go to the more expensive model. The listing I purchased from has been changed but just a heads up if you see this on here before you purchase. Next, the drone isn't very stable again you can see this in the video where I had it about 30 ft up in a hover, it rocks a lot side to side. This camera seems to over saturate the video a lot. There are camera settings that can be manipulated but first flight out of the box what you see in my photos and video are exactly what you can expect on the 4k setting. Last you'll notice in my photos and videos propellers, again this is straight out of the box and I'm sure you can move the gimbal to remove those from your shot but something to know ahead of time. Overall this is a great 4K drone for someone getting started in the drone hobby who doesn't want to spend too much a drone until they know they like it. It's also good if you're afraid you're going to crash as you won't be out much. Another big plus, the case that it comes with is really nice and not something you see with most drones. Having a case for the drone controller and batterie(s) is really nice. One suggestion, keep the foam that comes on the battery, this is great to have to keep a battery in the drone while traveling but also preventing the drone from starting up in transport.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8162h9A8GYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8162h9A8GYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8162h9A8GYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916qFbMJQ2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916qFbMJQ2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916qFbMJQ2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGPAG6L7JPTVXGEJJ4ACAA3GE4SA,1612455874200,0,True

It was amazing to me that 4 little motors could lift the weight of the drone.

357,5.0,"Great flyer, takes very good video and photos","I upgraded to this model from a less capable one, and that was a great decision. This drone is so much more capable, stable, and easy to fly than most anything else in its price class. In my opinion, it is a real bargain.<br />Pros:<br /> - Folding and unfolding the arms is smooth and precise. With this unit, I don't feel like I may break something.<br /> - First time use is well documented, and the drone lights indicate the working status all along the way.<br /> - GPS satellite acquisition is pretty quick.<br /> - It is very fast and responsive. Yes, racing models and much more expensive ones are faster, but at this class the speed and flight response is excellent.<br /> - It is incredibly easy to fly. While a beginner can enjoy this immediately, I don't believe I will feel throttled back as I become a more proficient ""pilot"".<br /> - The camera output truly is 4K (3840 x 2160) for both video and photos. I guess this is a change from earlier models, but I can verify that resolution.<br /> - The battery life is very good. The flight time is quite good. With other models, I've felt like I just it got up and started to look around when the battery started to run low, but with this drone I've alway felt I had plenty of time to see everything, take plenty of photos, and capture a lot of video.<br /> - I've tested the one-key return and low battery return home, and it usually lands with a foot of the takeoff point.<br /> - The drone feels solid and sturdy. It feels more like  high-end piece of equipment than a inexpensive toy. The build quality is very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Most of the issues I have are with the app, so technically should not apply to the device itself, since the app is not absolutely required. The app settings are a bit tedious, and some of the functions are made more difficult than they should be. There are some features I'd like to see like camera angle display, and the ability to save paths/routes. It would be nice to not see the beginner screen every single time the app starts. The good news is all my complaints could possibly be addressed with app updates.<br /> - The battery charge time is long. It's a pretty big battery, so maybe this one just gets chalked up to physics. The charger must avoid a dangerous overheating or damage to the battery, so perhaps any quicker charging is not possible.<br /> - Yes, there is some jello, but it's hard to imagine how to get around this without adding a couple hundred more to the cost. I balance any camera shortcomings with the fact that this is a sub-$300 drone.<br /><br />Overall, I am thrilled with this drone. I find it pretty amazing that this level of quality, camera resolution, flight characteristics, and capabilities can be had at this price point.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KxqkP-yNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KxqkP-yNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KxqkP-yNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AF54POIL6M3DAMCU77OX6YV7ZE2A,1591571158857,0,True
358,5.0,Great for this beginner even with what I consider to be flaws.,"This was my first drone and as a true beginner, I can say without hesitation that this drone is super easy to take out of the box and get flying. The remote control isn't bad but only got 3 stars because I the controls are backwards from what I am used to as a gamer, I am not sure if any drones are capable of allowing the user to customize what the controls do or not but if so, that would put the controller at 4 stars. The overall build is good, not very heavy and comfortable in the hand but the part that you place your cellphone on POV while in flight is not very good at all. I put my phone in it and about 3 seconds in, my phone fell out. The rounded edges of my iphone causes it to slide around and not sit in the cradle in anyway that is stable so I can not use that function unless I find another solution. The connection to the drone is quick and easy but the latency is about 3 or so seconds so you have to be in a clear open field because line of sight is the only way to fly it. Lastly, as a first time drone user I appreciate the durability of this little drone. I have flown it into two trees and a wall, and my dog managed to jump high enough to snatch it out of the tree and it still works with no issues. The battery life is about right, 20 or so minutes as for the rest of the functions that are used from the software, I am not sure because I can't put my phone in the cradle without it falling out but the big takeaway is that it is durable, fun to fly, and very easy for a beginner to take out the box and fly.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFKIWVMIFZBGCDWCD3NZJKVOB6IA,1574784019250,3,True

360,5.0,Great drone. So much fun to fly,"I’ve had a couple of drones and this one is the most fun to fly so far.  I once had an opportunity to fly a mavic pro and they are awesome but very expensive and out of my price range.  This fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />This is a great little drone.  Folds up to a small size and has a nice case with it.  Very portable.  The remote works really well and the first person video stream is a nice feature.<br />The battery really holds its charge and I get close to 25 minutes before landing every time.  The charge time wasn’t as long as others have reported.  It charged from zero in about 4 hours which is just fine.<br />Pictures are very clear and video looks sharp.  There is a little wavering of the video but that is because the drone is so small that a gust of wind causes it to compensate quickly and the camera shock mount tries to compensate.  I liken it to a person with a slightly unsteady hand.<br /><br />The drone is fast.  So fast that I have a great time making “speeder bike” perspective videos flying above the ground or even through trails in the woods.<br /><br />I turned the saturation down on the camera as the colors were at first a little too saturated.<br />The photos stored in the app are really just for reference.  Choose the photos you want and save them to your phone and they look so much better.  For the best result use a mini sd card onboard the drone.  Those pictures and videos look really good.<br /><br />Pros: easy to fly, fast setup, great remote, small/compact, great still photos, nice video, long flight time on a battery charge, great height and sitance settings. Easy to land.<br />Cons: a little video wobble if windy kind of like a videographer with an unsteady hand (but not constantly), photos look soft in the app (save them to your phone to realize better resolution and save them to a sd card for even better resolution).<br /><br />Would I buy this again? Yes<br />Would I buy this for a child interested in drones? Yes but also check out the hs270 for younger beginners.<br />Would I buy this for an adult? I did, and I am keeping it.<br />Would I use this for professional video and photos?  Maybe, yeah, probably.  There are far more expensive drones and cameras out there if you are looking to go pro with a drone.<br />Does the battery last as advertised?

One touch lift-off gets the drone in the air where it will hover until you push the control stick forward.

I flew to within about 25 feet of where I was standing, pressed the land button and it gently settled down for a perfect landing.<br />The carry case is awesome and is so nice I hated to toss it into my dirty ATV.  It’s very well designed and offers superb protection should you hit a rough spot and bounce your drone off onto the floor.

It gets the job done, but it’s nowhere near as refined as the drone.<br />I think this drone is advertised as being adult level, but I’m not all that experienced, and I found it very easy to fly.

385,5.0,"Will drift on its own, unstable at times when it should just be hovering.","Update after help from HolyStone:<br />1) Before flying, turn the drone on to give it time to setting the GPS coordinate.<br />2) Also before connecting to the drone Wifi and before flying , go to the map view in the app, verify that the GPS circle on the map has settled close to your location, and isn't drifting.<br />3)  Wait for the map to populate the view to your location.<br />4) I've noticed that when the remote antennas are close to the back of my phone, I have control problems. Lower the antennas on the remote away from the back of your mobile phone used for display.<br /><br />After these steps, my flights have been reliable and stable without drifting or control issues.<br /><br />First off, I'm new to drones.<br />Fortunately, this one is quick enough (for me at least) to learn, to recover from its behavior. I've not crashed it myself while trying to control it. It crashes because it drifts into obstacles.<br /><br />There are times where it'll drift laterally; meaning I've commanded it to go forward, but it'll surprisingly drift sideways. Fortunately, I've had some practice sessions and learned to stay on top of it, respond and keep it from crashing itself.<br /><br />In my fairly spacious back yard, I tried the return-to-home feature. Once, it worked well. (The device flies up to a certain altitude, flies laterally to the 'home' location, then lands.)<br /><br />Second try though, it flew up as if it's going to return, then suddenly flew off in an unexpected direction. I reacted and got it back under control, flew it back myself.<br /><br />Though this unit should be easy for new learners, I definitely recommend baby steps. Have it just hover, and learn to catch it when it drifts, then expand the experiments, watching carefully to recover if it 'departs'. One simply can't just let it be on its own; has to be watched and actively controlled.<br /><br />I have been able to use it as intended; such as inspecting my roof, gutters, inspecting a neighbors roof for leaks, etc.<br /><br />The video and still photo quality are usable.

The price is pretty good but compared to the DJI Mini I have to say I’m going to go for the DJI Mini and I’ll give my reason below. Now for HolyStone Customer Service... well.... they’re AMAZING!!! Unfortunately  I have a few issues that I wish I knew moooonths ago. If you’re in an area where there’s interference forget it your drone is going down or out of control and that’s because IN CASE YOUR DRONE STARTS GOING OUT OF CONTROL RELAX!!! RELAX!!! Up the altitude so it doesn’t slam into someone’s house, power lines or trees, pay attention to where the drone is facing and bring it in. If you can’t and all else fails CUT THE GPS!!!!!! Just know that YOU’RE NOW IN COMPLETE CONTROL WHICH IS BETTER THAN THIS DRONE FLYING OUT OF CONTROL BUT KNOW THAT YOU NO LONGER HAVE AN OPTICAL FLOW SENSOR SO BE PREPARED AND PRACTICE FLYING IN THIS MODE ESPECIALLY FOR LITE WIND, BREEZE SITUATIONS. That has happened to me in places where there was no interference before and I saved my drone on numerous occasions because I was ready for it. Now here’s my major gripe!!! The reason for interference being an issue is because the FCC has a rule “that drones can not cause interference but they can not deflect interference either they have to accept/receive the interference, to me that second part gets me mad..... what sense does that make “your drone can not deflect interference?!” THIS IS THE MAJOR ISSUE!!!!! NOW REMEMBER BEFORE HOW I SAID DJI IS AHEAD OF THE PACK, WELL THIS IS BECAUSE DJI HAS ONE OF, IN FACT THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES EVER... The DJI APP has a feature in their app that allows you to search for interference BEFORE EVEN TAKING OFF!! Unfortunately HOLYSTONE DOES NOT have this feature in their app and that sounds like gambling, a $300 gamble and one thing I hate doing is gambling. It just so happened that the one time it failed me was over water, which I’ve flown over on numerous occasions but for some reason on this particular day interference cut it out of the sky and it fell straight into the Long Island Sound, which I actually retrieved after 3 hours of looking on pretty nippy day mIght I add. THE ONE REASON WHY I DO SUPPORT HOLYSTONE IS BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. HolyStone Customer Service asked me for pictures of the drone and they replaced the drone 2 months and 2 weeks after purchase. NOW before you purchase call HOLYSTONE and ask them if they still have the 3 month free insurance if you purchase from Amazon. If NOT I suggest you go and fly in areas you plan to fly in within the first month just in case something happens you can get it replaced.  THE OTHER NEGATIVE.... the controller or transmitter... The drone is capable of going out 500 meters but the remote/transmitter only allowed me 350 yards, MAXIMUM! I figured I’ll buy a stronger remote/transmitter unfortunately the problem with that is, is that the camera on HolyStone Drones has a 5.0ghz signal, the better remote/transmitters run a 5.8ghz signal for cameras, now, you most likely will be able to connect the drone to the remote but not the camera, so where’s the sense in that.  Other than the interference issue, I have had tons of fun flying my drones and would like to thank HolyStone for being the reputable company that it is! Just get the interference check feature and I’ll be more than happy to be the first to purchase that drone! Until then my money is on a DJI MINI for $400 for that simple reason, that interference check is hands down the best feature these drones can have.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGUQW6H5TRJVYONGMB56SSHA4ZKA,1600203202625,6,True

This is my first drone and I had no trouble getting it setup and flying around my property using the remote controller and real time images via WiFi on my iPhone.  I chose the HS720 because of the specified 2K video resolution, and indeed it takes good high-resolution video, but be warned, the video quality is only acceptable with a memory card that you will need to purchase separately, otherwise it is 720p with some obvious motion artifacts.  So be sure to by a memory card and likely a spare battery as well, as recharge time is several hours with the supplied dual battery charger.<br /><br />Since this is my first drone it is hard for me to compare to other drones, except for the superior specified video resolution, but what I can say is that in all my years of online shopping or buying consumer products in general, Holy Stone has the best customer support I have ever experienced.

404,5.0,Quality and affordable!,"I decided to purchase this drone to document an upcoming outdoor school event.  I chose this model based on battery life, automated features, and camera quality.  I am not a professional drone operator by any means, however, I have multiple lesser quality ""toy"" models that I have become proficient at flying.  This drone absolutely blows them away with the quality of construction and features.  It is very easy to control compared to completely manual flight drones.  It has an automatic take off and landing button as well as a return to home function.  It gives me good piece on mind to know that if it goes out of range, or I get disoriented flying, it can come back and land manually using gps.  I did test this feature several times and it worked flawlessly.  Do keep in mind that it does not detect obstacles and can still crash into them on an automatic return flight.  This is unlikely though because the drone will ascend to 100' before returning home and then descend straight down to land.  The camera seems good quality and functions well using a two direction gimble.  A three way would be better but you can still rotate the drone to compensate for this lacking feature.  Picture quality in first person view is very stable.  The follow me mode and point of interest mode work well and will come in handy.  The battery life is superb.  It seemed forever before the low battery alarm sounded!  It amazed me just how compact this drone folds up for storage.  You could fit 2 or three of these in a regular size backpack.  It and all of its components fit in a small zippered carrying case with room for an extra battery, of which, you will definitely want to aquire with how much fun this drone is to fly!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VsxpqmcwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VsxpqmcwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VsxpqmcwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sMYvVcs0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sMYvVcs0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sMYvVcs0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFNG4XAJWN3XLJV5GXDGSU4EPQ5Q,1570818484109,2,True

422,2.0,Issues with major drift during first flight,"Many customers are reporting on the Holy Stone Club Facebook group that their recently purchased HS720 drones are experiencing major drift during take-off, and erratic behavior during the first few flights rendering the drone completely unresponsive and in some cases causing it to crash into things. I wasn't too sure about the reports, but then upon receiving my HS720 and carefully following all of the instructions noticed that upon first take-off the drone suddenly violently drifted and flipped vertically before crashing into a wall. This was very unsettling due to safety concerns. Unfortunately, I do not have the free time to debug the issue or attempt to monitor the data coming back from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, but I would say there is a possibility that many of the recent HS720 cases being reported on the Facebook page by customers are perhaps connected to the same issue. My thoughts are that beyond this being a huge disappointment, it's really a safety concern and that these devices should be carefully inspected by a third party before being sold to consumers. I have considered emailing the FAA to notify them of the reports on Facebook and of course my experience on first flight. My dji Spark never once acted in such a manner, it is always stable and steady during take-off.

Easy, intelligent and reliable","I've had a number of different drones in the past from different manufacturers, but this one is by far the BEST!<br />Each one takes a little thought in getting it going correctly.

WIth pairing.  But remembering what I went through with the HS700, I put my Android NOTE 10 into airplane mode, switched on the WIFI, connected to the HS720E and I was flying in under 8 minutes.<br />Actually, no I wasn't.  The drone flew itself!  That's how easy it is.<br />Great pictures (don't forget the ""class 10"" micro sd card).  Quick to respond, did exactly what I told it to do, came back home within inches of where it took off from.<br />I don't have a vehicle, I have a motorcycle.  With the case, and size of everything I need, it fits in the bag so I can take it with me anywhere I go.  Another PLUS, in my opinion.<br />I have a limited area to fly in, with a small front yard, not much back yard, power lines about 200' away, and a few houses and construction neaerby, but I was able to maneuver between any and all of the obstructions.<br />Sure, I'd recommend this one to anyone who asks.

They concluded that the unit was defective, possibly damaged in transit and sent me a replacement free of charge.

You can tell it is a quality piece when you pick it up. Also, it stays airborne nearly 10 minutes longer than other drones. Functionality puts it nearly on par with DJ Mavic. It is also MUCH quieter than the Mavic. Controls are super easy to learn, as is the app. Return-To-Home function works well and the drone lands within 3ft of the home point every time. In higher winds, things get kind of dicey pretty quick. I do not recommend flying in high winds.

I knew something was wrong when the drone took several times to calibrate it took 8 or 9 times to calibrate.  Then I had to turn off and on the remote and the drone several times to get a wifi signal.  When all this finally work the drone took flight without warning it too straight off to the left at a high altitude then a diagnal path to the ground.  It kinda scared me tell you the truth.  I asked Amazon for a replacement so I'll write another review when I take the new drone out.  UPDATE:.  I've changed my rating to 2 🌟 to 5 🌟 after receiving my replacement drone.  This thing is awesome.  The video is crap and clear the pictures are outstanding.  The flight is as advertised the wind was at 10 mph and it handled it like a champ.  It did a great orbital, and follow. The altitude flight was high than I expacted.  If you want a great foldable drone this is a bargain.  The fight time was on point as advertised 24 minutes and it laded back to gps when it was low.

446,5.0,"Well made, easy to use, good images can be gotten (updated 10/25/2021)","This is a well made drone.  It uses high quality parts, especially at the price point.  It is easy to fly (when you can find a place to legally fly it).  Getting good video or still images is hit or miss.  I have tried very hard to get good video, followed all the tips and done my best but my videos are still shaky in places and I have yet to get a well-focused still image.  I send my concern to the vendor but have yet to hear back from them.  I am sure they are dealing with manpower shortages like the rest of the world.  I will keep trying and if I am able to manage to get some improvements I will revisit this review and share what I learn.  It does have one other minor issue in that the return to home almost works but it never seems to get back to where it started in most cases.  It is usually about 6-10 feet away.  This is not a problem for me, but could be for someone operating off a boat...<br /><br />So there are some things I have figured out over time.  The first this is that Holy Stone's customer service will make every effort to make sure any problem is resolved and I want to give them very high marks for this.  With regard to the area's I had difficulty with - here are some clarifications:<br /><br />The drone relies upon GPS signals to return to it's home.  You can get it to fly without a good GPS signal and you can even control it fairly well - but getting a reliable GPS signal makes this a much more usable platform.  Since I was using this in a large building, the GPS signals were not that good.  We opened up a roof panel (this is a large metal building) and once we got a usable signal good things started to happen.  I figured out why it was so touchy to fly - it really wants a decent GPS signal.<br /><br />One thing I will share is that if very stable high definition imagery is you goal, just spring for the 720E right up front.  While the 720 has good imagery, the electronically stabilized circuitry in the 720E takes this to an entirely new level.  This is especially important for any post flight editing you want to do but it also works with the Ophelia Go app as well.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFEQSB7253WOPVSTU7T25EGWSI2Q,1633523640888,2,True

449,5.0,Even adults need some toys to play with,"That's by no means to say this drone is a toy; the Holy Stone HS720 is an awesome aerial work of art.  I'm a novice to the drone world, so getting a drone with good stability and a GPS return to home feature were critical requirements for making my drone short list.  I also wanted a drone touting good camera resolution with the ability to remotely adjust the camera angle during flight.  Using this criteria brought my ""drone to buy"" list down to about three options.  I didn't want to spend too much on my first drone, and $300 was going to be a stretch at the time.  But when the ""lightning deal"" was offered by Amazon along with the 5% off coupon, I couldn't resist giving the nod to Holy Stone--and I'm certainly glad I did.  The HS720 offers a slick style that feels solidly constructed.  I love having the custom case (included) to keep everything protected and organized.  Since I'm still getting the hang of flying a drone, I haven't pushed it to its limits yet or experimented with all of the flight features out of fear that I will accidentally crash my new investment.  But this drone is very responsive to the transmitter, making it easy to maneuver through airspace.  The 4K camera takes great photos and videos, though I recommend using a TF card since it will get you much better video quality.  The return to home features work as promised, usually landing the drone within three feet of the launch point.  My only qualm so far is the 5-7 hour charge time between flights.  However, since most drones under $300 have to provide two batteries to achieve the 26 minute flight time this one can handle with one, I can let that slide.  The Holy Stone HS720 (4K) is an excellent choice for any drone novice, but still packed with all the advanced features that even the best drone pilots would be looking for.  In retrospect, $300 is a very good price for this drone, making the $240 I paid a steal of a deal!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AETZLFIPQJAKTJ5ACRNQFHBYXOJA,1596685206052,0,True

If you are looking for a drone with high end features but under 500$ stop looking and buy this one.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yjh7hHYfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yjh7hHYfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yjh7hHYfL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SryIQD3tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SryIQD3tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SryIQD3tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGIHQYNG5CWWXSUBECVJ4AVHS5NA,1658418303340,2,True

They do not honor their 90 day warranty and after getting a hold of an actual person at Amazon I'm finally getting to return it.  Camera went bad at 84 days.  If you buy, get an extended warranty most definitely so you won't have to deal with the Holy Idiots.<br /><br />Update (late as it was returned a few months ago):<br />I do not recommend this drone.  After having some success with it... the calibration always acted like it wasn't needed...that's simply false b/c the drone flies with a mind of its own and at a destructive path at that.  The last draw was trying to calibrate it and it took off and nailed the side of the house.  Fortunately, I bought insurance this time, sent it back and got my money for the drone.  I'm waiting on checking into something better but I'm not going $1000s for DJI... I heard their horrible to deal with too even with the insurance.

I updated the app.  Followed all the trouble shooting steps then finally contacted the manufacturer with a detailed e-mail about the problem and the steps I had taken as well as both my phone met the criteria for use with the drone. The response was confusing, I was asked about things that I had clearly stated in the e-mail and was told to try the things I had already told them I had done. Then after a second e-mail from mere-stating that I had obviously done what they were telling me to do and sent snapshots of the proof of me doing it.  They gave me the name of another older app to try.  It worked, Finally.  I am not certain if the older app has the same options and qualities as the app that was supposed to operate the drone but.....  It works, it flies, it takes picture and video's....

Haven't tried the follow me mode, orbit mode, or programmed route just yet. Looking forward to trying that next!<br /><br />Update: bought another one for a family member as a gift, again really great product, just a side note, make sure you have the GPS calibration completed before you take off, if you have a solid red lights and a solid yellow light instead of green the GPS signal isn't locked/calibrated! A quick fix is to fly the drone straight into the air a little bit and it'll get a gps signal, do not attempt to do a return to home when the light is still yellow and not green or else your drone will just land at it's current position just an fyi! Other than that great for beginners, wifi signal is ok, I'd say about 50m is optimal before you start losing a signal with your cell phone/tablet.<br /><br />Great product Holy Stone!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHHOIZCKYODWFGHEWRWSNNXULSQQ,1568438834427,12,True

478,2.0,Dropping my rating to 2 stars after 3 months.,"Very good first impressions after 4 flights.  Solidly high quality build. First time drone pilot.  Flew it easily using the ""quick start guide"" the first try in tight surroundings (house and trees).  Flew over snow which may have confused  auto hover,  drifted around a little but easily controlled.  Responsive but not touchy. Quick start guide does lacks some important details, highly recommend reading the user guide prior to flight.  Else the sequence of lights. pairing, and beeps on start up my not be understood, and drone may not be properly calibrated with  GPS and phone. This is important - I pressed home with drone hovering 10ft over landing pad on my deck and drone immediately zoomed 10ft ahead and slammed into my house - likely because of inadequate gps satellites at launch.  No damage at all from crash -  Solidly high quality build.  Pro: Quick, agile, easy to fly, good battery, high tech features, rugged.  Con: Battery charger has two spots but only charges one at a time.  Instructions for drone and required app (Ophelia GPS) are confusing and incomplete.  A concise pre-flight check list of initialization, calibration, pairing in sequence would be much appreciated.  Latter is the reason or 4 (not 5) star rating.  Camera performance to be determined.  So far very happy with this drone. Customer service excellent to this point, although website can be glitchy using Spectrum cable and Firefox.  I may receive a battery from HS for submitting a review, but either way this is my unbiased opinion.<br />Update March 11, 2020:  Very limited range (150 m) for live video feed to your phone.  HS confirmed that is their normal range.  By comparison I watched an inexpensive ($199) Potensic drone yesterday that maintained live video feed at 550m.  Without the live video feed to navigate and compose photos,  the effective range of this drone is very disappointing.  Video quality is jittery when drone is moving or in light wind.  Camera gimbal has significant lag time and is too touchy for effective panning.  I rate the video capability as 1 star, photo capability 3 stars, flight capability 5 stars.  The HS 720 would be a solid  5 star intermediate drone if the video feed distance matched/beat  the Potensic drone  and camera gimbal issues were resolved.  Fun to fly but frustrating as a video drone.  Customer service was excellent, fast, and courteous .",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGOHDONNLQDQFR2IRSK3IFD4ST3A,1577577190523,5,True

487,5.0,My brother loves it,"I bought this as a gift for my brother so we can go on some photography adventures. His words are below, and then I'll add a couple of things I noticed at the end.<br /><br />My brother's review:<br /><br />Overall this is a good drone. My situation is probably different from most. From the get go I had issues with the drone connecting to the gps satellites. I contacted the support and they were very helpful on determining the issue. After exhausting all possible leads of the problem they determined the drone was defective and  informed me I would receive a replacement drone within 3 to 6 business days and no need to return the drone and to keep it for spare parts. On the 6th day I hadn't received the drone nor a tracking number as I was told. Holy stone asked me to contact Amazon to check the status. After checking with amazon they informed me they had not received an order from holystone. At that point i reached out to holystone and informed them on the situation.  At that point they informed me they would send another expedited. I did finally receive the drone after 10 days or so. That was the real issue I had.  The replacement drone works very well and they let me keep the defected drone for spare parts. I wouldn't think most people would experience this. I've had other holystone drones that have had no issues. The drone is good quality and very durable. It's easy to fly and when connected to gps it's very steady. For the cost that it is you definitely get your money's worth. This is a great drone for someone starting into the photography side of drones. It takes great photos and is equipped with a 2k camera.  I've had no issues with the app and all the functions equipped with it. Holystone stands by their products and I learned this from experience. I would recommend this to family and friends that are beginners and beyond looking into the hobby of drones.<br />----<br />My thoughs:<br /><br />1. The props will show up in photos when the gimbal is looking forward. I think that's important to consider.<br />2. I do love how the remote has an extended phone spot at the top, so you're not forced to remove your phone case to make it fit.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHYIYRSORUDHTMGCS4EXTX2FKUZA,1588879679767,0,True
488,5.0,Excellent Features and Quality Mid-Level Drone,"After researching drones (quad-copters for the purists) from fun toy-grade styles to high end models I decided to go for the Holy Stone HS720.<br /><br />Why?<br />It is compact, foldable and feature rich, especially for the price point<br />I have been flying toy-grade for years and exploring if I will appreciative a higher grade model<br />High ratings<br /><br />Pros<br />1/3 the cost of a DJI Mavic<br />Features of models costing 2 - 4 times as much<br />Quality product - very well made<br />Remote is good for larger hands (wish it would hold a mini tablet)<br />App, tech, all features worked as advertised (live video, follow me, orbit, pathing with 2 methods, point 2 point or freehand draw a path)<br />Return to home has been flawless, lose signal? battery low? No problem, it lands within inches of takeoff<br />Nearly 30 mins run time, it seems to run forever<br />Safe - all safety features work well<br /><br />Cons<br />Wish it had more range ( you will lose connection long before you lose sight of it)<br />5 - 7 hour battery charge time vs. 1.5 - 2 hours for DJI Mavic (I bought extra batteries to make up for this)<br />Not as stable in-flight filming as $1,000 models<br /><br />Overall, this is a high quality, fun, easy to fly drone with all the features you would want - for around $300 you can't beat this. On top of that, the company is responsive, friendly and helpful. Una is the best! When was the last time you emailed a manufacturer/seller on Amazon and received continual, prompt, helpful responses?

The camera is really good, the picture I included is from about 300ft and even shows the curvature of the Earth.

491,1.0,Must Be a Scam?,I see drone videos that are smooth and not jerky at all. Well they certainly were not taken with a HS720. The videos are terrible and not usable for vlogging. I could have bought a drone for $50 that performs better so why the high price? Is this a scam? When I take it up about 100 feet to video my property I have trouble making it go forward. I tried to video my house at about 50 feet and suddenly it just went its own way and flew into a tree and crashed. Now when I push the up button that raises it to 4' it idles there for a couple seconds then the left rear motor goes full speed and if flips over and flies into the ground without me touching the controller at all. To make matters worse the company does not answer emails.,[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGAZQZ3AHV3SE6SPQDAFUFHA2VPA,1608035152411,6,True

493,5.0,A great drone to own,"This is a great Drone to own, takes good Quality photos, that will amaze you and your Friends. You can move the camera up and down while in flight. I found it best in the beginning to start off slow as a beginner, to get familiar with the drones controls and multiple range settings to keep you flying the drone in a comfortable area range to start with . I also found it best to turn off your WiFi on your smartphone to prevent interference with the your drone signal while flying. Another thing I did to help in keeping up with the direction of the drone flying in bright conditions, was adding white and red reflective tape to the front and rear of the drone. I give the HS720 5 stars, for its control flying ability, flight time, and a great price.<br />Kevin","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJrqDF5zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJrqDF5zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FJrqDF5zL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HzZTWREuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HzZTWREuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HzZTWREuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4ZwXfQPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4ZwXfQPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4ZwXfQPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pc7pByhbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pc7pByhbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pc7pByhbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEKRZGZ372FY4ISYIDAEV5LECKMQ,1571169806421,0,True
494,5.0,Well made and worth it.,"I'm fairly new to flying drones other than the little ones you can fly in the home. This drone was a lot of fun just taking it out and learning how to use it. It isn't hard to set it up and get the basics down. With a little bit of practice I believe anyone can be pretty good at flying it. The battery life for my flight was about 20 minutes and that was with it on fast flying mode, recording most of the time, and seeing how far it would go. It goes far enough away to where you can't see it anymore. I believe it can go farther but I didn't want to push my luck. It was a pretty winding day where I live and the drone did a pretty good job holding it's own. It would drift if a good gust of wind came through. It looks well made. The arms fold in and out nicely. The case is great too the drone and controller fit in it snugly and don't move around. All in all I'm am very happy with my purchase. The only downside is that the battery takes 5 to 7 hours to charge but I believe almost every drone is that way so nothing against this drone itself that's just the technology we have at this point. I will definitely be getting some more batteries so I can play with it longer.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGPJ6WL5RPOCYTS2SV6GDJFGDK5Q,1570129439507,1,True

498,5.0,First impressions of HS720 Drone,"I have had the HS 720 for 3 weeks now and I am truly impressed with both it and HS tech support. I don't claim to be experienced in Drones but I have been flying RC airplanes for many years. So, with that said let me make a few observations about this HS 720 drone.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />  It comes with instruction pamphlets that are written in plain English unlike my other drone's instructions which were obviously written by a 6 year old Chinese lad. Trying to decipher its meaning was/is nearly impossible. These instructions are clear and you can follow them with no trouble.<br />  The drone comes well packed and has a nice carrying case. Wish it was a little bigger to carry things like a spare battery.<br />  The drone is much heavier than my other one and that makes it possible to fly it in stronger winds. I would say that anything up to 10mph winds is doable. Anything over 6mph needs to be done in HI speed.<br />  Controls are good but I wish it had a ""slower reaction"" setting. When doing a video, the slightest touch of either the left or right controls causes the drone to ""pitch"". You see that in the video as a jerk. Course it may be me not being easy enough on the levers.<br />  It has a slot for a 32gig max memory card. This is a lifesaver. When a card is present, and you have selected video record, the video goes straight to the card. Not saved on the phone by the app. The other drone I have has a tendency for the App to die and since the video that was being shot is stored on the phone and app, the video is lost. This single factor of having a card slot for saving video/photo's is worth its weight in gold.<br />  The HS app that is used is ""Ophelia GPS"" and it seems to be rock solid. It has yet to fail and for some reason, it simply feels good to use. Maybe its because my other drone's app failed 3 out of 5 flights. This one has performed flawlessly. The video you see on the phone has a very short lag from what the drone sees and what is displayed on the phone. It's only about a second and thats not bad. I think it increases a tiny bit as the drone is farther away but I'm assuming it's simply transmission time from drone to phone. Thats to be expected.<br />  Getting the 720 up and recording is a breeze. I have tried several of its functions and they have all worked. Return to Home is excellent. I've landed within 2 or 3 feet from where it took off from. Just be aware that it does not have collision avoidance technology so if you need to take care when using RTH. The Point of Interest is fascinating to watch and gives a nice video record of where your flying and the surrounding area. That setting can be increased to give you a wider circle while you are flying. The ""Follow Me"" function is good but there are hazards to using it. It uses you GPS from your phone to follow you. It does not follow you like its on rails. Example. You start out a position A. Drone is behind you. You go straight ahead 100 feet to point B. Drone is behind you. You make a 90degree turn left and go straight to point C.  The drone will NOT proceed directly to point B and make a left turn just like you did to follow you. It will see that you have made a turn and it will cut the corner to catch up with you at point C. So be aware of that quirk and you won't end up with your drone in a tree or worse after you have made a turn. It's a fun feature but it has its drawbacks.<br />  Cons.<br />  It only comes with 1 battery and its supposed to give up to 28 minutes of flight time. The re-charge time for the battery is 5 to 7 hours and it does take that long. A 11 minute flight took 2:45 minutes to re-charge. Now when I got my 720, and flew it for the first time, I did about a 7 minute flight. I put the battery on charge and 8 hours later it still indicated that it was not charged fully. I UN-plugged the charger hub and waited 20 minutes and reconnected the battery and it showed fully charged. NOT GOOD. At what point during that 8 hours did the battery become fully charged? I did several short flights to verify that there was a problem and they all failed . I did not want to overcharge the LiPo but I couldn't tell when it was fully charged. I contacted Holy Stone Support and it took some doing but they did send me a new Charging Hub with cables and it fixed the problem. The Support Team is excellent and easy to contact and they will work with you if you have a problem.<br />  You need to have at least 2 batteries for a good day of shooting videos. These batteries are EXPENSIVE  but worse than that, they are not available right now. I hope they get these in stock soon.<br />  I have no other complaints and I really like the HS720. I think that anyone who buys one will be happy with the drone and know that Customer Service is TOPS.

501,5.0,Best drones for skilled users and beginners...,"[[VIDEOID:523781c2de05a879c065a0bb45f0a253]] I have owned several Holy Stone drones and  love all of them.I have been a Holy Stone customer now for almost 6 years. I have several Holy Stone drones, everything from the micro drone to the mid-range with a 4K camera system. I love the reliability of the products and I know that when I have the time to spend outside I can fly without any headaches. Don't get me wrong, I have had some issues with a few of the units, but every single time I have either called or emailed Customer Service, they have gone over and beyond what was expected and the issue was resolved in a matter of just a few days. One thing with these drones you can't lose them. I have heard stories of drones flying away on there own and such but with most of Holy Stone drones that isn't possible. They have what is called a return to home button on them that if the battery fails or is going bad then the drone knows and will fly back to you and land in the same spot that it took off from. Also, if the connection between the drone and controller breaks then the drone also knows and flies back to you. And if you happen to lose site of HS drones during flight you can just push the RTH (return to home) button and the drone automaticly comes back to you. I also always thought that a drone would be hard to learn to fly but not with these. The instruction manual tells you exactly what and how to get it started and keep it in the air.  These drones have a thing called hovering which means they will hover in place anywhere you want them to. They hook up to satilites b4 flight so they know where they are all the time and know where they took off from. If you let go of the controller while drone is in flight then it will stop where it is until you start guiding again. If they don't have GPS then most of their drones have altitude hold that causes them to hover.  I always thought I had to keep trying to manage the flight of the drone and keep it moving or it would fall from the sky but that isn't true. With the automatic hovering, they will stay in place till you get control of yourself and the drone. I have one of their small ones that I fly in the house when it is raining or too windy to fly outside. My dog loves it. Like I said, I am no professional with flying these and never will be and have crashed into the house, on the road, and got them stuck in trees and most if any damage done to the drone is maybe a scared or broke prop. When this happens then I replace prop or props with the new ones that come in the box with the drone when I purchased it. All the ones I have bought have always had the extra props, the manual, a small screw driver, and charging cords in the box. I have owned and still own some of the drones such as the HS110, HS100, HS112, HS700, HS700D, HS720, HS165, and some smaller toy drones.  All from Holy Stone so I know what I am talking about when I say the these drones are the best ones to buy for beginners or anyone that just likes to get out and fly.  Am planning on buying the new HS600 sometime this summer to see what it is all about.  So in summing up this review, you can't go wrong with the Holy Stone drones weather it be the house drone or the more expensive ones.  They are all reliable and if not then Customer Service will fix what problems you might have with them....Thanks for reading...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51H84DMSwkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51H84DMSwkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51H84DMSwkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HYBlx2igL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HYBlx2igL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HYBlx2igL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UnuTVe-BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UnuTVe-BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UnuTVe-BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gKytC1bmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gKytC1bmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gKytC1bmL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r6U0G87FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r6U0G87FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r6U0G87FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ue-SmqMPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ue-SmqMPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ue-SmqMPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEY75EZUYQETEZLHMD7IH3AZKX5A,1645685973942,0,False

509,5.0,Superb machine for beginners as well aqs experienced flyers.,"I was fast approaching the end of my 70s and after watching the youngsters flying domes on the beach where I live I decided it was time to go for it myself. I love photography and could not wait to experience it from a totally new perspective. I have to admit that it was more than a bit intimidating, having never even been near one before, but a bit of research fortunately led me to the Holy Stone HS720, and after reading the manual and watching one video on YouTube I was set to give it a go. It definitely is the drone for beginners, but it did absolutely everything the manual and controls indicted it would and having two speeds to play with on the open beach was neat as well. It did not take long into this first flight for me satisfy myself that I could do it with some confidence and not be concerned about losing it with the built-in return to home as the battery weakens. Even in a bit of wind it easily landed within inches of where it took off from when I pressed the Return to Home button. I snapped my first several photos (my first one is shown here) and was more than satisfied with the results. The two toggles worked great to have the drone smoothly go up, down, forward, backward and to the sides, as well as rotate in place. It is hard to believe what a powerful new experience this was. I said it was for beginners, but I cannot imagine even experienced fliers not enjoying this beautiful machine.  Everything I needed to begin a new dimension of photography for me, just as I had hoped.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jvUmsKfaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jvUmsKfaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jvUmsKfaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AF3Z5FXZRSIJFIKIIKQXR4ZDRANA,1578333830111,0,True

520,4.0,Great entry level drone with an awesome return to home feature!,This is a great drone for beginners or intermediate users. The thing I like the most about it is the return to home feature. This drone has the ability to return to the spot where you started from if you lose track of it you just press the return home button on the remote and it will come back to you.<br />The great feature is that it uses GPS to help stabilize the drone so it will stay in place in the air where you want it without having to continually compensate for wind. Just make sure you takeoff in an area where there is no over head Obstructions because the drone will come back to that place in Lan Wright where you took off. Also with the battery gets too low it will return to your start position.  It takes great video and photos too.  I use it with my iPhone 10 and a downloadable app.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z9Yrba+BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z9Yrba+BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z9Yrba+BL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815wmXf9ZwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815wmXf9ZwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815wmXf9ZwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHMRNEO33ZVGRBOYSVRXISHWJRKQ,1602701634728,0,True

527,5.0,battery issue ****Updated****,"I wanted to update this review and let everyone know that Holystone's customer service is wonderful! I ended up giving this drone another chance with their help and they got me flying right. I've got to admit with the replacement drone this has really changed my opinion of this drone. The issues I experienced before are no longer present. Appears to have been a defect on the last one as the replacement drone is working much better. Part of my issues was related to building interference, which would cause a drifting effect and ultimately messes with the distance you can fly. So make sure you're not near buildings when flying this. Otherwise in an open field or park setting, flight is stable, camera is real good and I get the full 26 min of flight time, which I appreciate the accurate truth when purchasing a product. Other drones will say they give you 30, but that's usually rounded up for marketing. This thing is fast, watch out for that mode, but you can switch this on or off.  Holystone has been very responsive to my questions and addressed all my concerns. If you're looking for an affordable drone that offers the same advanced features that you get from more expensive drones, I would seriously recommend the Hs720. You can feel rest assured that if you have any issues you will have a stellar support team who's got your back. Any issues you may experience can usually be sorted out by talking with their team. (Cathy is especially awesome, but the rest of the team has been great too) I'm happy with my purchase. I'm a fan and will recommend this product to anyone who is a drone hobbyist starting out. I'd also recommend getting a second battery so you can enjoy it longer. Thank you Holystone for your help and turning this experience around for me.<br />___________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Let me start by saying this is a nice looking drone, smaller than what I thought, but a real nice looking drone. I received the drone and thought I would put a charge on it as I assume it was shipped half charged? But I may've had a defective battery, because when I charged it, the charger had a fast blinking light which indicates its charging.. the next morning I looked and it was still blinking. I put the battery in the drone, it showed as full. So i took it out for my first flight and noticed some odd issues right away. First when I flew straight out about 100m I lost connection with the drone, it returned back. I thought that was odd, so I took it out there again at around 90-100m I was no longer able to turn the drone left or right.. I could still move forward and back.. when I brought it back to about 50m I was able to regain full control and could move about normally. This drone is rated to work up 1600m (800m with video recording) the video got choppy at 75-80m and then cut out. This odd flight issue could be with android 10, it sounds like a lot of drone owners are having issues with Note 10+ android 10, probably something to do with the GPS not locking correctly. But the biggest disappointment here was the battery life, I only got 17 minutes of flight time after charging overnight before it started beeping and it returned home. I think the charge time of these batteries is ridiculous at 5-7 hours to recharge and to only get 17 min..  no thanks, it could've been a defective battery possibly, but with that and the other app/ phone (androind 10) / connection issues I don't think this one is for me. I'll be sending this back.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AETSFVD3S2UHFR4ZYZNEIVTJEKGA,1579134908497,1,True
528,5.0,"Just as good as the DJI Phantom 3 but 4x smaller, quieter, and cheaper","I bought this thing to replace my DJI Phantom 3 which has an unrecoverable software issue. I wasn't expecting it to be this good but it really does everything the DJI does. It's also lighter, easier to carry, quieter in flight, less complicated to operate, and costs 4 times less. The battery time seems about comparable at around 20 minutes. The drone itself acts as a wireless access point with the cell phone and control acting as network devices. You record both on the drone and the cell phone. My main purpose is to create panoramas using images stitched together. It's in 4K same as the DJI so my photos are indistinguishable.

About 10 - 15 feet in the air and over a few yards. I wanted to test to see if it would come back to the landing pad. Hit the RTH button, it shoots up into the air and looks like it is on the way back. All of a sudden, it just takes off into into a different direction at high speed and finally gets trapped into a tree. I tried to disable the RTH mode but it didn't respond.

I was able to get drone close enough to my location and it crashed into a neighbor's tire, no damage. I was so shaken, I thought that someone hijacked the drone. I put the drone away and did nothing. For months. My fault.<br /><br />Fourth flight was in a remote area, on a hilltop.<br /><br />I decided to fly drone again, since there would no chance of interference or hijacking. As soon as drone took off, it was unresponsive and began to circle around me. As before, return to home function did not work. Drone circled around me a few times, I was able to drop the drone's altitude enough to where it crashed into a tree, about 150-180 feet from me. Was fortunate that it crashed, otherwise it would have been almost impossible to find. My son saw where it crashed and we recovered it.<br /><br />There was no visible damage. I found that the tab that holds the battery was sheared off so battery will not lock into drone.<br /><br /> To be honest, I am scared to even try to fly it again.<br /><br />I am out of Amazon's 30 day return period.<br /><br />If anyone has input on ways to fix the drone, I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise, It's a $265 lesson learned.<br /><br />I don't recommend the Holystone HS720 drone, it's better to with something else.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFSADTDTLI4FOGGYIVX6DLJO7QHQ,1679398687444,0,True
555,5.0,Crazy good value.,"I should start off by saying the obvious: You can definitely find this drone cheaper elsewhere online, but I chose Amazon for two main reasons: quick delivery and the fact that if I needed to return a defective unit (which is always a risk with clone products like this) I knew that process would be painless. So I paid a bit extra for peace of mind, but I stand by that decision.<br /><br />Even with the extra money spent, I've gotta say, this little thing is an amazing value. It's battery life is amazing and while a 5 hour charge might seem a bit much, given the ridiculously long flight times - by modern drone standards, anyway - It's more than fair. The included charger allows you to charge up to two batteries simultaneously (note that the kit only comes with one). Also included in the kit are clearly marked A & B rotor assemblies for when you do eventually break them, which (surprisingly) I have not managed yet. And not for lack of trying either!<br /><br />While I certainly don't advocate that anyone be as reckless as I am, I do all the stuff with drones they tell you not to do. Fly over water, in (moderately) windy conditions, through the woods. Just today I flew it down a river with overhanging branches. Thankfully I didn't crash it (specifically there), but I've already tree'd the thing three times and it's held up like a champ each time. The only 'damage' I've incurred was needing to manually move the camera gimble so it could be remotely operated again. Your mileage may vary, of course, but it's much sturdier than it really has any right to be. I can't even imagine what the flight time would be like if they used lighter/flimsier materials.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />1) Get a good (class 10) microSD card. The recording functionality in the app is 'fine' for proof of concept or simple land surveying, but the video feed from the drone to the app is so bit-crushed for low latency that you will be MUCH happier with the footage off the SD card.<br />2) The video feed from the app is NOT low latency enough to FPV flight. In addition to the field of view being a bit to narrow, there feels like a solid half second or more of delay between input and response. It's fine for slow movement in a big open area at altitude, but if you're around trees and at anything resembling speed, you may as well be the titanic heading for an iceburg. By the time you're trying to dodge the tree, you're already in it.<br />3) This little guy is QUIET by most drone standards. And it's also basically the color of shadows on the forest floor. So if you ever think you might risk loosing it, I'd recommend picking up some Day Glow Orange paint (the same high visibility orange hunters have on their vests) and putting a wide pen stripe around the body of the drone. I mention the sound because typically when you crash this thing, the rotors stop, but even if they're going, they might not be audible enough for you to actually find it on sound alone.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEBL4E2OZLNGNEJ7PBXWUYH37OKA,1592758395502,1,True

After charging the batteries every time I flew the drone 20’ away from myself with the controller it lost all control.

It did this 3x in a row after I went back through all steps to make sure I hadn’t missed anything and repeatedly did the same thing. The final time it hit a tree and broke a propeller arm. I was really hoping I could make an entry to drones without going with something more expensive but that was clearly a mistake.

580,4.0,"Excellent Drone, flight is smooth, great GPS features, but beware, NO HEADLESS MODE!","For Christmas, my wife bought me an HS110D drone. I have never flown a drone before, so she thought this would be great to start out with. At times, pairing and syncing the drone with the controller was not very easy. Often times, the drone would take off on its own and it would not respond to controller commands, ultimately ending up with a crash. This might be because of the lack of GPS. However, because I really enjoyed flying it when it worked well, especially in Headless Mode as a beginner, I took a GIANT leap and purchased the HS720. This unit does have GPS. After reading MANY reviews, this drone fit the bill for me. I took my first flight with it yesterday and I must say, it is very smooth and not too loud in my opinion....keeping in mind I am not a professional drone operator. The GPS modes are AWESOME. I especially like the Return To Home mode. It worked great. I have not tried the Follow Me mode or the Orbit mode yet, but I am sure they will be great as well. There is however, one issue that I have with the HS720. Some of the reviews I read about the HS720 said the drone defaults into HEADLESS MODE which means you can control the flight path of the drone with normal controller commands, no matter what direction the drone is facing. This is INCORRECT. I attempted to rotate the drone and fly it away from me, but it flew towards me, and moved the joystick left but the drone went to the right. This tells me it is NOT in headless mode. There is no way to turn headless mode on/off on the controller like the HS110D had. I called Holy Stone to verify this, and sure enough, I was told the HS720 DOES NOT have headless mode. I guess I will just have to learn to fly it traditionally. THIS IS NOT A DEAL BREAKER FOR ME! I really do like most of the other features of this drone. Another thing that could make this drone even better is to mount the camera on an actual gimbal for image stability, instead of a simple shock mount. Charging the battery does take a long time, so try to get a spare battery in order to enjoy flying for longer periods of time. Also there are no obstacle sensors on the front, sides, or rear of the drone which would help avoid crashes. Finally, there are no removable crash bumpers around the rotor blades.<br />At the end of the day, you are not buying a $1000-$1500 drone with all of these above listed features, but you are getting a GPS capable, collapsible drone that will fly smoothly, has great GPS features, hovers in one place like a champ due to the sensor on the bottom, looks really cool, comes in its own carrying case, and best of all.......costs less than $300.

583,4.0,Great Entry-Level Drone!,"This was a bit of an impulse buy after reading other reviews. I would definitely say it delivers!<br />With the exception of ""throw-away"" indoor models, I'm a novice to drone flying and wanted something with basic features (decent camera, ""follow me"", GPS, auto-return, etc.) that didn't break the bank. This has been a fun introduction to the hobby and it is very easy to fly. I've only flown it a few days and am still learning but some initial thoughts/highlights are:<br /><br />1. Packaging: 5/5, the carrying case is high-quality and everything stores away safely and snugly.<br /><br />2. Durability: 4/5, feels to be a well-made and durable product. I crashed it only once in mulch (from about 6 feet) and it survived. There are replacement blades if needed. Some cages would be nice (to protect people as much as the blades) but then it wouldn't be as portable/foldable.<br /><br />3. Control/Pairing: 3/5, I had no issues pairing to my iPhone 8 via onboard wifi or getting the drone and controller paired and oriented. The instructions weren't extensive, but made the process clear. The indicator lights are hard to see in daylight so I ignored that part (I just waited a few seconds longer than I thought I should to allow whatever lights to change) and it worked anyway. My biggest problem with the controller is how small everything is and how close together things are. When trying to get the phone clipped in and push whatever buttons I need, I continuously bump some other button/setting (hence the aforementioned crash). Some of this is me being a beginner, but I'd really like a little bit bigger control and a slightly less ""busy"" phone screen interface.<br /><br />4. Flight: 5/5. It feels ""zippy"" and responsive to this novice. It is small, so mild breezes do affect it significantly and might limit use. Even so, I had no problems at all getting it do to what I want and am only just starting to push it further/faster. Follow-me and return modes worked well enough. It hovers and lands within a foot or so of its take-off point every time.<br /><br />5. Camera: No score. It works. I got nice enough photos from it and could view them on the phone and in the app without problems. There is a bit of lag where the video is concerned in that you need to hover a bit for the picture to come in and stabilize but this is an entry-level drone and I had no expectations that it would perform like $1-10k products. The pan up/down adjuster on the control is a little tricky to dial in to get the view you want.<br /><br />In summary: it has provided a great introduction to the hobby and provides surprising quality and functionality at this price point.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEPYC7YQZECAZCLJS2K5NEDEJNTA,1588367235493,0,True

589,5.0,Great Beginner Drone,"So glad I did my research on this drone. The features are really well thought out. The RTH (Return To Home) is one of the best features too! I found the HS720 to meet my expectations for a drone under the $300 range. So far I have over 20 flights and have yet to be disappointed. You will wan to purchase a 32GB  memory card, micro-SD (max size for the drone). I'm using an iPhone 6c to control mine and it works fine. If you are looking for an entry level drone, I highly recommend you consider the HS720.<br /><br />Update 4/7/20<br />After an issue with my HS720 I contacted Holy Stone customer service and spoke with Daryl. I explained my situation in detail and he determined that a replacement was the only way to resolve my problem. The customer service this company provides is awesome and a rare thing these days! Great job Daryl and Holy Stone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U9wUw0fGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U9wUw0fGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U9wUw0fGL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81elMeqJkkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81elMeqJkkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81elMeqJkkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGBGFKJGT5TTVKERXN4Y4VMYUSVQ,1584625002622,0,True

It is a sturdy little drone; props are the most frequent consequences of crashes. I chose this company because they had a reputation for great customer service, and because I like to root for an underdog, (in terms of market share). It often makes them try harder. They did not disappoint.  Emails were usually answered in 24 hours. The biggest issue I had was its sensitivity to interfering signals.  Turn off auto connect on your wifi settings, and turn on Airplane mode, if possible, AFTER connecting to the drone. Pay very close attention to the details and sequence of the preflight checklist, and you should have a lot of fun.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O3iWQ5MuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O3iWQ5MuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O3iWQ5MuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AF3E6FTB6IMPOM7VUPEL5DNF322Q,1658772716497,1,False

The return home button will take the drone up to about 95 feet before returning (in order to avoid obstacles) I had panicked when my drone went up at first<br />3.) If the drone isn't handling well, you probably didn't calibrate the GPS well (wait until all lights are solid)<br /><br />Oh and let me tell you my biggest surprise, last night my daughter and I went to fly the drone by the beach at sunset. I hit the video button and couldn't wait to get home to see the results.  Well guess what?  I forgot to put the SD card back in the drone.  To my amazement, the drone had sent the complete video wirelessly to my iPhone.  It was all there!  So cool!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tMmUxz9xL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tMmUxz9xL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tMmUxz9xL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHSMB4RVHSUMOGSUZTZFWVOLKAFQ,1573930397395,0,True

632,5.0,5 Star Customer Service,"[Background]  I bought this quad-copter drone to be able to visually inspect hard to reach places like my gutters and the back-side of my chimney.  My house’s height challenges my 35-foot extension ladder in some spots and the trees around here have grown so tall over 20 years that leaves in gutter is a problem.<br /><br />[Features / Performance]  I’m new to drones and the aerial inspections I want to do require some skill.  So, I watched a lot of YouTube videos and realize some drones are very good at making up for inexperience.  HS720 appeared to be one of those for a fraction of the cost.  I started out practicing in open fields and parks to develop the reflex and hand coordination to make multi-axial maneuvers.  When this drone locks on to at least 7 GPS satellites, it is amazing how stable it is even in mild winds (4-10 MPH).  The flying modes of Point-to-Point Tap Fly, Follow-me and hover & rotate over Point of Interest, are very impressive.  The return to home feature works quite well and is very intelligent as it accounts for remaining battery energy.  I found one YouTube video demonstrating a Return-To-Home landing (Holystone HS720 GPS Camera Drone) where the drone literally landed exactly where it took off (see 9:20 minutes into the video).  I tried this several times and the closest it came to the mat for me was within 3 feet (so I’m not complaining at all).  But it was a jaw dropping demo when I watched it.<br /><br />[Customer Service]  The best part:  I did have one issue with the drone after flying it 9-10 times (erratic behavior).  It resulted in some physical problems with the craft.  So, I picked up the phone right away and called Holy Stone US.  BEST CUSTOMER CARE service ever!  The rep. on the phone asked me some basic questions, verified my purchase.  This was a non-routine problem and she had to defer to someone else in-house a couple of times while we were on the phone.  She asked that I take and email to her photos of the craft and she waited for them to arrive in her email box (while we were on the phone).  The “experts” looked at the photos and gave me an immediate resolution; all in the same 15-minute phone call.  This completely satisfied me (wowed my spouse in the process).  Who does that anymore?<br /><br />[NOTE:  Before Use]  Do be sure to remove all the surface protective plastic “stickers”.  They are on the hand-held control screen, the frontal camera lens, one on each of the bottom LED lights and a donut shaped one lens on the imaging positioning camera on the bottom.  This last one is important because this lens utilizes color contrast beneath the drone to gauge its horizontal stability/position when near the ground (I guess that means less than 2 meters above ground).  Lastly, there is a foam pad that goes around the battery which comes inserted in the drone.  You must remove this before the battery will insert fully into the drone.  I did not find that step anywhere in the manual.  If you manage to get the battery to connect with the foam insert in place. It will slip out (killing power if in flight).<br /><br />[Performance Against Purpose]  I did get videos of my roof and gutters (See attached photo taken from video).  I inserted a SanDisk 32GB HC I SD card.  I doubt this is a Class 10 SD card which is what Holy Stone recommends.  I don’t know what “class” my memory card is, but looking at the video and video freeze frames, I was able to determine where along my gutters I do need to place the ladder to remove leaves.  The drone took very clear video images from maybe 10-20 feet above the gutter line.  A Class 10 SD card might be even better quality.  However, this made me very happy.  No attempt to inspect the back-side of chimney as I will have to fly “blind” and rely on the altimeter and camera only.  I suspect I will need to prove myself in a lot more flight tests before ready to try that.<br /><br />[Battery Life / Recharging]  can drone on and on (pun) about how nice this craft is, but I am really not qualified enough to give a good technical critique yet.  I will leave that to the YouTube demonstrators.  I will say that what they claim about this vehicle has been true in my limited 5 days (about 9 flights) of use.  I know the biggest complaint is the 5-7 hrs of charge time on the battery.  Yup, its true.  It is about 5-7 Hrs.  I don’t know about actual maximum flight time as I’ve not pushed it.  As I’m learning, I generally develop a flight plan consisting of a 4-6 maneuvers (wind stability, elevation stability when flying over objects, targeted video capture, etc) and then call it quits.  I’ve flown this up to about 15 minutes.  Those recharges required about 3-4 Hrs to complete.<br /><br />[Instruction Manual]  These are more important that many people know.  This one is written is clear English and there is a downloadable .pdf one available too.  Read the manual several times.  There are some nice fail-safe features, some behaviors that I would not have anticipated (like cruise altitudes for Return-To-Home), and cautions that make reading the manual valuable.  Example:  the drone will not avoid obstacles in its path when in Return-to-Home mode.  I do highly recommend watching others on YouTube use this drone before flying it if you are new to drones.  You have to be smart when flying and think ahead.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iR78NwcuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iR78NwcuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iR78NwcuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AF3VZJCSIFRBLYZG76QKFCSEQG5A,1573311671342,87,True

644,4.0,Easy To Learn,"[[VIDEOID:3d51b17ffd2f5cb9ad696cde9aad4fe4]] Took my first flight with the Holy Stone HS720 on our private shooting range in South Jersey.  I am not an experienced drone operator however I was pleasantly surprised by the maneuverability of the drone.  As long as one keeps proper perspective of the forward facing position of the drone, it is relatively easy to fly.  In the video attached you will see that I am flying in heavy tree cover.  I have not tried many of the features such as return to home or follow me because I was concerned that if the drone malfunctioned I would destroy it by crashing into a tree or lose it in the heavy woodland.  My only disappoint at this time is the video stabilization or lack there of as these lower cost drones do not have a gimble type floating camera system.  You will see as the drone maneuvers, there is very little stabilization of the video.  Another concern is the video quality but again for a lower priced drone I suppose it is good enough.  I purchased this for $225. with promotional discount and so far for the money it's worth it.

I have emailed Holy Stone customer service twice before I received the drone and they are very quick to reply.

Not a big deal once you know.<br />Now the App takes some getting used too but that is expected. Not difficult but will need some practice.<br />To me the picture quality is good to great IMO, for the price what do you want.<br />As with most of the comments, I agree battery charge time can be long. As it arrived my battery only required two hours charge to get a steady green light(full charge). The option to buy a kit with 2 batteries would have been a plus. Currently no batteries to be found on Amazon but customer service said they should be back in stock in a few weeks. Today is 10/04/2019 as I am writing this.<br />In conclusion I think this a great beginner drone or more. I bought this to learn and one day by a top of the line for cinematic production.

671,5.0,Fantastic first drone,"So far, the HS-720 is meeting all of the high expectations I had prior to purchasing it. It is very easy to fly, holds a stable hover, even in some wind. The build quality is high, especially at this price point. My only wish is for an increased ability maintaining FPV connectivity. Granted, it is performing as advertised, however, I would like a range that more closely matches the range of the 2.4 GHz of the controller. Since the 5GHz does NOT use the controller antennas, you are limited by your phone and the  5GHz radio. With the 5GHz spectrum being easily degraded by trees, for example. I am looking to add a better antenna to the 720 to see if it helps at all. While the camera is not on a 3-axis gimbal, I believe it does provide high enough quality for some photography and, with decent editing, some video as well.<br />I recommend this drone to anyone who is looking to get a good taste of FPV or a good all-round drone that provides a good bang for your buck.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHBHSPRW2WAIJ6AMD6V5P6UDLSZQ,1598123056116,0,True

673,4.0,Just read it.,"Updating review from 2 stars to 4 stars. I'd honestly give it 3.5 if I could.<br /><br />I received the HS720 on 4/26/2020. It was packaged very nicely. The battery was charged. I took it out. Calibrated it. 17 satellites displayed on the Drone. App was easy to connect. Video came through fine. Controls were great.<br /><br />I charged it for about 5 hours and flew again. This time the Drone wouldn't hover it would just drift off or go all the way to the ground. It wasn't very windy. The worst issue was that it would only fly backwards. Whenever I would try to fly it forwards it was very unresponsive. When I flew backwards it was very responsive and took off. The only way to bring the drone back to me was to hit the return to home button or fly it backwards to me.<br /><br />I charged it over night and tried again the next morning, same problem. I called Holy Stone and they wanted me to record a video of the Drone not flying forward. Like an idiot I tried, but that was impossible to do while holding the transmitter and trying to record the drone. So to avoid fighting with Holy Stone over a drone I had only owned for 2 days I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. Amazon deserves most of the credit here for its great customer service. They gave me a return label and shipped me a new drone. The new drone works well so far.<br /><br />After I posted my original 2 star review a HS employee (June) emailed me and asked about the review. I explained and told her I had already sent it back to Amazon. She offered to make it right by sending me a free replacement battery which she did. So she made up for what the original guy screwed up when it comes to service.<br /><br />Now to the drone. It flies great. It's very small so when it's windy is doesn't fly as good. The orbit, return to home, and point map features all works great. The follow me feature works but not so good. I can outrun the drone and it won't keep up.<br /><br />The video quality is just OK. Definitely not crystal clear but good for beginners.<br /><br />The batteries take about 5 hours minimum to fully charge. When I received the second spare battery I ordered I could smell the lithium so I wouldn't charge them over night or when I'm not home.<br /><br />Once you learn the routine of calibrating every time you turn it on it becomes easy. You have to calibrate for satellites every time you turn it on or put in a new battery.<br /><br />Lots of features in the app as well including flight logs and gyro calibrations.<br /><br />I would recommend the drone. The initial interaction with HS customer service left a bad taste in my mouth but the second employee (June) came in and saved the day for their reputation with me.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGKARNOGIZJ5O3W7L7QCPRYHMMHQ,1587995854060,0,True

I was so excited when I got it that I almost when out and flew it.  BUT I watched some good videos of what to do and not to do when you are starting out .

676,5.0,My first camera drone and its awesome !!,"Just decided to try and fly a drone.<br />Looked online at different options and the HS72 came clearly ahead.<br />As a beginner, I am more than impressed with this drone. it is easy to fly (just make sure you read the manual) and it takes decent pictures and videos. the lack of gimbal is made up by the rubber damper on the camera. It is very very adequate and the images are pretty stable.<br />Again, it's a beginner's drone, there are better but pricier drones out there.

677,5.0,UPDATE: Amazing Drone for beginners and intermediate users alike. THANKS HOLYSTONE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"UPDATE (LONG):<br /> I have been recommending this particular Holystone drone to everyone that sees me flying it, and I can do it in all honesty.  We have had some very windy weather lately, so I have been hesitant to fly it in such conditions (I have flown it in gusts of up to 25 mph). We finally got some a beautiful, calm weather, so I took it to a different place with some beautiful scenery.  When I got it ready to fly, finished the calibration and had 10 satellites locked in (I usually fly with 13-14).  When it took off, I could not control it at all, with the controller or with my 5G iPhone. It was if it were not connected.  I tried to shut it down completely, but it was flying toward some bushes and starting to get higher.  It finally hit the bushes and that stopped it.  It was time for me to go home, so I packed it up and returned home.  Later that afternoon, I went to fly it again, and it would not connect to my iPhone.  I seemed that the built-in WIFI was not working.  I tried everything that I knew how to do, tried 3 other phones, including an Android phone, but the HolystoneFPV_***** network never showed on any of the phones.<br />I contacted Holystone via email, and explained the problem.  The next day I received a very nice email from Fiona who asked me to send some screenshots. Let me make this shorter as it is a long story.  I sent the first email on March 26th. and had this continued over the course of a week.  Fiona was very polite and it was obvious that she wanted to help.  I just was not understanding what she wanted as I had tried to explain it as succinctly as possible. It made me wish that I had gotten my degree in Chinese Linguistics rather than German.  Finally I told her that I thought there was a problem with a language barrier. The next day I got a very nice email from Vivian, who had an excellent command of English, and again I sent her screenshots and videos.  This went on for a few more days, until I received an email from Nicole, who basically asked me the same questions and wanted the same screenshots and videos.  Finally I received further communication from Vivian, saying that she was applying for a replacement drone  for me.<br />Several days when by without any further communication, until I got a message on April 6th, that the replacement would arrive on April 10th.  I have read almost all of these reviews stating how great Holystone Customer Service is and I can confirm it today.  If you have a problem, they will take care of it, it may seem that you are caught in an endless loop, but they will come through for you.  THANK YOU HOLYSTONE and to all of the customer relations agents that I corresponded with.  YOU ARE GREAT!<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /> With a few notable exceptions, this drone is able to be used by beginner or intermediate user. When I first received it the battery was only partially charged, so I put it on charge and since it was late (the battery takes 5 to 7 hrs to charge Fully) I left it overnight and went to bed.  The next day a norther blew in and though the battery was fully charged, I being a beginner spent the afternoon reading the manual. It was 2 days later when the weather was good enough to chance a flight. Then I realized that due to its weight I would have to get an FAA license. This was easy enough going through the FAA website. Cost was only $5.00. I looked at every video on YouTube an between some confusion in the instruction manual and some confusion in the videos about the Lock button, I could not get it to fly. So another day passes and I finally figured out the lock button and I got it to fly!  Got a full 30 minute flight out of the battery. The default setting is beginner mode. With this I am geofenced at 49 feet height, 49 feet distance and 49 feet radius around a point of interest. This is great for me as a beginner. As I improve I can turn off the beginner mode and set the height, distance and circling radius.<br />Some of the reviews stated that they could not get the follow me to work. I however did not have a problem. I was able to use the map to set waypoints on the screen which the drone then followed. You must remember to zoom in on the map. If you want 4K pictures and video you must use a TFT (miniSD card, NO LARGER THAN 32 gigs). Otherwise,  it will save a lower resolution to your phone. You can fly the drone without your phone., using only the controller. If you take it out of the beginner mode and set the height to a great distance, the connection with the phone may be lost but you will still have the drone connected to the transmitter. This is a great feature as you can still press return to home and get your drone back. The more GPS satellites that you can connect to the better you will be able to get your drone to return to you. Since I was not sending it out very far or sending it very high I had no problem with the return to home. I don't know how it will be when I take it out of beginner mode and start flying it higher.<br />I will be having weekly updates to this review as I fly it more and learn more about it. Holystone has very good customer service, and if you purchase one of these do not hesitate to leave them an email or give them a call.<br />UPDATE:<br />it has been very windy here in San Antonio, Texas. Decided to go out with a 12 mile per hour wind gusting to 18 and went to high speed flying and spent 20 minutes dealing with the geofencing. Finally I got bold and I turned off beginners mode. Left the height at 49 feet but change my distance so that I could go further out. In the beginner mode you are geofenced in height, distance and POI. I'm not ready to go much higher, however,  I would like to go out as far as I can see. After I turned off and adjusted the distance it was much more enjoyable Before it was like the drone ran into a brick wall and just stopped. I couldn't turn it around, but could bank it left and right and go backward that was it. I could press return to home and it would go back home but that distance limitation was annoying. So this at least will let me use follow me easier now. Just remember that when you turn off beginner mode you can adjust each one of your parameters to  define what is right for you.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFPP7JQ2VGCGAOY5VAWETRTM5D2A,1614926262709,0,True

679,5.0,More fun the second time around,"Ok, so this is my second review of this drone.  My first HS720 was given as a gift to my nephew. He's had it for about 10 days and absolutely loves it. He's done stuff with it that I didn't get a chance to do, however, I will post some updated photos once I get more time. Now.. on to the review.<br /><br />The Holy Stone HS720 is my first purchase of a drone/quadracopter over $100 and I am pleasantly surprised of all the options that are available. It is definitely a step up over the ""toy"" drones I've had in the past. The build is a lot more solid and the stability in even strong winds really impressed me. I like the compactness of the drone and the way it stores easily. The folding is easy and has clear instructions on how to fold it.<br /><br />As mentioned before, prior to purchasing the first HS720 I had not heard of HolyStone or any of its drone models, however, when I started looking and comparing, the price seemed a lot better than the competitors. It had everything I was looking for and more: long-range communication, better-than-HD video, long battery life, and Return To Home option. The remote/radio controller fits my phone (Samsung S8+) very well. I like the remote because it is not too cluttered and I fly with little effort.<br /><br />As soon as I received the second model, I unboxed it and started flying it around. This time I was able to kill the battery after 15 minutes. The recharge time was still pretty long (6.25 hours) from dead to completely full charge. The second day I was able to flight it around on breezy day at some heights over 60 ft. I could see where the self-stabalization would engage whenever the wind would pick up. In less than a second, the drone was stable and steady. I have to work on my landings, however, the drone has held up like a champ.<br /><br />One of the other options is the ""follow me"" mode and ""point of interest"" mode. Both worked well once I played with some of the settings. I'm sure they'll come in handy once I start using this for commercial photos and videos.<br /><br />Overall, great product, great build, great materials. Easy to use and easy to learn. One of the biggest features that i wish this drone had is object avoidance like other manufacturers. This way I could fly with less apprehensiveness. Would definitely recommend as a personal gift or a gift to others. This is a perfect drone for a beginner or the next level up.<br /><br />Also, their customer service is very helpful with questions and other requests I've had for them. They are well-informed and very friendly.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616p1kYT89L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616p1kYT89L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616p1kYT89L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712c5tYhWSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712c5tYhWSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712c5tYhWSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716-cKmPgYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716-cKmPgYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716-cKmPgYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717tbabqLfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717tbabqLfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717tbabqLfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dbmz5QxkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dbmz5QxkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dbmz5QxkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J6aW2HdIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J6aW2HdIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J6aW2HdIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KFZvZhJKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KFZvZhJKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KFZvZhJKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P3i8HaHZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P3i8HaHZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71P3i8HaHZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e14orzPjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e14orzPjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71e14orzPjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kiVr7lb+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kiVr7lb+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kiVr7lb+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71spbY5gR2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71spbY5gR2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71spbY5gR2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jKkDdOGYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jKkDdOGYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jKkDdOGYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEVNC4MVOU4KLZ7YKAWDBG45TCIQ,1574720210510,1,True

Suddenly and without warning at about 200 feet the drone went completely dead and crashed from that height. Due to know fault of my own.  I've attached photos of the complete wreckage of the quadcopter.<br />  At this time I am asking you to replace this faulty drone for a new identical make and model at no charge to me.<br />  Before I purchased this product I read in the reviews very high ratings for your customer support.

711,5.0,First Drone had a mind of its own. Replacement is great,"I will preface this review with the information that I’m a retired military and commercial airline pilot rated in both jet aircraft and helicopters. With that said I will explain my one star rating. On my third flight after a photo session, I was at a three foot stabilized hover, ready to land, when the drone started a vertical climb. All attempts to stop it failed. At approximately 50 feet AGL, The drone leveled off and started a lateral movement to my left. Again, I had no control. It continued on that course until it hit a tree branch and became stuck. The engines continued to run as I was not able to shut it down. After about 45 seconds, the engines stopped. At that point it dislodged from the tree and fell to the ground. Upon inspection, I discovered the left rear engine and pod had separated from its arm.<br />I tried calling a Holy Stone several times, always getting a recording. I then decided to try email. After 24 hours I got a reply back saying they would send me the repair parts and I could install them. They then emailed me a link to a video on how to replace the arm. It requires tools that I did not have. I have emailed them two more times telling them I needed to return the drone for repair. No reply. I have called four more times today leaving messages and no return call. I have contacted amazon with this information and I’m waiting for their reply. I love the drone. What it did scares me about future mishaps if I ever get it repaired.<br />I hope to upgrade my one star rating at a later date. Time will tell.<br /><br />As I said previously, I hope to update this. As usual, Amazon came through with their great support. They authorized me to return the drone for a full refund. I was finally contacted by a Holy Stone. It’s important to note here that I was informed they do not repair their drones. You either have to repair it yourself after they send you the parts, or you can return it to them for a credit. Exactly what type of credit I’m not sure. After al, this, I have ordered a different manufactures drone. I am waiting for delivery and will evaluate after I have put it through it’s paces. Whatever happens, I know Amazon will back it up.<br /><br />The saga continues. In a further update, Holy Stone has replaced the drone even after I returned it for a refund from Amazon. They have been very good since the HS 720 project manager got involved. The new drone arrived today. I’m charging the battery now and will fly it our first nice day. More to follow.<br /><br />The new drone performs as advertised. I’m very satisfied with it and their great customer service. They have been very responsive to all my needs.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a5ghWAKgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a5ghWAKgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a5ghWAKgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718Dj6dQf0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718Dj6dQf0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718Dj6dQf0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AF2TBJ6GWAYSBEZ2YZWSYINS57EQ,1577746257286,0,True
712,5.0,I LOVE my HolyStone HS720,"A friend of mine spent over $500 for a Mavic Mini. We raced them, saw which one went higher and further, which pictures were better and my HS720 won by a LOT in all categories. The HS720 flew 3x higher and at least 3x further than the more expensive Mavic Mini. It's easy to control (it's my first drone so I'm no expert), has great GPS that prevents the wind from making it fly away and it always comes back to me regardless of how far away I fly it or even if I don't see where it went. It's really incredible. The best bang for your buck for a drone, easily.<br /><br />I will also add that my first drone had a defective issue and stopped flying after a month.

716,2.0,Into the night without a trace.....,"After purchasing this drone twice and before I really had adequate time to fully immerse myself in getting to know the drone on my first purchase an accident of my own fault left the drone inoperable. Second go around was not a good experience, my hs720 seemed very glitchy and lacked consistent operation from the get go. A normal flight consisted of the drone not always coming on and staying on, or connecting with the actual included remote itself. When I would get the drone in the air, it would hover in a large circle and during flight it was never stable enough to take photos that weren't lopsided, and video was so shaky watching playback was enough to make anyone feel queasy with all the movement back and forth or side to side. Finally, while visiting a nearby recreational off roading area, my suv became stuck in a sandy area leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere practically forcing me to walk a few miles to get help to pull my vehicle out of the sandtrap I had inadvertently got stuck in. Before walking to get help from friends, I thought hey I can use my hs720 on follow me mode to help me get back to the other off roaders to be seen or see where I'm going, because to make matters more interesting this all happened right after sundown. Got my drone all calibrated, and ready to go, connected, 14gps signals, and off to sky, landing lights were bright and really helped light up the now pitch black night giving me a very confident sense of safety...and then my hs720 took off the opposite way I was heading at lightning speed, I tried everything on the remote to stop it ,but it continued high speed until gone! Last time I ever saw the drone I was really beginning to like, however the flashlight I had in my hand now ranked on a much higher satisfaction scale than my, well what use to be my hs720 drone.<br />Interestingly enough, I was contacted by HS asking me to please take down my negative review of the drone with an offering of a refund or replacement drone, my choice. I opted to try out another drone, I thought this to be too good to be true and was super excited! After several emails with a very helpful and courteous CSR, I was all set to receive my replacement HS720! My package arrived quickly within 3days, I couldn't open the box fast enough to try this drone out with hopefully a much better experience...and then, THERE IT WASN'T! Instead of the HS720, shipping had screwed up my replacement order and shipped out the HS270 2.7k, brushed motor quadcopter, even the order slip inside the box had a full description of the HS720 model information as being what was shipped. I uploaded photo's to CS, and was asked to pay for return shipping to send this hs270 back, and once received then the correct drone will be sent out.<br />After all of this, then getting built up to receive a replacement then receiving a different drone completely, I was done and decided it was just not meant to be for me to have or own an hs720 : (  I told the CSR if it were ok I'll would just keep the hs270 and leave it at that (being I live in a very small town with the closest UPS store 67 miles away) if this would be acceptable. That was completely fine with HS, and they also issued me a partial refund of $70 which was considerate. My first purchase was short lived due to accidental damage, and the second gone with the wind, and the third....completely wrong drone.

718,4.0,WORTH... wait for.... IT!!!!,"Honestly, I was initially concerned after reading some of the reviews and what occurred to them when I first ordered this device. However, I opted to give it a shot. After having it out for three days and 15 flights for total of over 3 hours of enjoyment, I am happy to provide the following:<br /><br />As a former PARROT 2.0 and other micro Drone owner, not only has the technology advanced by leaps and bounds on drones (micro or otherwise), the cost was almost 'too good to be true'. Upon receipt of the prompt delivery, it was obvious the packaging was solid, in-spite of being clearly handled roughly in transit. (i.e. exterior of packaging was torn/damaged as was original box, but the contents remained unharmed from external damage, due to the foam padded Carrying Case included.)<br /><br />After reviewing the manual (a couple of times...), charging the battery and taking it out for a few flights, by day THREE of using drone, it was easy to handle and manage for a distance of about 300ft. (only because I haven't FULLY learned how to properly extend the limits on this yet) The video tutorials provided from the in app ""HELP"" are enlightening and extremely helpful to review prior to first FLIGHT. The ""HOME"" return button is a LIFE SAVER! Still working w/settings and how to establish better flight patterns and use of 'follow-me' feature(s). The tilt feature on the camera is amazing, as is the quality of the imagery and video produced (contingent  upon connectivity too). Easy to learn and use controls (w/iPhone adaptable controller).<br /><br />While the controller fits well in 'Medium' sized hands, since it has to link to iPhone/Android device, iPads are not feasibly used (by single individual w/o prior proper planning and programming flight paths). If you want or need something larger to view LIVE FLIGHT on WHILE in use, be advised this controller barely accommodates the iPhoneXR (w/o its protective case).<br /><br />The flight time is quite extensive (especially compared to outdated Parrot 2.0 Drone, by technological default) so it makes getting the video/images desired easier and not so rushed. While some vibration may be seen in the video when increasing/decreasing altitude (as well as w/any fast movement)... Still shots are AMAZING!<br /><br />As the fourth kind of ""Drone"" acquired, this has been my best experience thus far. HIGHLY ENCOURAGED for those who wish to see things from a different perspective (w/o 'breaking the bank'). Despite AMAZON's suggestion to upload images, their system isn't currently accepting anything from Apple/ iPhone (HEIC) .jpg, or .jpeg. lest they reveal their 'limitations' for uploads. I have both, but neither is acceptable upload for AMAZON... YET!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHB6XYCIEHHOLLY7U34JNHLYW2ZA,1610754880382,1,True

729,5.0,Drone Batteries,"Not a review, but more of a discussion about drone batteries.<br /><br />It looks like a really nice drone.  Nice features and looks.<br />However, this drone like many others have<br />proprietary battery packs that are insanely expensive.<br />Also, with charge times of upwards of 5 hours, that's pretty long.<br /><br />For me, this puts a serious damper on me buying these<br />types of drones.  Now if they had a empty battery case that could be fitted with your own LiPo/Li-ion batteries<br />that would be great.  Also, to have the ability to charge with hobby grade battery chargers would be great.<br />Even better would be an over the counter regular hobby battery pack with an ec2 connector and a balance charge connector.<br /><br />In summary, the Holy Stone HS720 may be a great drone, but my Husban H501SS Professional uses regular hobby batteries with ec2 and balance charge connector for around 10 - 15 dollars.  Also it has a very nice FPV LCD built into the controller.<br />All for under $200.<br /><br />Don't let me dissuade your buying decisions.

743,5.0,"Great drone, tons of features and great price!","When I received my first HS720 and was a little disappointed when I opened the Amazon box. The HS720 package was damaged. I removed it from the Amazon box and found the box was opened. I was getting more upset the further into the unboxing I went. Sure enough, the drone had damage as well. And it looked as if it had been flown and wrecked. I boxed it back up and requested a replacement from Amazon.<br /><br />My replacement arrived yesterday. Unboxing went well. No damage at all. It was in perfect condition.<br /><br />I charged up the battery and started reading. Once the battery was full I went outside and followed the pairing and initialization process. It was very quick and straight forward.<br /><br />Struggled a bit to use my phone with the remote. The holder would not grip my phone with the case on it. I ended up putting an older phone with no case in the holder and that worked. Since that phone isn't active I was not able to use the GPS functions. Once you connect to the drone you cannot use your home wifi... I think I'll get a Tracfone SIM to be able to use data while I fly.<br /><br />Operating the drone was straight up easy. I need to get more familiar with all the new controls. I had the drone up and over the yard and house. The flight was very stable and I got my first in-flight video. The picture quality was ok. I found an old memory card and put it in. I'll use that to capture video and photos. I think having to transmit and record to the phone impacts quality.<br /><br />flew for about 20 minutes and got the first low battery notice. I pressed the Return to Home button and it flew to the spot I took off from.<br /><br />The photos I included were from the first drone and it’s unboxing. The last one with my EarPods is the new one.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with the HS720! Now I need a spare battery!<br /><br />Update 1/15/2020<br />Picked up a Tracfone SIM and activated my old phone ... I am having some difficulties with the APP and the drone.  It appears there are some known bugs with Samsung Android phones.  I will try moving the SIM card from the Samsung to an old iPhone 5 and see if that works better.<br /><br />I was having a heck of a time trying to get a video to save to the memory card.  Apparently there is memory card size limitation of 32GB.  No videos would save to my 128GB Samsung SD card.  I ordered a 32GB card.  Will try that to capture videos. I could store photos and download them with no issue.<br /><br />Flight time yesterday was around 20 minutes.  It was a little breezy and i noticed the flight was not as steady as it had been on earlier flights on calmer days.  I was still able to fly around the yard and maneuver easily.  I was a little hesitant to go up over the house without the APP working correctly on my Samsung.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/310GLGyvVgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/310GLGyvVgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/310GLGyvVgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/313Y+ZgZLIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/313Y+ZgZLIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/313Y+ZgZLIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31OzayGGC4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31OzayGGC4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31OzayGGC4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31XkRm21EHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31XkRm21EHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31XkRm21EHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31jokJ03nwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31jokJ03nwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31jokJ03nwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AF3TWZN2XSSVHR6PDDN7VFR5QHGQ,1578920627033,0,True

748,2.0,Great drone for beginners,I like the Holy Stone drone if you are new to drones because you fly with care and slow movement of the new drone. This makes learning to fly a drone sweet. But as you advance your skills the drone doesn’t respond the way you need it to respond. This will confuse you because you feel like the drone is not working right as your skills develop. Once I tried a higher end drone that responded to my command I found that it’s not my drone it’s me and my skills have developed so once I bought a higher end drone I was happy but not for the cost. I still have my Holy Stone and I still fly it but when I fly it I fly it slow and get some great pictures from it. One other thing expect to crash! So fly it in the biggest open space you can. Once you have learned how to control it then fly it around your house or other places that have obstruction.

767,4.0,Great drone for the money!,This is a great little drone for the money.  I’ve had a phantom 3 before and I think this flies just as well as my DJI.  It drifts just a little more probably due to it not being as heavy.  The remote seems to be pretty good.  Wish it would open just a little wider to hold your cell phone.  I have an IPhone 11 but had to take it out of the case for it to fit.  I’m working on my Part 107 and being new to flying a drone I wanted something not too expensive just in case of crashes (which I did trim a small tree today!).  This drone works great for a beginner.  I’ve posted pictures but I’ve marked my info out just for picture purposes.  This also cones with a nice case too and a compartment to hold my owners manuals and my logbook.

770,4.0,Save for the “name brand” until HS uses a real gimbal,Wife got it for my birthday overall is fine for a beginner drone.  You will crash it mine broke on first flight when the return to home function tried to keep up with a constantly moving gps signal it ignored all my commands from 80 ft away with the controller and did what it wanted while coming down..customer service is very good and kind and sent a replacement arm for free which is appreciated.  I fly freestyle quads so im not a newbie didnt like that i didnt have full control even with the remote..device needs a kill switch holding the arm switch down for 3 seconds is supposed to turn off the motors but 3 seconds is a long time when the drone randomly does what it wants..  biggest complaint is the gimbal system it doesnt exist its only a vibration dampener which does absorb motor vibration but you will still get motion sickness watching a video it is not a smooth sailer. The camera is actually pretty good for the price my pics are from the images it saved to my phone not from the onboard sd card which are cleaner images forgot to load it for this flight. The battery is also very good and i have yet to even finish a battery before i get bored and nervous that the thing might take off into restricted airspace.HolyStone put on a real gimbal and a kill switch and beef up the video antennas and it will a very real competitor to those other guys..but in the end i really want a stable image on a “cinematic” drone so i gotta dump more money on the competition.

It hovers rock solid even in winds.The photos and video I have uploaded here were shot in less than ideal weather on both day I have been able too fly it was 30 degrees outside and quiet windy I cant wait too fly this spring I know its going too be amazing. The flight time on mine is almost 30 minutes that's a lot of air time I do need too find another battery though before spring gets here. I suppose if I wish one thing was different would be the recharge time was quicker (need a second battery). This is a very good quality solid drone tons of power.

823,4.0,Holy Stone HS720.,"[[VIDEOID:7896d0bcc87283ed940aef2917d55b5]] This is my second drone from holy stone. The first one I bought was the new HS270. Although it's the newest model it's not better than the HS720. With that said I am not impressed with this drone. The very first time I flew this drone and hit the take off button it hovered at about 4' for a few seconds and then made a hard turn right in to my BBQ that was 6' away.<br /><br />The second time I flew it it hovered ok but had a hard time staying in one spot.  After ascending the drone and flying around a bit the inputs were very delayed.  During a turn either by yaw or axis, when I let go of the sticks the drone would continue to move for a several feet before stopping and then returning to the point where I stopped giving input. There was times the drone started to fly away and lower in altitude without any input.<br /><br />I ascended a couple hundred feet all within the line of sight and completely lost connection with my phone. The controller still worked, but if I hadn't had a line of sight I could have lost orientation of the drone.<br /><br />Camera; now I realize this is not a 3 axis gimbal,  but this camera is awful (video attached using point of interest mode). It's very unstable with terrible quality.<br /><br />This is a good drone maybe GPS positioning is bad; I don't know.<br /><br />Update: After flying this for a 3rd time. It crashed into a tree and broke the arm. Sadly I was told there are no replacement parts to purchase in order to repair. Holystone said to send a photo and reason for the crash. As of now I am still waiting on a reply from HS.<br /><br />Update: Holystone's customer service is spot on. After telling them about the crash they followed up with some additional questions. I actually thought they were covering their warranty only to tell sorry they're was nothing more to do but low and behold I was sent an email stating they were sending me another drone, wow mind blown. On top of that they told me to keep the broken drone for parts. I was very impressed. This was all taken care within a 24 hour period.<br /><br />I hope they continue with their progress and come out with a 3 axis gimbal camera drone.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHGI7F5VDRZNGKG2CFOWP7M3D2UA,1571520249359,13,True

This is my first drone and so far, I've had no problems getting used to it. I had to make sure I took it out at least twice before writing my review so I could give you an honest opinion. This unit will take off and land itself, includes optical flow sensor, follow me mode, orbit, headless flight and if you get stuck you can just release the controls and it'll stabilize itself. I was very impressed at how it handled windy conditions, even in low-speed mode. Extra windy conditions will cause higher battery drain but its rated flight time is pretty darn close to the rated 26 minutes but I was afraid to take it too low and ended flight at around 18 minutes. I had a blast with this drone but be aware it's weight means it'll need to be registered with the FAA which is easy enough! HolyStone drones are really neat maybe my next one will be a gimbaled model but even this one, without EIS or gimbal takes pretty decent images and videos!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w3CXlZq5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w3CXlZq5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w3CXlZq5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHHL7GJII53PRMTEETYSAOR5EQGQ,1659269907411,1,True

Once the flying started I got about 7-8 minutes before the ""low battery"" warning began to flash on my screen. I've only cycled them through about 3 times (full use/recharge) but I'm very disappointed. Not sure if I'm going to replace this with a different brand, or possibly purchase new batteries.

846,4.0,"Lots of fun, with a few flaws","This is my first drone, so take this review with a grain of salt.  It was ordered for me by my wife on her account, so this review may not indicate ""verified purchase"", or whatever.<br />I picked this drone for its good reviews and reasonable price, and I am mostly not disappointed.  It was easy to learn, is fun to fly, and takes nice pictures and video.  Each battery is rated at 26 minutes flight time and I think this is accurate.  That said, a battery takes 5+ hours to charge, so having two is a must, I think.<br />The charging system is the weakest part of the package, I think.  The batteries plug in awkwardly and loosely into a bar with metal prongs.  The physical connection is not secure and the battery easily falls away if jostled.  On my unit, the green light does not stop flashing and turn solid as it should to indicate a full charge.  I am not sure if the fault is in the battery or the charger.  I will call Holy Stone customer support to get more information.<br />Also, Holy Stone does not include the brick to plug into the wall outlet; you have to provide that separately.  I realize a lot of companies have taken this route but we have so many of these at home already, BUT, Holy Stone makes a point (in the manual) that it should be 5V 2A.  Many charging bricks are 5V 1A and would presumably charge even more slowly.  Others have a higher amp rating.  Can they be used safely without causing problems, eg overheating or damaging the battery?  Holy Stone doesn't say.  If it is important, Holy Stone should have provided a brick.  As it is, check to see what you have when you order this drone.<br />The range of the controller to the drone is about 3000 feet.  Plenty far enough for me.  However, the range for the FPV (first person view) using the camera is much less than that.  For this one has to connect one's phone to a WiFi hotspot generated from the drone in phone settings, then open an app called Ophelia GO.  This app displays what the camera sees.  The range for the WiFi signal is not nearly as far.  So, while one is flying the controller beeps and the image disappears from the app.  Reconnecting to WiFi is a kludge.  Holy Stone says nothing about this in the documentation.<br />The app has a few problems.  One can change a few settings, eg from metric (default) to imperial, and some flight parameters can also be changes as well.  And distance must be changed or else one can only fly 50' away.  But these changes don't ""stick.""  Closing and then reopening the app returns them to the defaults.<br />So, even with these complaints, am I having fun?  Am I glad of our purchase?  Yes to both.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGQX4GO5F75JWHYVF62ZI7FC7H7A,1672706179596,0,False

848,5.0,Excellent drone for the money!,"This drone has exceeded my expectations.  I was originally looking at the Mavic Mini and then ran across this model by Holy Stone.  After further research and actually contacting Holy Stone I gave the HS720 a try.  Sure glad I did.  I spent less on the HS720 and got features the Mavic Mini did not have.  I highly recommend this model as it has a no risk trial period and is packed with nice features for the price point.  The battery charge time may be a bit longer than some desire, however it is at a price point where you can afford additional batteries and get some nice features that a Mavic Mini does not have.  BTW, the Mavic mini does not have a 4K camera and the HS720 takes awesome video and photos.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PO4RorTsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PO4RorTsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PO4RorTsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IzDcfoeDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IzDcfoeDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81IzDcfoeDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lrOj4e9WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lrOj4e9WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lrOj4e9WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEZUPFDG73WZ7ZQIW5Y3PTMB65RQ,1598156996994,0,True

Practice these flight controls and continue to grow comfortable seeing it move as you want it to move.  It is very forgiving flight Drone and always wants to float in the sky.

I am a first time drone pilot and did a copious amount of research before purchasing this product. First, when it arrived, I could tell it was not a ""toy"". It is heavily and strongly built, and I find the carrying case it comes with to be very convenient. Though initially I had a problem linking with it from my Samsung phone, it turned out I was just a little too far away from it, and after that, it was no problem at all to get  it linked and flying. Again, I am a novice, but it was no problem getting it into the air and learning the controls.

866,4.0,Customer Service 💯!,"Was in the market to buy a drone, went thru reviews on what seemed to be a rabbit hole of a multitude of diff types and manufacturers... all sold a fairly similar setup for each price range with each manufacturer having their own tweak to each drone product so as a 1st time user I wanted to keep it around $300 for trial and error purposes and reports of drones just going awol and missing, never know. I went with this HS720 because of the raves about customer service.  Let's face it, nobody wants to ever need to call CS but in times when you need to, you want them to...well, provide the customer good service!<br /><br />Truth be told, I did have intermittent issues with the one I received. Had fresh batteries, open area, 12-16 satellites, successful calibration, the whole 9yds. It seemed that every other time I put the drone off the ground it wanted to fly itself with no regard to the transmitter or controller. I would engage the button for auto take off, every time it would lift and sit about 6ft off the ground and hover perfect...for about 10 seconds.  with no fingers on the controls it would start pulling one direction or another then you could hear the motors ramp up to speeds exceeding what it uses when flying and then go until it hit something with no way to bring it back or land it safely. Now that was about every other time. The other times it flew gracefully and in full control, I'm not sure what the disconnect was because every time I went thru the same steps successfully to get it up (Fresh Batteries, Good GPS, Calibration).<br /><br />After a full day of hit and miss flights, it finally took damage and I say finally because I swore after each collision on its rogue adventures that it was done but this thing honestly just kept getting back up, it was quite impressive to be honest. It hit a pine tree at 50ft, smacked several branches on the way to the ground on one of its rogue flights and had suffered no damage! Like, the thing is damn tough, for real lol. The last crash was its easiest landing and that is the one that somehow broke it. It gave me a day of fun and intermittent frustrations but when it did fly under control it flew well.<br /><br />I contacted customer service about a week after coming back to town and emailed them what had been happening with it, I let them know that I was willing to pay for any damage that I caused as an error in my flying abilities but I wasn't okay with it if it was because of the drones inability to take commands from the transmitter. I knew I would have to invest money into something such as a drone for long term use and still willing to do so because this thing is awesome! After a few emails, they asked for me to send the unit back to them and they are sending me out a new one. Lemons happen people, no matter what it is in life that you buy or invest in but having people that stand by their products really means something.<br /><br />In short😄, if you're looking for a drone, get one from Holystone, whichever model fits your needs or level of expertise. The one factor that had me lean towards them to begin with is the one that is saving me now CUSTOMER SERVICE!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AH2P27TPI32U4LQVPNOMCNFHDMNA,1667655696004,1,False

875,5.0,"A+ drone, A+++ customer service","So this is my second drone, the first one also being a Holy Stone, slightly upgraded to this one. The controls are easy to use and understand, The control of the HS 720 is very good, even with a good wind, the GPS kept it within a foot of its original position at all times. The remote is very responsive and allows for the most delicate fine tune flying. The main use for my purchase is to examine house roofs so being able to fly slow and close without hitting anything is a definite plus, just don’t do it on windy days since wind currents are stronger closer towards building surfaces. The high resolution 4K camera  takes really good pictures, and with the ability to remotely angle the camera lens 90 degrees up and down makes taking pictures in different angles a breeze. The only issue I had was with the RTH “return to home” automated feature when the battery is low. There are two safety low-voltage RTHs. The first making sure that the drone is within your range and if not, goes within a specific range with the maximum height of 98 feet. The second low-voltage RTH automatically will land your drone and take it back to its original point of origin (where it took off) based on a GPS location. The only issue is that it’s not 100% accurate and in my situation, did some damage. Right before landing the drone the second low-voltage RTH took control of the drone and readjusted its location to land where it thought was the original location but instead went right into the side of a house causing it to fall. When the second low voltage RTH takes control, as far as I know, you can’t regain control of the drone because it’s basically in an emergency landing procedure. Word of advice, when the first low battery warning initiates, land your drone immediately if you’re surrounded by obstacles  like houses or trees. On the positive side, Holy stone customer service was beyond excellent. I found the email in the instruction booklet, sent a detailed message of what had happened and received a reply first thing the next morning completely dedicated to rectifying the situation and making sure that I was happy. Communication was fast and responsive and in the end, they sent me the parts required to fix the drone and a handy YouTube repair video.<br />With the Included features and the ease of flying, plus the excellent customer service, I would highly recommend the HS720 drone to anyone looking to purchase a higher end drone without the higher end price.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHQQIHGYRQKB42Q7XN4E5FW6JIYA,1596514396145,0,True

877,5.0,Longevity Review,"Just wanted to post a review after I had tested the drone.<br /><br />Ive now had the HS720 over a year.  I purchased it in November of 2019.  So Ive had it close to a year and a half.<br /><br />Ive used it approx 30 times in that year and a half and I have to say its held up exceptionally well.  I did have to purchase some additional props for it.  But other than that, the drone and the controller are in great shape.<br /><br />Alot of that comes from the nice storage case that is included with the drone.<br /><br />There are only two things id like to see improved upon.  The battery to charger connection could be a little more secure.  But not a deal breaker.  I just have to be careful once plugged in that I move it, or the connection might come undone.<br /><br />And of course the most common complaint of charging time.  5-7 hours.<br /><br />But again for the price savings you get from buying this drone.  And by savings I'm talking a couple hundred dollars.  I can live with the charging time.  Especially since I picked up a spare battery and the charger allows for the hook up of two batteries at one time.<br /><br />Final rating = A","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z96dTBgFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z96dTBgFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Z96dTBgFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AET3KFUXW36VXTRC44MYHYHA6V4A,1574546982978,0,True

I did not expect Holy Stone to replace the whole drone package, free of charge.  I didn't even have to pay shipping.  They delivered me a brand new drone.<br /><br />  On the other hand just note, I would not recommend this drone for beginners,  as it is not easy at all to set up.  You also need to have a smart phone that is on the higher priced side.  A low priced smart phone will not be compatible or be able to support the Holy Stone WiFi link up.<br /><br />  Also with no landing gear, and no propeller guards, i would not recommend this style of drone for beginners.  On the positive side, I very much love the training mode Holy Stone has for this style drone.

895,4.0,My first drone - very exciting,"This is my first drone and I received it as a Christmas gift.  A lot to figure out on operating and flying this thing.  I am a pilot, and have been in aviation for over 40 years, so I am familiar with FAA regulations, and those pertaining to drones.  I am surprised that the instructions only briefly mention the FAA requirement on page 43.  It states that you ""may"" be required to register the drone.  In reality, you are required to register it, and it must be registered before you operate it.  The FAA web site is easy to navigate and it only costs 5.00.  This should be at the very front of the instructions and should be the first thing that you do.  Another item I learned is that the unit compass has to be calibrated every time it is turned on and used.  Couldn't figure out why it wouldn't fly, finally found a statement on page 20 that states ""every time the drone is powered on the compass calibration should be performed""  Well you can take out the word ""should"" and replace it with ""must.""  The unit is fun to operate and works good.  The camera is good, and is adjustable in flight, only wish it had zoom capability.  One thing I have not established is if you always have to have a wifi connection to fly it.  You have to download an app to your phone, and use a wifi connection, which then connects you to the wifi connection created by the drone, which runs off the phone app.  I will need to see if this will fly without a wifi connection, if it wont, then taking it out on hiking adventures wont work.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AERPAWKMHDTV2HWGNZW2ENVRYJ4Q,1577922089177,0,False

904,1.0,Received a Used Item as a Replacement That Works Worse Than the Original!,"I originally purchased this item on July 20, 2020, when I received it, the box had a sticker on it from Amazon saying that the serial number was not in their system, no big deal since the drone looked sealed and unused.  I opened it and after charging the battery for 5 hours started to use it.  The drone flies nicely, although the GPS hold is shaky, in several instances, instead of holding position, the drone would circle the position.  I tried out some of the features that sold me on the drone, when I tried the TapFly feature, it failed to send the waypoints to the drone.  I got a failure every single time regardless of how far the drone was from me at the time.  This is the main reason that I decided to exchange it for a new one.<br /><br />Amazon processed the exchange and I immediately noticed that I was being sent a used item, the item I was replacing was less than 2 weeks old, why wouldn't they replace it with a new item?  I could understand if it was a warranty issue, after the return period expired, then receiving a refurb would be acceptable.  Not on an item that I just purchased that didn't work.  When I received the item last night, sure enough, it was used.  The box wasn't sealed and when I opened it, things were just thrown around everywhere, including the owners manual that was from a Potensic D88 drone, not the Holy Stone HS720 that I purchased.  To make matters worse, the replacement drone must have been returned for a technical issue because the controls stuck at least 3 times in the 10 minute test flight that I took.  I would hold the stick forward, the drone would go forward, but when I released the stick, it should immediately stop, however, it continued forward for about 5 feet after I released it.  This is a safety issue and this drone should've never been cleared by Amazon to go back out.<br /><br />I guess since I cannot receive a new item to replace the new item I purchased, I have no choice but to return the drone for a refund.  I can't even return it and rebuy it because I got it on sale and it is $50 more expensive then I paid.

911,5.0,nice beginner drone package,"[[VIDEOID:bb1a608211180623494a34aeb60c5002]] I was very impressed with the drone package I received from Holy Stone. The packaging was top notch, the carrying case was of great quality. The controller is very nice, the highest quality controller I've seen from Holy Stone. The battery meter and signal meter are awesome to have for a beginner, especially with a drone with this high range and battery life. The drone holds its position fairly well, as you would expect from a gps drone.  I would definitely recommend this drone for a beginner, though I would recommend a wide open space without trees or power lines as with any drone. I like to do most of my outdoor flying at above 100 feet, which this drone ascends to with ease. The camera, while not stabilized, is goood for home videos, pictures of scenery, youtube video, and learning drone photography. This is the first outdoor gps drone I've purchased from Holy Stone, and it is a great outdoor beginner package, it comes with everything you need other than the 2 AA batteries for the controller. But once you charge the battery and get it out, it's surprisingly quiet. Once I get above the tree line, its a fun one to fly around the neighborhood, fairly responsive. The video added to my review is a bit jerky as it was a little windy that day, but  it shows you the sharpness of the camera, and even with the movement has little to no ""jello"". The still shots have great definition, but work best when taking from a downward angle to avoid the propellers in the way.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81oVbvSlNZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81oVbvSlNZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81oVbvSlNZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGFT7ZBQVYM467CJPOT7YXN5O73A,1570818247460,1,True

921,5.0,Probably the best drone I have flown for the money,"[[VIDEOID:97de0255ffb157704afbd5c41484dd68]] 1-6-2020 Update - after about 8 more hours of flying time with this drone I am giving back the one star I deducted for phone holder placement as it just isn't enough to detract from how solid a flyer this drone is.<br /><br />I purchased the HS720 drone during the pre-Christmas sales on Amazon as it looked like a great deal for a Mavic-esq style foldable GPS drone. It had all the basic features I expect in a GPS drone such as one button Return To Home (RTH), lost signal RTH, and low battery RTH. I have about 30 flights under this drone for about 12 hrs of total flight time day and night and I can tell you this thing does not miss a beat. Low wind, medium wind (8-10 mph gusts) and it holds position pretty rock steady. I am definitely impressed. One thing I can tell you is this drone is definitely the N00B friendliest drone I have ever flown, wish it was available when I first started.<br /><br />Breakdown of my thoughts on this drone:<br /><br />Packaging and ease of assembly - excellent packaging in the included case, and literally NO ASSEMBLY it's basically ready to fly out of the box with the following steps:<br /><br />1) Open the box - It comes with Drone, Case, Dual USB-C charger (note it charges one battery at a time), screw driver, spare propellers, USB-C cable.<br /><br />2) Charge the battery and insert 2 AA batteries into the controller<br /><br />3) Download the Ophelia GPS app<br /><br />4) Obtain your FAA recreational drone license (at this time it is $5.00 for a 3 year license) and mark your drone with your FAA number in permanent ink or by permanent sticker.<br /><br />Once the battery is done charging you are ready to launch!<br /><br />Flight and battery time - From experience READ THE MANUAL and always follow the pre-flight steps below BEFORE EVERY flight!<br /><br />1) Pair the drone and controller<br /><br />2) Perform compass calibration<br /><br />3) Perform gyro calibration (both sticks down and left at the same time, see troubleshooting in the manual)<br /><br />4) Get 10+ satellites locked in before launch (takes about 1 min)<br /><br />Launching is simple after following the above steps, hit the unlock button and either left stick up or use one button take off and your flying. I have had this drone up to the factory ceiling of 116m (380 ft) every flight with zero issues except for the FPV. This is believe is 100% due to the placement of the phone holder being above the antenna which in my estimation is the drones ONLY drawback as it seems to interfere with the FPV or the controller. Note that this is not a huge issue since as recreational flyers you fly Line Of Sight unless you have a spotter BUT this is the reason for the drop from 5 to 4 stars. Holy Stone you need to employ a similar setup as other controllers you have with the phone at the bottom.<br /><br />In the Ophelia app you can employ the orbit point of interest function, fly a preset path, or follow me. All work well for a drone at this price point. One button RTH puts the drone either right on my drone pad or with a foot or two of the edge. A word of caution: when the drone hits the first battery warning (slow red flashing of the rear lights) bring her into a location with no obstructions as when the drone hits the second low battery warning you have NO CONTROL and it will hit any obstacles there may be in the way of it's path home. This one is common sense so don't push it.<br /><br />As for flight time I have gotten 23-26 minutes every flight from the 1st to the 30th with no change in flight time, I would however get a second battery now that they are available, plus with the battery you get a nice bag to utilize with them.<br /><br />Camera - the camera works as expected for a drone at this price point, it has nice video/still resolution and full motion up and down.<br /><br />Bottom line this is a great beginner drone that would be hard to lose short of human error and works better than expected at the price!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BrboSrOgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BrboSrOgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BrboSrOgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818VvJATExL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818VvJATExL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818VvJATExL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mz18E2RXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mz18E2RXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mz18E2RXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEQYYCKIFXOK5F72PXIHSFVLO4OA,1578086300064,32,True

It might be OK for a toy for a teenager or a beginner who doesn't care about quality, but the fact is, it's garbage.<br /><br />The propellers are visible in the field of view. Why would one think that's acceptable?<br /><br />It was nearly impossible for the drone to stay connected via the onboard wifi. It made for a potentially dangerous situation when it stopped transmitting and wouldn't reconnect.<br /><br />A good drone for filmmaking (As I learned today) would cost around $1000. If you intend to use a drone for films, pay more and get better quality.

934,5.0,A refined flying experience!,"I bought my HS720 (2K version) directly from Holy Stone but I thought I'd write a review here because I am so excited about this drone!<br /><br />I own an HS110G and a HS120D.  These have been good drones and have been fun to fly.  They are on the cheaper side and, though sturdy, are a bit ""plasticy"".  When I found an amazing deal on the old 720, I decided to make the jump to see what it was all about.<br /><br />Holding this drone in your hand it feels solid.  It's a bit heavy.  It feels like something that's been finely crafted.  The brushless motors sound quite nice as they spin up, the sound of precision.  It is super steady when you bring it up off the ground.  Amazing.<br /><br />Flight time is great at well over 20 minutes.  The remote and WiFi FPV have good range.  So far I have ventured out at 70m up and 200m out with solid connection all around (using an old Samsung Galaxy S5 android phone).  Low battery return to home worked great.  I've been using this drone to get comfortable with flying far out where I can barely see the drone.  So far it's been a great experience!  I like that key telemetry parameters like height, distance, battery levels, are all displayed on the remote!  You don't have to look at the tiny display of these on the FPV app.<br /><br />The drone has 2 speeds and the fast speed is FAST!  You need some wide open space to open it up on the high speed.<br /><br />It is such a pleasant flying experience flying this drone.  I compare flying this drone to driving a Cadillac as compared to my other drones which is more like driving a VW Bug.  Both are really fun, but the 720 is really refined.<br /><br />My only cons are:<br />- With the old 2K version, you have to use the old Ophellia app (Ophellia GPS) as opposed to the Ophellia GO app.  The GO app is a bit more polished and will let you do things like change the units to Imperial rather than metric.  The GPS app does work well.<br />- The gimbal to aim the camera moves WAY too fast and you can't set its position with any precision.<br />- Compared to the latest 720E, the video quality is a bit jumpy.  There isn't any jello, but there is no stability.  The video is more than good enough for FPV which is what I'm really using it for.  If video quality is important to you, consider the 720E.  On the positive side, working to get smooth video with the 720 you will refine your flying technique.<br /><br />Beginners will want to take it a bit slow with this drone at first.  As solid and sturdy as this drone is, I wouldn't want to crash it.  The weight of it will probably break one of the arms.  I crashed my cheaper drones numerous times and they are light so they can take the abuse.  Some of the crashes I had during my first few weeks probably would have broken an arm on this drone.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGWZYN5J2B4XXUQHSXW4GMYHMPHQ,1600116616276,0,False

937,5.0,On Going Review Of The HS720,"UPDATE 3 - I forgot to revisit this review to mention support totally handled the issue. Turns out the behavior is normal for certain runs of this unit. I'm not longer concerned and she continues to fly well!<br /><br />UPDATE 2 - I received my 3rd unit. Same setup steps. I go to unlock the props and the unit revs up 3 times quickly... Very strange... The first 2 units did not do this. I decided to see if it would hover. Which is did for a few moments then it trimmed violently right in my fence. It wasnt high enough to cause any damage but I am questioning support once again what might be happening here. I might just be cursed here. Depending on the outcome, this guy, sorry to save, may be heading back to the warehouse.<br /><br />UPDATE - I am now going through some frustrating times. The first couple of flights were terrific. Super stable. GPS lock clearly working. Terribly easy to fly. 3rd session, not even a few moments into the flight, the thing trims by itself into a tree. I couldnt understand it. I decided to have it replaced via Amazon (Amazon always rocks) and received the new unit today. Set it all up, calibrated precisely per instruction once again, and right out of the gate... its all over the place. There is no wind and the unit is drifting around. Altitude is fluctuating too. Something seems terribly off with this unit too. Currently trying to contact Holy Stone for some ideas. Hopefully we can figure something out because I know the capability is there...<br /><br />This was my first drone purchase and after the first flight I am absolutely hooked into this world. The instructions are crystal clear. Wifi connected with ease, controller too. Before ya know it, she is in the air! I was amazed how stable the unit is. My first flight was in the cramped confines of my backyard but I felt plenty safe despite all the trees. Camera quality is about what I expected which is good but not great like my s10 or actual high end cameras.<br />The included case is a fantastic touch along with the extra accessories.<br /><br />My only complaints are the advertised 5 hour charge times. This might not be the worst if another battery was included. Actually I don't see that extra batteries are in stock which is a bummer.<br /><br />At any rate. Absolutley thrilled!

I have taken up to 400 ft, in my backyard, in at least a 10 mph wind and brought straight down and it will land in a radius of about 3 ft of where it took off.

The first few flights were fine, then for no reason at all, drone took off out of control and crashed. This happened twice and the drone was fully calibrated and had a fully charged battery. The first event resulted with the drone crashing into a large cluster of dense bush so I was able to retrieve it, change out the blades and try again. First flight was fine but the second flight was a disaster as you can see by the posted photos. After liftoff and climbing to about 60 feet, getting stable and just sitting there, the drone went uncontrollable and violently plunged into the ground at full speed. Thank god it didn't hit anyone as there were only a couple of people in the park.

Cari has also followed up on this with me several times. Although quite some time has passed since the original post, this is not due to the support, it's simply due to my location and the time for a shipment to arrive. I have not tested the 720E yet but I will soon and will follow-up with a review of it.

Please consider my comments as an on experienced person<br />If this is your first drone you may want to reconsider. I would say this would be for amid level experience person to operate not a beginner or first time person. Certainly not a child’s toy.<br />The drone itself is well built, quiet, and will do what you want once you figure it out. Light wind is no issue just wind gust can be a problem but can be for any type drone or craft of this nature.<br />The part we struggled with greatly was getting it to fly. There is a start up procedure that requires you to go through a start up process to calibrate. Took us 8 times before we could get it to function and then it was unexpected when we set it down in my living room. Not sure who loves quicker my wife or the dogs.<br />After several frustrating days and several people we figured out Hover Mode and was able to get some really good video and pics<br />I put it away then when I took it out for a project I could not get it to fly again. I assume you must calibrate each time which is really frustrating.<br />I have attempted to use it on 3 projects and twice I could not get it to even come on.<br />With that said I don’t think it is a drone issue.<br />You must download an app and sinc it with the drone and controller. Very difficult to do.<br />If you have a large phone the holder on the controller will not accommodate it. This itself makes proper operation very difficult.<br />Getting it to fly in manual control has not been something we have figured out.<br />But... when we have lucked up and got everything to work it’s not too bad and takes great pics.<br />Again I am new I am sure it’s my lack of experience but we shall see as I have asked someone who flew military scout drones to give me a hand.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHWVQ5UEBOGTRINZZ4WAONTI6HIQ,1572024190591,0,True

Very easy setup. Instructions are clear to follow for setup. Very responsive to flight commands, and some of the fly aways I’ve heard about, I haven’t experienced that. Just make sure you calibrate the drone each time before flight. Add that at the top of your pre-flight check list. The camera takes very good and smooth video with awesome detail as well! I would highly recommend this drone and any other that Holy Stone puts out. You won’t be disappointed! And did I mention customer service?

970,5.0,So far I'm enjoying it!,It's easy enough to fly. Very good battery life. It's a smaller size so if it's windy it's going to be noticeable. I just want to say that take your time before lifting off. Make sure you calibrate it and wait to see that the satellites show up on your phone screen. I think that on one occasion when flying it decided to start flying off but I just took control and brought it back. I think after the calibration that I just didn't wait at all and started flying. I since made sure I took time and also checked for numerous satellite signals to be connected and never a issue since. Only other thing is the camera has saturated color and kind of fisheye type pictures that makes the top side look rounded.

971,5.0,A Fantastic Business Tool,"I spent a great deal of time researching drones with integrated cameras for my wife who is a businesswoman and not a hobbyist. Aerial photographs are useful in her marketing work, but because she didn't want to invest a lot of time in learning to operate a drone or invest a great deal of money, she's been contracting that work out to others. Unfortunately, the results are not always what she's looking for.<br /><br />After reading the reviews of the Holy Stone HS720, I felt it was inexpensive enough to take a gamble. I'm really glad I did. My wife was reluctant to fly it because her only experience with drones was with the simple toy units. The first step was to read the instructions and cautions carefully, which were few and easy to understand. Next we watched a couple of 15 minute videos. We were both surprised that she was able to operate the drone as easily as the videos portrayed. By the time she exhausted the battery (over 20 minutes), she seemed like a pro to me and after looking at the pictures she produced, she felt like it too.<br /><br />The only thing missing was a couple of extra batteries. One of the main reasons I chose the HS720 was the comparatively long life of the battery versus other units in this price range. I believe they advertised 26 minutes of flying time and I know we got very close to that. That's probably enough when you have your project planned out and have more experience under your belt, but while you're learning both flying and taking pictures, it would be nice to have an extra battery or two. When I ordered the unit, extra batteries were not yet available, so I hope they'll be shipping soon.<br /><br />While I'm sure there are a lot of fun and recreational uses for this drone, I know there are many business people that would benefit greatly from it. We'll be talking this up to friends and associates all through the Christmas season.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGY7DRIQBR3OKKC7RTV7SYYXMY4A,1575164296321,0,False

I were very upset for what's happening and very frustrated about this drone so I call amazon customer service to explain to them what's happened, they were very nice and tell me should be contact to the manufacture of the drone and tell them that was the drone malfunction by itself. I call Holly stone customer service to explain to them what's happened, after they listened to me and they start to investigate by asking me few questions and tell me tomorrow to call them back for the result. Afternoon the day later I called them and they gave me the answer right away that they will replace another one for me.

The Hs720 is such a Joy to fly and do photos with. I took it up to 134.5 ft and let go of the controls and it was like I had sit it on a shelf to take pictures.  I searched and did my homework to find something that did not break my bank and I am not disappointed at all. I highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for something to get into. I recieved it in the mail a day before it was supposed to arrive.  On Aug 27, 2020 and since it is my new best friend. I reccomend the app B4UFLY to help keep you out of no fly zones and it was very simple to register with the FAA due to the weight. 5 bucks and 2 mins and well I was ready to go. I am Thankful for the amount of info that is available on this Quadcopter.

1016,5.0,"Be careful, have fun!","[[VIDEOID:a03c1c2e13606a30a2fb8c110d815b1a]] This is a fun drone to fly and I think the only thing you have to really worry about is take offs and landings. The blades are not guarded so if you get close enough those blades can cut you so be careful!<br />The compact design on the body and the ability to fold the arms make it perfect for fitting into a backpack or even a handbag. Because the case and everything that goes with it is about the size of a book you can really take it anywhere.<br />In order for the camera to shoot in higher resolution you must have a class 10 memory card. You can still shoot and save to your phone in lower resolution, but might as well pick up a memory card to unlock it for potential.<br />Make sure to download the app to unlock all of the drone features otherwise you can still fly the drone but will not have access to the camera. Downloading the app lets you open up the camera features and you can see everything through your iPhone which makes flying it really cool!<br />Make sure you give yourself plenty of takeoff and landing space because you don’t want anybody near when doing either. The return home feature for the drone is amazing. This lets you bring the drone back to where it took off with the push of a button. The stabilizing feature for this camera feels like springs or shock absorbers. My next Drone will definitely have a gimbal on it but this is a great drone to learn on, and it’s still has some really good features.<br />Honestly, I’ve crashed this one a couple of times because of wind gusts, so try to and fly on a calm day. As soon as you get it above your head and out and away from you and others, it’s a lot easier to navigate but definitely make sure the wind gusts dies down before you land it, be careful and have fun!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1Foro5mkZS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1Foro5mkZS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1Foro5mkZS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1ApHvY+JVS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1ApHvY+JVS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1ApHvY+JVS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1b4IJr3gAS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1b4IJr3gAS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1b4IJr3gAS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHQKO3PNSAC3DTIDRCEBDOO3JDOA,1617050189157,1,True

1037,5.0,Great drone for a first timer,"This was my first drone purchase, so I have nothing to compare it to.  Did a bit of research, looking for something in the $300 range, and this one appeared to be fairly new on the market, within my preferred price range, and seemed to have excellent reviews.  In fact, Holy Stone drones seem to be very well liked among more experienced drone owners.  For a beginner, the instructions are somewhat vague about some of the functions, and there are so many to remember.  However, after one trip to the local Best Buy to purchase a TF Memory card, I then managed to figure out how the battery charger worked, and after a lengthy start-up procedure, was able to get this thing off the ground.  I especially like the auto take-off and land feature, and if you get confused, just take your hands off of the controls and it hovers in place while you get it together.  Like I said before, I have nothing to compare this drone to, but I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for one.  I would not recommend this as a toy for young children though.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGGLJ6EF5TF2F3Y4DMSO4SPOR6IA,1570643469515,1,True
1038,1.0,Disappointing…,"I had been practicing at a local park nearby cars, houses, and buildings, and everything was fine. I went to our farm which is completely open sky, and went to take my skills to flight and literally this drone fell hard for at least 200 feet high. Thank God it wasn’t above my car, house, barn, or anything else, I was being careful and was above grass. It landed in about 3 feet of grass which certainly cushion its fall but still every single blade broke off of the drone. I had 15 satellite points, good reception on my phone of the flight, and I can’t tell you anything more than it just fell out of the sky unannounced. Everything was going great and then all the sudden I heard a weird noise which I believe was the propeller stopping, and it just free fell from such a great height. I hoped it would be salvageable as I just bought it two weeks ago, but it was total. I really hope holy stone well be receptive of this product failure as I was having a great time with the drone before this catastrophic failure. But as of right now I am a completely dissatisfied customer.<br /><br />———<br /><br />11/7/22 UPDATE:<br /><br />I have been sent replacement drone and it would seem that the replacement is operating more controlled than the first. I am weary of flying over houses and vehicles etc, but in open spaces so far so good with replacement. Will update in a few weeks.<br />————-<br /><br />NOV 22 UPDATE: after testing the 3rd replacement drone in an open field for days, I took it out to a real estate property of mine to do what I ordered it for- take pictures and video of the properties for advertising purposes. I calibrated it directly before flight. Took off, had good signal, and at about 150 feet I lost total control. Very low wind. It flew behind me in an uncontrolled manner until it lost signal. No idea where it is. Worst is I am in a residential area so I don’t know if it landed on someone’s car or house…<br /><br />After 3 drones lost I am done with Holy Stone. I guess there’s a reason DJI is so much more expensive… very let down and disappointed.<br /><br />***customer service has BEEN GREAT, unfortunately they’re working for a (in my case) 3x defunct product***","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714G1mE4j+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714G1mE4j+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714G1mE4j+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEQCLKJFJWW2IKQF7PJSYVHVY75A,1665185356448,15,True
1039,5.0,Excellent drone/camera for the money and easy to learn.,"I tried a less expensive drone initially but was not satisfied with the short flight time.  After further research, I purchased the Holy Stone HS720.  WOW.  Great flight time.  Easy to learn and maneuver.  After sitting down with the drone outside, and going through the sync, calibrate, and start-up procedure several times, I was up and running, taking pictures of our horses, the house and ponds, and other items.  I lost communication with the drone on the second flight (I may have exceeded the connection distance), and the drone returned as advertised.

1049,5.0,Very good drone at a reasonable price,"[[VIDEOID:c307a9762b501588fa71ed4569050db2]] The other drone that I considered instead of this one was a Mavic Mini.  The main deciding point for me was price, and the fact that I was just learning how to use a drone.  That said, this HS720 is a very good drone.  As you can see from the pictures, the camera is very high quality, especially for still pictures.  Two of the three pictures were taken from more than 300 feet up, and the quality is very high.  The HS720 has a very good battery life, a little more than 20 minutes with heavy camera use, maybe 25 is you are just flying around for fun.  It is very easy to fly right away, and the remote control is very informative and easy to use.  The app is very intuitive, and works well.<br /> (Make sure you download Ophelia GO, not Ophelia GPS.  the GPS will not work with this drone.)  It is well-built, and has already survived two direct-hit crashes into trees, one of them at fairly high speed.  (This also points out the other feature I wish it had: collision avoidance.  But for the price, you won't get that anywhere.)  All I had to do was dust it off, and it was ready to go again.  The video, if you watch it, shows you several things about the drone.  First, the positives:  It has good color balance and resolution (the resolution is actually much better than what is shown here, it was downgraded drastically to email it), and the auto-takeoff and auto-landing at about the midpoint of the video work great.  It also shows the only real drawback of this drone vs. the Mavic Mini: the camera has no gimbal stabilization, so the video can be very shaky at times.  This was my very first flight, and I have since learned to reduce the shaking with a more gentle and gradual change of speed and direction, but some of that shakiness will always be there.  This is the one clear advantage the Mini has.  If a rock-steady video is not essential, this drone if a good choice.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Good price<br />-Great still pictures<br />-High resolution (4K) video<br />-Great battery life<br />-Good performance<br />-Full-featured and informative remote<br />-Includes a nice carrying case<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Shaky video at times<br />-No collision avoidance (but to get this, you will have to spend quite a bit more money)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71td2J7hRsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71td2J7hRsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71td2J7hRsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LBcpxi88L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LBcpxi88L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LBcpxi88L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gMG2zySUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gMG2zySUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gMG2zySUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHLCERYCWDSEPH4HWKQ5CYTE3WBA,1594070717007,0,True

1066,5.0,First Drone-Lot Of Research,"I spend a relatively absurd amount of time researching product specs, reviews & expectations prior to purchase. I'd been considering the purchase of a drone for, roughly, 2 years. I did not want to spend a fortune (DJI) or purchase a ""toy.""<br /><br />The HS720, based on reviews, range, camera features, portability, company (Holy Stone well regarded in the drone hobbyist community) & value fit the bill.<br /><br />Although I've never flown a drone before, this thing could not be easier to fly. I did watch a couple of YouTube videos prior to taking flight. I was blown away by the drone's ability to hover, without any change in direction, indefinitely. It's worth mentioning, the drone was able to accomplish this in 15 mile per hour winds. The drone's responsiveness to transmitter commands is instantaneous & precise. Anyone could fly this thing, without worry of destroying it or losing it, right out of the box. It took no more than two minutes before I felt 100% comfortable with the drone's handling. I had it at 120 meters in altitude & out 200 meters within five minutes, in a heavily wooded area (Very tall oak trees), and felt perfectly confident that the drone was coming home safely.<br /><br />Although easy to fly, the drone's responsiveness & agility makes it incredibly exciting to fly!<br /><br />On my second flight, I took some high altitude photo & video. If this is your first drone & you don't need ""professional photography"" quality image, the HS720 won't disappoint. Anyone making mention of ""poor image quality"" isn't using an SD card & is relying upon wifi beaming images back to their mobile device. The drone has a built in SD card slot. That's what it's for.  Use it. Absolutely no reason to complain if you're not taking advantage of this built in and, frankly, necessary feature. The image quality is phenomenal. Period. Not fair to compare it to an exponentially more expensive drone or high end standalone camera. The camera is great. It will not disappoint.<br /><br />The live first person view was far better than expected. Image quality, even while streaming at over 200 meters out, is wonderful. No signal issues. Crystal clear. I would have been absolutely comfortable flying, without ever looking at the drone itself (Line of sight), while relying entirely on my phone's first person view.<br /><br />I LOVE the portability. The case everything comes in is GREAT. Most reviews don't mention this. I could not believe how compact it is. EVERYTHING fits in the hard case perfectly & the case takes up, maybe, 1/4 the space of an average sized backpack.

I got a flight time of over 24 minutes which is great.  GPS and optical sensors make this drone a very stable flyer that holds its position well.  All of the extra functions, like follow me, preset path flight, orbit, return home work well.  It is a very quick and responsive flier.  Especially in 2nd speed it really moves!  Video is crisp and clear and photo are very sharp.  The ability to adjust camera up or down from remote is nice.  The video is reasonably smooth for a non-stabilized camera.  That is my biggest issue with this drone is that the only stabilization is the ""shock absorption"" dampering system built in.  There is no gimbal or EIS.  The battery setup is also a bit of a pain but still ok.<br />Overall, this is a very great flying drone and a pretty decent photo drone.  Video is clear but not as smooth as I'd like, but maybe I'm being too picky.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21NA98C9nsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21NA98C9nsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21NA98C9nsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8124KafOyPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8124KafOyPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8124KafOyPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CnPdbOJHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CnPdbOJHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CnPdbOJHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFSMMMA57NTIEJWYPJNQHP22RLZQ,1568777477504,2,True

After learning to fly it, I upgraded to the HS720 4K Foldable quadcopter. The transition was pretty seamless due to the similarity in controls. I took the HS720 to the beach to get some good aerial video and photos, but was a little apprehensive due to the weather. The wind finally died down, the rain cleared, and after practicing indoors a little more on the HS160, I launched the HS720. What a great experience! It was surprisingly quick and responsive. After a little experimentation I began flying it over the beach to take video. I returned home the next day and flew it over the nearby golf course, taking more video and still photos. So far, I’ve used the auto homing and orbiting features, but haven’t yet tried the follow-me or map routing options. I’m really enjoying the HS720 4K Foldable. So far I’ve only had one scare. Although it was still in sight, video connection to the drone disconnected and I couldn’t see where it was going on the display. After a few minutes I maneuvered it back within range and was able to use the auto home feature to bring it back to me. I’m looking forward to flying this UAS a lot more, and to take more videos and photos.

1106,5.0,Fantastic Drone Great Value,"This drone is extremely well made and well documented.  The company supports this product extremely well.  I completely recommend this product!  It has features that make flight and landings very easy to manage, and the camera images are fabulous.  Here are a few additional thoughts:<br /><br />* Charge the batteries overnight before anything else.  Remove the foam collar from the batteries prior to use in the drone (they won't fit otherwise).<br />* Carefully pair the drone to the controller.<br />* You may want to fly the drone first, prior to setting up the APP.  This will give you a feel for its flying features.  Don't overdue your first flights.<br />* Load the APP on your cell phone -- and be SURE to use the CR code that is printed in the Quick Start guide.  I used the wrong CR code at first (from the internet user manual) and got the wrong APP.<br />* Carefully set up the connection between your cell phone and the drone.  This involves establishing a  WiFi connection from the drone to your cell phone -- and be patient as the two devices find each other.<br />* Go through the ""beginner stuff"" that is displayed by the APP.<br />* Carefully test the drone in a safe location using the controller while looking at the APP (see the next step below before proceeding), getting used to the up/down, rotate, left/right, back/forward, fast/slow and takeoff/landing features monitored via the video.  The features are great, but use them a lot early on before doing any substantial wandering with the drone.<br />* Change the default settings in the parameters when using the APP.  The default settings keep the drone very close nearby, and until you figure this out you may think the drone is not working right.<br />* If you are going to explore a larger location, I recommend if possible standing in the middle of the location to be explored.  Managing a drone 300 feet away is difficult, not because of the drone but because your depth perception does not work well at that distance.  Managing a drone solely by the video feed can be done, but much practice is needed before proficiency is achieved.<br />* Enjoy!

1113,1.0,Be careful...... I WAS in love wtih this drone!,"[[VIDEOID:ec27840fa6b2fd847a1c702036757aeb]] Updated review.... I was hearing stories about this drone dropping WIFI and darting off. Over the last 2 months, this has happened to me multiple times. I fly this right by my house, in fact, the last time it dropped I was in my backyard (see pics)........ I was on my back patio, taking pictures of my remodeled backyard/pool. I completed the standard start up, got air-born, took my first pic and the drone dropped WIFI, darted off hitting my neighbors fence, 3 blocks away EXPLODING (see pic). This was not the first experience of this happening. I was in my front yard and multiple times it dropped WIFI and darted off on me. Fortunately those times it hit tress/bushes and only needed a few propeller replacements. Does HOLY STONE have a recycle credit LOL.... I want to buy it again but not for $300.00 and risk it ""exploding"" on me again.<br /><br />Great bang for your buck. I have had a few issues connecting but after some resilience I was able to make it happen. This drone takes great photos/videos especially for the price. Durable, I flew it into a few trees OOOPS lol, no issue after.  Used it on the beach and out by my house , in the country. 10 MPH winds it was very stable. I can’t say enough but it.

I have crashed my drone a few times and it held up well. After watching videos an 3axle gimbal cameras, I realize that this drones major downfall is unusable video quality. I have made decent screenshots from the videos I made which works well for me. I wish Holy Stone would improve the drone wifi signal because it loses connection pretty quick. I usually hit record and hopefully get decent shots since I’m unable to watch in duration. This drone is a good starter to see if this hobby is for you but after flying it, you will definitely be looking for something better.

1151,5.0,"Great Capabilities for developing skills, not foolproof though","I love the capabilities and features of this drone for how affordable it is. It was my first real drone with decent video and my first GPS capable drone. It has been great for learning and experimenting but has advanced enough features to allow me to do more than just play around with it. The main drawback for me is the time it takes to charge, however the flight time is good. Replacement parts if you need them are easy enough to come back and with a little attention to detail can easily be successfully installed. I do wish the phone holder on the remote for the one I have was a little sturdier, and as you get more advanced there becomes some things to be desired from the drone. The case is excellent and makes taking what I need to fly with me really convenient and protected. I have had this since September of 2020 and continue to fly it, at times my 6 year old flys it, she is a very responsible and fast learning 6 year old but she loves it and despite severe anxiety at first I now tend not to worry if she wants to fly as long as there is not a high wind. In the cases of higher winds aloft you need to be careful because at lower levels it may be fine but as the wind encounters less ground resistance it can lessen the stability of the drone and cause it to struggle with mobility, but it is nice not to have to have perfectly calm conditions to fly, otherwise with the area I live in you would only fly 9 days a year. The things I wasn't prepared for was how susceptible it is to the wind and the fact that large metal objects that produce any kind of magnetic field can affect the calibration leading to the drone ""running away"".","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-t-W1QgiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-t-W1QgiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-t-W1QgiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OWtiFvV9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OWtiFvV9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OWtiFvV9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7109LRyB9OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7109LRyB9OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7109LRyB9OL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sUjfI8mxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sUjfI8mxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sUjfI8mxL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGZLS7F6PR4YEJWILWV2MXEQRVLA,1643050544033,0,True

1168,3.0,HS720 vs DJI Mavic mini,"1st off I have to say I'm not a pro at drones or leaving reviews. I love to read reviews but don't care to ever leave one... I'm only leaving one because I wish I would have went a different way from the get.<br /><br />Great drone but for the $$, the dji mini is $400 and is far superior for just 100 bucks more then the 720.<br />I received the 720 drone for Christmas 2019. I loved it at first but I didnt like a few things about it. After more reviews of other drones I ordered a Mavic mini.<br />Partial comparison of the 2:<br />The 720s camera does not correct itself when you fly forward or stop which means when you focus on something moving when your drone is stationary and then press forward, you camera dips down along with the angle of your drone. The dji mavic mini's cam corrects itself for smooth video that doesn't lose the subject. The 720 loses signal to the phone by just going 100yards or so while the dji mini took me almost 2 miles away in town without losing signal to my phone. The 720 camera control is not smooth. It has one speed to adjust up or down. The mavic mini can smoothly adjust up or down at the speed you want. The 720 has follow mode while the mavic min does not. The HS720 has 1080p vid while the mavic mini is 720. The 720 battery takes 7hours to charge with an awesome 26min fly time. The mavic mini battery takes around 2hours to fully charge with a 20min fly time (sport mode).<br /><br />The HS720 is a $300 drone that feels like a value of around $250-$300.<br />The mavic min is a $400 drone that feels like your getting a value of $600-$700.<br />I'm just a Christmas newb so if my review helps you then good, if not then leave it.

1186,3.0,The good and bad,"Just got this about 2 weeks ago. Fun, decent drone as my first. However, it is super sensitive to the controls so I accidentally hit a wall and broke one of the arms. I've not been able to find the replacement arm as their customer support says they supply them through Amazon but Amazon says there's non in stock even though there is... I purchased 2 extra batteries and now don't have a working drone which is upsetting. The video is not stable so not sure if this can be fixed with software after the fact. Moral of the story is decent drone but be aware that it's not the most stable machine and is easy to crash. Don't look for a quick replacement on parts either if you do break it (btw you'll have to work with several tiny wires if you break an arm)",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGU52VYWR4F6VOHKQENBT2QDL3PQ,1596299780581,0,True

There is a major flaw in the ""return home feature"" which brings the drone back to the last place it took off from. You can toggle this feature if you choose to BUT the feature will turn on automatically if the battery gets too low. Once the feature turns on due to low battery the drone goes on autopilot and THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF. Multiple times the drone has kamikazed straight into a  tree and sometimes the drone does not land from where it took off and it tries to go land in a different part of town.

1193,5.0,Love this Little Drone,"This was the second drone I ordered by Holy Stone through Amazon.  The first, model 700E, proved to be too bulky and not as portable as this model.  It also came with an inoperable camera, which is the reason I returned it for this one instead, model 700, and I'm glad I did.  Everything between the 2 models is exactly the same except for 3 aspects; 1) model 700 is foldable, while 700E is not.  2) model 700E has a 2 gimbal axis camera to assist in image stabilization while the 700 model does not.  But, I find the sharpness and clarity of the images I've received from the model 700 to be excellent.  The only noticeable blur occurs when you make a sudden stop or start while in flight, and that blurring is only slight and lasts a split second.  3). the batteries charge using a dedicated Holy Stone charger on the 700 model, while the 700E only requires a mini USB.<br /> So, overall, for a significantly lower price point, I am very happy with the model 700.  It is fun, accurate and truly worth its price.  Super easy learning how to operate, too.  Plus, I had the opportunity to call Holy Stone's customer service which I must say is an outlier in a good way.  Not only did customer service try to help me with the problem I was having with the model 700E's camera, they called me back on 2 occasions after I switched out the 2 drones to see if everything was alright with the new drone.

1212,5.0,Great bang for buck,"So let's start with an accurate review. Please read all. Start with cons then pros.<br />Dissatisfaction on the fact that your remote will reach a great distance however when using the Ophelia App for the drone you are limited to certain height and distance restrictions. The drone is also only wifi connected on the phone so the FPV lags and or cuts out after you fly so far away. Also noticed the picture or video on phone lags when near other buildings or sometimes when I was flying over the pool or ocean. I believe this to be due to the electromagnetic fields from the ocean at a low altitude and the pool as it has lighting.<br /><br />Now on to the PROS. Well there's alot.though the photo age in the videos did lag at times I hot amazing photos and videos once high enough or far enough from any electromagnetic fields. Though the phone app goes by wifi the remote signal is quite strong for the drone receiver and you can fly it by line of sight with no issue. For myself as not a beginner and not a pro this is the best drone for the money. 2.7k and 4k video and photos. I was just at our place in the Florida keys and added some pictures. We have 15 to 20 mph winds and to my surprise it fly against the wind. Now I will say for how compact this thing is it packs a punch. It struggled at 20mph and wouldn't recommend as it was difficult to keep a steady video. Anything 15mph and below worked fine for taking smooth shoots and getting great footage. I have already recommended this to 3 of my friends and would do the same for you. Its hard not to have fun. Get a few extra batteries. Though they last 26-32 minutes depending on wind and distance/height, they do take awhile to charge.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710KrxUNxGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710KrxUNxGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710KrxUNxGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FZdBusneL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FZdBusneL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FZdBusneL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vck4Fz9CL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vck4Fz9CL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vck4Fz9CL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZPUVSuLyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZPUVSuLyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZPUVSuLyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cBFP9goNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cBFP9goNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cBFP9goNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71llPgMsm3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71llPgMsm3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71llPgMsm3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sVHZYKhBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sVHZYKhBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sVHZYKhBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGY3TA5R46KO7K4FYXRYKPIBPTYQ,1602507074834,4,True

In July I purchased a Holy Stone model HS100 drone and was very pleased with the stability and easy of flying of this model.  This drone was much easier to control than any of the drones I had previously purchased.  My only issue with this model was a wifi connectivity problem and this may have been partially due to the older model cell phone I am using.  Because I had such a great experience with the HS100, I recently purchased a Holy Stone HS720.  This drone had several improvements over the HS100 including higher resolution camera, longer flight time, brushless motors, and 5GHz wifi connectivity.  The main feature that I liked about the HS720 was the travel-friendly design.  The HS720 folds into a very small size that makes it much easier to carry.  Although I have not had the HS720 for a long period of time, I am very impressed with the flying ease and stability of this drone.  Flying time on a battery charge is great too.  The higher resolution videos are also a big improvement over those of the HS100.  In addition, I have not had any wifi connectivity issues so far.  I am also very pleased with Holy Stone customer support.  They have been very responsive and helpful in helping me deal with my previous wifi connectivity problems.  In summarizing, I would highly recommend the HS720 to anyone who is interested in flying drones.  I am getting hooked.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aJrpOZpHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aJrpOZpHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aJrpOZpHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFCCLDL7PNSQKWGZCDZS5UTGCBFQ,1569073457121,1,False

I could tell it was receiving input, but not enough to counter whatever the flight controller was trying to do. Tried with and without GPS, all the same.<br /><br />I had one magical 2 minute flight after my 4th calibration that I thought had fixed the issues, but then Nope, off it went.

Minor dents in a couple propeller after dive bombing a boulder 15ft away from where it should have been hovering in addition to the half dozen trips into some bushes...

This drone for approximately $300 is well worth it because of its fly time is right at 25+ minutes and it comes with remote controller and a nice case! The drone fly's very nice and is quite stable in the wind. I don't recommend flying any drone in the wind for obvious reasons. The controls are accurate and easily accessed but 1 con that I have is the buttons on the front are hard t get to when my phone is attached on the remote there's no room for my fat fingers to easily get to them. The customer service @ HolyStone is exceptional and very helpful and if your looking for a professional drone at a reasonable price that's equipped with gps and a good camera along with all you need to fly it plus spare parts and a nice case this is the one you want.

The instructions are clear and logical.  I had a slight mishap (my own doing, it seems) on my maiden flight, and the customer service agent, Kim, was extremely helpful.  He got me flying again in no time.<br /><br />The battery powers a flight time of 26 minutes which is adequate, and it comes with a spare battery, which is even better.  Some good thinking went into the charger as well.  It automatically charges two batteries (one after the other) on one session, eliminating the need for me to interrupt whatever I'm doing (or sleeping) to switch batteries in the charger.  I'm ready for almost a full hour of flying time on my next session.<br /><br />Pay attention to the GPS signal if you fly on low battery or a long distance from the control module.  Don't count on the drone to return to home with a weak GPS signal.  That's about the only thing to be extra careful about.  Otherwise, it practically flies itself.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGD3ILHJFQ6YRU7ECR76Y7ECXUOA,1626376805137,0,True

1264,1.0,"Poor hovering, cheap remote, need to register with FAA","3-2-22 update: Holy Stone reached out to me and asked if they could offer a replacement for me to test and update my review. Very nice gesture, except they sent me a drone that had been destroyed and returned. 3 of the prop legs were completely broken,  and it there was dried mud on the drone. It looks like it was run over by a lawn mower. See the photos. Epic fail HS.<br /><br />This drone is much heavier than I expected for its size and didn't realize it required FAA registration for this reason. I immediately noticed upon takeoff that it had difficulty hovering in place, as it swayed back and forth and was difficult to stabilize. Once flying it was not very responsive and there was a noticeable delay between the transmitter and the drone. I returned this drone and went with a DJI Mavic Mini for about $100 more on Prime Day. I do not regret my decision. Also, Holy Stone contacts anyone who rates their product less than 4 stars with an attempt to make it right, which is great, but they also try to get you to change your score no matter what. So the average reviews you read are inflated. Take notice of this when making your decision.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A8qreW24L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A8qreW24L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A8qreW24L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WA0bLIa5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WA0bLIa5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WA0bLIa5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kCqYhx-6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kCqYhx-6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kCqYhx-6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFVVYSPJDE65XFH56G273VM2VSDQ,1628016107133,1,False

1266,5.0,"Great until it disappeared. -- Updated, Great Seller","Went flying with it out in the park last night, which started out great. The 1 button lift off worked as expected, the drone itself handles very well and pretty much hovered in place completely even with some light breeze. Follow me mode worked pretty well, a bit sluggish but it did follow me as I circled the park. and the POI also works as advertised. As I got more confident with it I flew a bit higher and further away from me to test out the return home function. which didn't do it's job at all, pushing the button saw the drone flying up which I thought was normal since videos I saw on youtube mentioned it suppose to get to a certain height before coming back. Unfortunately it didn't really come back down to where I initially homed it. as it reached the designated height, it shot to the right into the treelines. I frantically tried get control of it to bring it back but was not able to. the last I saw of it was it going into the trees. I tried to recover it last night and this morning, but was unable to... I suspect it got stuck on one of the tree somewhere ... such a disappointment... what ever you do, do not use the recall button ... they should label it as fly away button.<br /><br />Update - To my surprise, the seller after learning my situation, sent me an replacement.

1279,5.0,Holy stone stands behind its product! Great Drone,"Easy drone to learn and train on.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />GPS tech allows the drone to stay stationary even in high winds.<br />Something often over looked is a high quality instruction manual in color and with easy to understand pictures.<br />The gimble  is quick and responsive.<br />The battery life is exceptional for the class of drone.<br />The drone comes with a nice carrying case and charger that can charge two batteries simultaneously.<br />The color saturation of the camera is very impressive.<br />The best part is world class customer service. I ran my drone into a tree in Colorado and broke two of the swing arms off. Holy stone responded immediately to my emails and promptly sent replacements.<br />I can say with experience the drone is very easy to disassemble and repair if that ever happens to you.<br />The drone is very quite and is very smooth in its movements.<br />I like that it is will lit and has a light that can be turned on and off by the operator. Very handy for night flights<br /><br />Cons<br />The range of the camera using a phones WiFi is much more limited Than the remote. A big improvement would be for the camera to communicate through the remote and the phone directly attaches to the remote. Max distance for the phone unobstructed is about 600 feet. (iPhone 11 pro) That was tested in a suburban area near hundreds of WiFi sources. Still that is a range that significantly effects the use of the drone.<br /><br />The other issue is the stabilization of the camera gimble. It doesn’t track a target and doesn’t stabilize the camera  when the drone is moving which makes for choppy videos. While the drone is changing its motion and losing your subject while flying<br /><br />I really wish you didn’t have to recalibrate the compass and GPS every time you changed a battery.<br /><br />I own about 25 drones. I have experience with many GPS drones including the DJI line up. If you are on budget and really enjoy photography this drone is for you.

1285,5.0,Customer service is fantastic and the drones are very stable in flight,"Up to the time my boys and I have only flown toy-grade drones. I decided to order two HS720 drones for my boys for Christmas. We had to wait a few days to fly because because in Washington we get a lot of rain and fog during the winter.<br /><br />My first boy fired up his drone, performed the GPS calibration, add hit the button to level up to about 5 feet of the ground.  He then proceeded to fly the drone over the backyard, above the house and over the greenspace behind our house.  My son hit the return to home button and the drone rose up in the air about 50 feet, flew back over our heads and proceeded to land about three feet away from where it took off.  I also took the drone for a quick spin and everything flew perfectly.  We were super impressed with how great the drone flew.<br /><br />After that it was my other son's turn.  Again he calibrated the GPS and hit the hover button.  The drone hovered about five feet in the air and he took the drone for it's maiden flight.  After flying the drone over the green space my son hit the return to home button and the drone started flying around in circles and flew into the side of a hill on the other side of our house.<br /><br />My son was crushed but Holy Stone customer service was fantastic.  I was afraid that they would say that their warranty does not cover crashes but they were very polite, asked a lot of questions, and then informed us that they would send us a new drone and we could keep the old one for parts.<br /><br />We were of course super excited and can't wait to get the new drone.  We are also thinking about dabbling in FPV, so if anyone knows of goggles that work well with the HS720, please let us know.<br /><br />One thing to note.  With the exception of the return to home issue with the second drone, both drones flew extremely well and were very stable in the air.  When you let go of the controls they simply hover and let you think about what you want to do next in terms of flight control.  This is perfect for beginners.  I would recommend this drone to any beginner because they are easy to fly and because the Holy Stone customer service is fantastic and stands behind their product.  I expect many other companies might try to hide and say it was the customer's fault, but Holy Stone is a stand-up company that you can rely on.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFFPO2D4NLMGMVS5XTZ5LYCPWRMQ,1577996038353,0,True

1292,5.0,I continue to be impressed...,"After a friend introduced me to a professional drone several years ago while capturing video of my vineyard, I thought I would need to spend over 1k for something that would come close to the quality of video that he was able to produce. After about three months of research and watching a variety of YouTube videos on drones, and seeing the ""loss leader"" drones advertised on Facebook, I was fascinated by what potentially could be purchased for a reasonable price. I also realized that I wouldn't be happy if I spent under $100 - so what to do... I took a chance and bought this drone for under $300... WOW - still impressed and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />After buying this drone last year, I've have not had a lot of hours of flight time yet, but WOW, my expectations for the quality of this drone for the price has FAR exceeded my expectations. This review is from someone who has never owned a drone before and never flown one either... I have flown RC aircraft and I do consider myself a hobbyist with other products - so take this review for what it's worth... also, I logged on today to buy a couple of extra batteries and some propeller props - for the time when I need to replace...<br /><br />Ease of first use - The software for my android phone installed without any problem and the instructions were very clear on how to initialize the drone and get it into the air. Total thumbs up!<br /><br />Quality of product - The quality of construction, compact size, case, packaging etc. exceeded my expectations and reflects a high quality product. For the price, you would be surprised... and from all appearances, it seems less flimsy than other models out there for sale.<br /><br />Quality of video - WOW - the camera works great, the high definition and quality of the video is professional quality including the built in gimble that offers stability during flight.<br /><br />Quality of motors - WOW - I'm amazed at how quiet this is in flight. The brushless motors are extremely quiet and efficient.<br /><br />Battery time in flight - WOW - I've been up for more than 20 minutes and it still wants to keep on flying. I have yet to exceed my range from the ground and the responsiveness in a light breeze is still amazingly good.<br /><br />At the end of the day, if you're looking for a good intro drone that delivers on all of the expert features for an intro price, you WON'T be disappointed with this product!<br /><br />One final update - sadly I just crashed it into a hard object - WALL of my house.

1293,3.0,Broke on third flight,"For context... please note that I have over a dozen drones and have been flying these things for over a decade. I've had great luck with a wide range of brands. There are some good things to say about this product. It flies smoothly and hovers in a small space (when working properly). As for the cons, it constantly resets and required us to recalibrate even during a single use. It loses range on the app for me on a brand new iPhone 11 after reaching about 20 feet. But what really took the cake is that on the third flight while hovering (with no wind gusts or controller adjustments) it shifted about two feet to the right in mid air into an absolutely tiny limb (less than the circumference of a pencil). I ""killed the engine"" and it fell about 8 feet to the ground where the arm snapped in half. This was a $300 gift from my dad 2 days ago. He died last night unexpectedly and well now I am just going to have to tell my kid sorry... sorry. We are out of luck. I have no way to contract Amazon as he ordered from his account account and they won't talk to me. As a loyal Amazon customer, I am very disappointed in Amazon as much as I am this product.

1299,5.0,Great drone! Especially for the price!,"Fantastic for the price!! I previously owned one of the original Parrot drones. It was fun, but limited flight time and only a basic camera. This drone is very easy to fly, great flight time and great features. I have gotten about 25 minutes flight time and the pictures/video are great. One of the best features is the return to home button. One press and the drone returns from where it was launched. (Within a foot so far) It is stable in a moderate breeze. The attached pictures were taken when I launched it, let it climb to approximately 200 ft straight up. It held it's position in a 2mph breeze directly above me. I took both pictures and video, then hit the return to home. Simple and safe.

I'm 49 years old and haven't played video games for probably 20 years.  I work in the tech industry, so apps and technology is not scary to me, but I'm definitely not the 16 old boy that could pick this up and fly it flawlessly the first time.  In fact, my first flight ended in a crash....not the drone's fault.  My fault and panic for sure.  It's like riding a motorcycle.  Don't focus on what you don't want to hit.  Well, my panic ensued as the drone headed for a fence line and instead of remaining calm and using the easy remote, I panicked and the drone went into the wire fence.  Amazingly, it came away unscathed except for a few nicks in the propellers.  Since then, I've flown it about 5 times, each time getting better and better.  Pros - very well made and easy to use immediately.  Set up takes just minutes and the novice can be off and flying without too much effort.  Cons - can't figure out yet how to get the propeller out of the video or pictures.  Can't find spare battery or propellers online to purchase as a backup.

One of the rotor arms ended up breaking off. I'll wrote that off as learning.<br /><br />So I bought another one, I have not gotten a single controlled flight out of it. Most of the time it'll go to take off level and just spiral down out of control and hit the ground.  It won't even take off to station keep for more than a few seconds before it becomes out of control. I've stopped using it because it'll just break.<br /><br />The hand controller is not great.  It is what it is I guess. But the phone holder function is terrible. It's not really usable so I end up having t choose between the app and the hand controller.  Makes doing videos nearly impossible unless you just turn the video on before take off.<br /><br />The App seems fine when you can use it between dealing with a barely in control drone and the hand controller.<br /><br />Disappointing purchase.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHX4UEFYTFTSHNLUWWSGP2PS6SJA,1666461841512,3,True

The drone flew beautifully, was easy to control and it was a blast! This drone has about a 26 min fly time on a single battery charge which is the best I have seen. I would however recommend getting a second battery to extend the fun time. The HS720 also has so many features found in drones costing more than 3x more.

I was immediately impressed with the apparently buid quality. I experience a problem with vibration during video, contacted the company and they sent a replacement drone quickly.  Having a nice case and the drone folding makes it very nice for transportation. The drone flies very well, the battery life seems to meet stated times and the camera works well.

1351,2.0,Not as good as you think,"Overall I think the drone has some great features and is a good value for a first time drone user, but an important thing to know is that when taking video or pictures with the camera in a horizontal position you see the propellers in the upper corners of the picture of video.  You can eliminate this by tilting the camera downward, but by doing so you lose quite a few important angles at or near horizontal.  Holy Stones YouTube promotional video is very misleading in that they never (not surprising) show any propellers in the corners of horizontal flight video clips.  I'm sure they know that far fewer potential buyers would buy this drone, despite the good price, if they knew ahead of time that essentially you're not going to want a video or picture with propellers captured in the corner of the shot or clip.  They also offer a ""Free Battery"" in a promotional piece within the drone case.  This is an important accessory since the battery takes 5 - 7 hours to recharge.  When I called to get my ""Free Battery"" they said they have no additional batteries.  It's a low priced drone, so I guess the lesson here is that you get what you pay for.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8184tW3qaNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8184tW3qaNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8184tW3qaNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHPPFEW3QS7GBR7SFVYMRVCOUSRA,1572904579930,0,False

For iPhone the Ophelia GO app is the one to use (IMHO).  Within Ophelia GO you can toggle between metric and imperial units of measure.

Selina with HS was extremely helpful and they sent a new drone which arrived quickly. The battery life is excellent and the new drone handled nearly as perfect as other more expensive drones.<br />This really is a wonderful drone for beginners and I recommend this product to ANYONE that wants to get into the hobby but wants a drone with advanced features like GPS.<br /><br />The Return to home feature missed by about 2 feet the first time but nailed it the second. I think this had a lot to do with the location I was flying. it worked well enough and I recommend giving yourself a good wide space to land.<br /><br />I took it up about 200 feet and flew it around 175 feet away in an open field with no issues.<br /><br />The carrying case is nice, although it needs straps to hold the props in place inside the case and better storage for extra batteries would be good. still... free case, can't complain!<br /><br />The only downside I can say so far (and this may be corrected later) is that there aren't really any accessories for this model. You can buy spare batteries and props but that's about it. I would totally purchase landing struts, upgraded cases, maybe a holder extender for a tablet...<br /><br />Overall, 4 stars for the drone and 5 stars for the service!<br /><br />Thank you Holy Stone!<br /><br />UPDATE.<br /><br />Selina from Holy Stone was very helpful. After going over the issue with her in detail, she is going to issue a replacement drone. I will try it and update my review again as soon as I receive it. If it works as expected, I will give more stars! Either way, I have to say that Customer Service is VERY fast and very willing to help. Thanks Selina and Holy Stone :)<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />When I got the drone it was raining. It has been 3 days and the rain finally stopped so I was excited to finally fly my new drone.<br /><br />I calibrated it as written in the instructions.<br />I made sure to have multiple satellites.<br />The gyro was calibrated.<br /><br />The drone took off and wouldn’t hover in place. Instead, it went up, flew sideways and crashed into a wall. It crashed to the ground and the emergency stop wouldn’t respond and neither would the controller. It just kept tearing itself into the brick and concrete.<br /><br />I finally had to turn it off by the button on top Which was extremely dangerous.<br /><br />I tried again and repeated the calibration steps. Same thing only when I took off and it started going crazy, I tried to descend using the joy stick and instead it flew sideways and crashed, flipped over and just kept on destroying itself.<br /><br />Contacted Customer Service for help.

First thing I notice was the case no zippered all the way & the inside zipper fully opened. I removed the plastic wrapped drone body from the case & saw that one of the propellers was under the body, not wrapped up. Thinking it was a spare I removed the body from the plastic & then realized it was broken off. I suspect that a previous buyer broke it, wrapped it back up & then Amazon took for granted it was a simple unopened returned or.... Amazon employee who supposedly checked it, simply did not.

1383,5.0,The drone is great. But the customer service is better.,Well I ended up breaking this drone on it's first flight. (Full story below) I was devastated. I reached out to Holy Stone and told them what had happened. I didn't expect much as it was my fault and they were under no obligation to help me. To my surprise they ended up sending me a replacement. I can not express how grateful for this second chance.<br /><br />Full Story<br />This is my third drone so I am not a noob at this but this is by far the most expensive one. I wanted my first flight to just learn the ropes so I stayed in my back yard. I wasn't even going to go higher then my house. I got everything ready and took off. And all of a sudden my dog jumped up and grabbed it out of the air. She let go quickly but because of this my done was out of control. In a panic I attempted to regain control and land it but  it hit a branch and entered a flat spin to the ground. As a result two arms broke off.<br /><br />I went ahead and sent an email to the company. I told them that I broke it on my first flight and asked them what my options where. At first they offered to send me a replacement arm. I was ok with that but it did require soldering to replace. A day later they told me that they were going to send out a total replacement and that I could keep the broken one. This company has total world class service and I am very grateful they put their customers first.,[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGJWF3QHNGBKEAXVRZU4MR6MAYMQ,1589597058952,0,True
1384,5.0,First Impression: Nice!,"This is the third drone I've purchased from Holy Stone (in 3 years).  It is by far the best.  My first was a 200D (2 years ago): fun to fly but not so simple to fly.  The next was a 700 (last year, not the 700D).  The HS700 is very capable but quirky.  I added the  HS700D propeller guards to my HS700 and these made the HS700 a joy to fly (landings became low-stress).  I'm happy to say that the optical flow feature of the HS720 takes care of many of the HS700 quirks.  The HS720 can fly 1-2 meters over the ground and remain very stable -- the HS700 needs to be kept higher.  The 4K camera, with in-flight tilt, is very nice (great quality video and snaps).  Is the HS720 a good selection for an absolute beginner?  As a second drone, it would be a win.  As a first drone, I'd want some help on the first flight.  My first impression is that the HS720 is a great flier and easy to setup & use.  About the only issue I can envision is that the fold-able arms for the motors might not take a lot of abuse (crashes).<br /><br />In closing, this is an ""arms-length"" review.  I've had no contact with HS about this HS720.  (btw, in the past I have found the HS support to be helpful and they do actually reply.)  After one day at the field, my HS720 is look'n good!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AERLCKKG5LCSHQ4OZZPUV5SS662A,1597858965452,0,True

Aside from my new toy being damaged, I was as concerned with what was sure to be a needlessly protracted  and costly process to get it repaired.  Not so!  The Holy Stone customer service folks never flinched.  They responded quickly, got to the bottom of things quickly, and in no time had arranged an all new unit to be sent to me.  Even suggesting I retain the original for parts!  Are you kidding me?!  That is the type of old time customer service that you just do not see anymore.  These days most companies are quick to dodge any sort of obligation after the sale.  They pay the idea lip service, but its more a markeing illusion than actual support.

There are a few hiccups with it tho such as randomly wanting to do its own thing. I ended up crashing the drone on my third flight and went straight into to a tree out of nowhere and with no wind. Even when I tried to counter act the drift with pushing the stick to the left, it still wanted to go to the right for no reason. Broke the back right arm but thank god for superglue. One other thing i’m not too much of a fan of is the latency on the fpv, makes it a bit hard to control when just looking at the screen but then again, i’m not exactly sure how it is on other drones since this is my first fpv drone. That does not stop me from having fun with this drone tho, just pure fun.

Access to support was quick and easy and they patiently took me through my startup issues (RT?M).  As I'm learning to fly, keeping the drone out of the trees has been a challenge.  It's surprising how resilient the HS720 is.  Most of the time, when I hit tree branches the drone keeps flying.  The few times when it's crashed it bounced right back and was flying again immediately.  This may be some part beginners luck :-).<br />There's been one practical application so fan and the HS720 delivered nicely.  I'm taking bids to put a 65 foot sidewalk between my rear door (north side) and my driveway (south side).

Also one time i flied it for more than 15 min and drone being SMART figured out it is running out of the juice, thus it returned from where it originally took off. safely Also I must say the photo and video quality is superb as well and I can easily download it to my phone from SD card or directly record to my phone.<br />One this I must say is that the customer service of Holystone is  alsoGREAT and I am very much impressed by their service. I had an issue with my drone one time while taking off and there was imbalance durnig the flight and thus contacted to Holystone. Since they have warranty for 90 days and I was still under that period, they send me the replacement with some brief inquiry and I am now enjoying the drone flight.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEXDNQHK6SIFLYNICM6GE2553U5A,1598756909657,0,True

1419,5.0,Excellent build quality and performance for price point.,"I purchased this drone on 18 September 2019 and have thoroughly run it through some extreme rookie test scenarios.<br />First, I must say for the price the build quality and performance exceeded my expectations.<br />The HS720 has 4 brushless motors, 2k camera, and micro SD card slot.<br />First rookie mistake, I flew the hS720 into a small tree, LOL!, leaves were flying like gnats in a dust storm. The drone stalled and dropped about 10 feet to the ground. I went over to collect it, obviously thinking it was damaged by slicing the tree leaves plus the impact with the ground.<br />To my surprise there was only a small paint scratch about the size of a needles eye on the motor arm. I had to look very hard to find the scratch. I brought the drone back to my starting point, relaunched and all the motors started with no problem. The drone lifted off and I continued to have fun flying for the day.<br />I estimate that I actually got 25 minutes from the battery. The drone automatically returned to home around 25 minutes and landed. Although I still had a cell left on the battery the drone refused to go back up into flight. I took it home and recharged the battery, which takes about 5 hours (only downside for me).<br />I had issues with the Opehiia GPS app, I could not get it to function on my phone. Three weeks later I figured out the problem.<br />Please note, for the Opehila GPS app to work you must accept all the request for access to your device (example: location, photo, media, files, make and manage phone calls). I only gave permission to the device location, which caused the Opehila GPS app not to work. It does not tell you this in English, it is just non-functional.<br />I have a spare Samsung Galaxy S6 that I was not using. I pulled it out of the draw installed the Opehila app and answered yes to all the requests and viola, it functioned perfectly, video and pictures.<br />I am very pleased with this drone, I even flew it out of sight and out of range, thought I had lost it. I was standing in a open field feeling bad for about 8 minutes, started packing what was left of my gear to head to my car. Then, I heard a humming sound, I looked up in the sky but didn’t see the drone, I pressed the down throttle and about a minute later the hs720 became visible right over the area where I had calibrated the satellite return to home settings, it WORKS! Love this little drone.<br />On another day, there were constant wind gusts between 15-30 miles per hour. I thought I would test the hs720 performance in strong wind. To my surprise the drone hovered and tried to maintain its original position. I flew it with the wind, and it soared quickly away as expected. I reversed direction and flew it against the wind and it return slowly back to me, took a while but the hs720 made it back. The flying height was 15 feet, I kept it there just in case I had to do an emergency landing.<br />I give Holy Stone 5 stars; I am sure the hs720 was not meant to endure the abuse I put it through. I highly recommend this drone to others who are considering a purchase, especially for the price point you will appreciate your decision.

1421,5.0,Good design and features (great buy),"Although I have been eager to purchase a drone for several years now, the purchase of the Holy Stone HS720 is my first purchase. The market now has a number of low cost drone options which got me back into researching a possible purchase. As a retired research engineer, I was spent hours reading reviews, watching online videos, and comparing the features and performance of many drones that are now available for what I considered cost effectiveness for my purchase. I did not just want to try to satisfy my desire for a drone with a toy although they are pretty cheap theses days. I wanted a drone with enough features and capability to satisfy me. Looking for something with great basic capabilities, ease of use, good battery performance, and decent photo and video specifications.<br />So, after extensive research, that brought me to the decision to purchase the Holy Stone HS720, and I am glad I did.  This drone has met and exceeded my expectations. I am still new at this drone pilot adventure, with more practice, I look forward to some exciting flights and great videos. As a long time photographer and videographer, with computer editing skills, I plan to make some nice DVDs with the footage from the HS720. I live in the mountains and can use the HS720 drone to help me explore areas for hiking trips.

1442,5.0,My HS720 was better than I expected. It's a nice quality flier.,"It was better than I expected. This HS720's  quality jumps out. It's solid and well built. It's not a flimsy drone. I can tell the tolerances are tight and the composite materials used for the frame are sturdy.  It has a lot of features and it's been flying really well. The provided battery holds up over 20 minutes. I'm not one to test it to the limit, but it's a nice flight time though. I ordered an extra battery because 40 or so minutes of flying is nice. The case is professional and holds most of the drone and it's accessories and it's small. The whole unit is a fine buy for the money. My flying friend has a DJI Mavic Pro and he was having a great time playing with mine. They stacked up pretty well next to each other. For a beginner - intermediate flyer, it's a champ. Only one small thing - I think the cellphone holder on the hand held remote is a tad flimsy. I'd also suggest buying another battery because  flying around for nearly an hour is a treat, which you can do with two batteries. The extra battery is great to have because recharge time can take from 7 to 7 hours. The supplied charger charges two batteries at the time though. IMO 40 plus minutes flight time is a good time in the air. Hope this helped.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFLBM656NEVGNVKCPTM7RGO3MCLQ,1573072977967,0,True

1448,5.0,"A really ""Great"" product from Holy Stone.","Starting off, I would like to say that this is the first drone or flying devise I have ever had (not counting the one I returned to Amazon previously) or tried to fly. I really am your basic beginner with this. My reason for purchasing was twofold;  1 - something to do while staying at home during this whole COVID thing, and 2 - we have an RV and camp a lot. I thought it would be handy and fun to take pictures and video of the campgrounds we stay at as well as interesting and scenic things we stop to look at.<br />Some of the things I will talk about relate to the drone I ordered before this one and returned due to several issues.<br />From the moment I opened up the box and saw the case, I knew this was a much, much better product than my previously returned (had it for about 2 weeks) drone. The case is small (since this drone is foldable) and sturdy. Has a nice handle on one side and easily fits in my hiking backpack with room to spare. When I took it out of the case it felt solid and was easy to handle. My previous drone I had a terrible time with the compass calibration but this was easy and was completed without incident the very first time. The GPS came up with 5 or 6 satellites almost as soon as I turned it on and then went on to as many as 16 or 17.  The one I returned  took a minute or two to start to connect.  Connecting  the drone WIFI with my Iphone X was also no problem, connected very quickly the first time and connected automatically each time after that. Downloading the software was also very simple. I was ready for some setup  problems, but there really were none in the whole procedure. Very smooth and simple startup the very first time. I was pretty happy and ready to fly.<br />The controller is also pretty nice. Much more comfortable than the returned one. It has two handle kind of things that fold out at the bottom making it pretty easy to hold. It takes 2 AA batteries and the phone sits at the top of the controller, easy to see. It fits the holder very nicely. The other one had the holder at the bottom which for me was harder to watch. The controller has an unlock button for the props. Just press it and they wind up for 3 - 4 seconds. No having to move the joysticks a certain way at the same time. Just press the button. The controls are very responsive and easy to use. It has a button for takeoff and landing if you want to use it. The RTH (return to home) button also works really nice. I have had it out probably a 1/4 mile or so and pressed the RTH button. It comes back all on its own and lands within 12 inches or so of where it took off from .You don't have to do anything. When it gets close you can press the button again to disengage it and do the landing yourself. The point of interest feature works great. I haven't tried the follow me feature yet.<br />Flight time after flying 6 or 7 times seems to be around 25 minutes. I haven't taken any video yet but I have taken several pictures and that doesn't seem to impact flight time much. Maybe taking video will. In the straight ahead location you do get the tips of the props on the edges but you can adjust it down a bit and get rid of them.  A couple of times there was a light breeze (5 - 7 mph I guess) and the drone seemed to handle it well. If you let it hover, it would pretty much hold its place without drifting around.<br />The camera takes really nice pictures in my opinion. They as very clear and sharp with no vibration. It will look straight ahead or straight down or anyplace in between. The adjuster is a bit touchy but you get used to it.<br />A word about Holy Stone Customer Service. It's great, both email and phone. I had occasion to use both. The email was answered with 24 hours and the phone call completely answered my question. They even called me back a few days later to make sure everything was still ok. Great service.<br />Overall, I think this is a terrific drone for a beginner like me or an experienced person. If I could change one thing, it would be the battery charge time. It does take 5 - 7 hours for a full charge. A faster charger and/or a second battery would be great. That being said, I am still very happy with this drone so far and would definitely buy another Holy Stone product and recommend them to my friends.

1457,5.0,Its worth the money twice over in everyday! 100% solid drone and solid customer service!,"This is an amazing drone!!! For 299 you get extra batteries and a dual charger as well as a badass carrying case i put a picutre of. The case they gave me with my dji sucks compared to the quality case holy stone gives you.  DO NOT waste your money on a maybe drone,  this drone is tested tried and true i love it and its the best looking drone in this price range. But this is not a toy this is what u call an adult drone its powerful brushless motors can take crashes and not even be effected. It has follow mode, way point, hover, radius, route, connects to wifi app on phone everytime, one touch take off/landing, quality pictures and videos from the movable 5k gimble,  and its smart if you go to far or it starts to run out of battery it will return to home. Also 25 minute battery life thats about 5 to 10 minutes off the absolute best. I would buy this drone over amd over again. It looks so crisp at night,  the green and red indicator light strips and the halo led u can turn on with a button on the controller.  It really is a legit drone, this isnt a toy this is classified as an adult drone becuase it has some power. Normal mode and then that high mode which you can get going past 25.miles per hour in a few seconds. It a great drone no.matter how you look at it, I am truly surprised they haven't raised the price this is a 500$ drone easy. If your thinking about it just do it. The best part about Holy Stone is there steller customer service,  i had an ongoing problem that just recently came to an end and holy stone took care of me better than I could ask or think. Imagine that a company that actually stands behind there product, good and bad. I was amazed at pretty much everything I seen and gotten from holy stone ill forever be a customer! But the hs 720 8s definitely the best one they got, u will love it. Thats a promise,  and I'm just some dude that bought one about 6 months ago lol. I went threw about 600$ of trial and error if I can stop that from happening to someone else buy encouraging them to buy holy stone products then thats what I will do.

Everything was packed nicely as well.  The battery charger has 2 slots for a second battery which is nice.  The quick start guide help with the setup and made it easy.  I was worried that my Samsung S10 would not work in the phone holder on the remote with the case on.  It was tight but it worked and held my phone just fine.  The configuration was east and I was picking up 14 satellites on the remote.  I like the unlock button on the remote so you won't launch by mistake.  Takeoff was easy and the auto hover worked great.  Camera was very stable with a smooth picture and video. The controls responded as expected.  As I flew it I got a little more comfortable with it and took it up to 300'.  No problems with the controls and handle the upper winds just fine.  I hit the return to home function and she came home within 2' from where it took off from.  I did received about 30 mins fly time which I liked.

I took it out today and initially everything was going fine. However, I put the drone in orbit function and after it made approximately six loops around me it suddenly took off in a straight line and kept going. The drone would no longer respond to the remote control and I had to just stand there and watch the drone fly away. I thought that once it had gone far enough to lose the gps signal (which it did) that it would automatically return home. Unfortunately, it did not do that. This drone was an upgrade from my last Holystone drone, which had done the same exact thing, I suppose I should’ve learned my lesson after the first drone flew off never to be seen again. That’s two Holystone drones that stopped responding to their remotes and I’ve had to watch them both fly off along with my money.

1470,5.0,All I can say is Wow!,"This is my second drone from Holy Stone. After buying the small HS165 and having a great experience with both the drone and their customer service (not to mention the ""omg this is so fun!"" feeling when flying it), I decided to buy this drone as an upgrade.<br /><br />The construction feels very sturdy and the drone has some real ""heft"" to it. The case fits everything perfectly, so it will be well protected and easy to transport. The manual is clear and concise, and getting everything ready to go for the first basic flight was just a matter of reading a few pages of the manual and following the instructions.<br /><br />Once it was flying, I noticed a few differences between this and the smaller drone. This one has a very different sound to it because of the larger brushless motors. It's not loud, but there's a solid ""angry bees"" sound to it. You can tell there's some serious power turning the blades. The responsiveness is amazing. It maneuvers very quickly and is quite fast. It was a bit windy on the day of my first flight, but it made virtually no difference to this drone and I was able to fly it around the house and over a bunch of trees with ease and good stability.<br /><br />I've only taken a few pictures and videos, but the quality seems to be good (especially when I pay attention to where the sun is. Ha!) and it's simple and quick to snap pictures and start/stop the video.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying out some of the more advanced features (follow-me, point of interest, pathing, etc), but my house is surrounded by some trees and power lines, so I'll wait until I get get in a more open area to check those out.<br /><br />I'd like to give a final shout-out to the Holy Stone customer service folks. I've been in contact with them a few times and they've always been amazingly response and helpful. I have no qualms at all about their products because I know they'll stand behind them and be there to support me when I have questions.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFTHAYFXLTBG6H3PJUEYHJEQDANA,1585923843375,0,True

1473,2.0,Ok for big open spaces. Great customer service,"My son got a cheap drone for Christmas, so I purchased the HS720 to give us something to do together.  The main things that drive me to chose the HS720 was the GPS/RTH functions. I received the drone on a Friday and started flying it the next day. It was very easy to learn, especially since I had been using my son’s drone for the last several weeks. On Sunday, I decided to be brave and use some of the additional features that the HS720 has to offer. I flew the drone up over the tree line and programmed a route on the map using the trace function about a quarter to a half of the size of a city block. The drone should have never been out of my line of site. I watched the drone go to its first point on the trace and it just kept going. I hit the RTH button several times only to watch it keep flying away.<br /><br />That evening, I contacted Holy Stone. I fully expected them to tell me to go pound sand. After a few discussions and some negotiations, their rep Engy agreed to send me a brand new drone.<br /><br />I received the new drone a couple of days later and immediately began flying again.  This past Saturday I took the drone to a public park to do a little flying. First two flights went great. Flew over the ponds, got some cool alligator pics, etc. I flew until my first battery was about dead.<br /><br />We did some walking and came to another spot where I wanted to get some pics. I did all of the set up, like I have always done (rotate horizontal 3x, rotate very 3x). Got the solid red and green lights. Set it in the ground and prepared for take off. I hit the auto take off button. Normally, it would raise about 5’ and hover steady. This time, it would not stay still. Before I knew it, it hit a shrub tree and was in the pond. Don’t know what caused it to go off course, but it absolutely would not hold its position. I now have one lost drone and one wet drone.<br /><br />With all that said, this drone would be great for wide open spaces where you are going to fly very low and there is no possibility that you could have a water landing. The times we flew over the big fields, the drone did great, but I didn’t have to worry about hitting anything if it made any unanticipated moves. If you are planning to fly in anything other than an open field, then this is. It the drone for you.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHFCJQ3R3E5KHRQNTIQB3UDDG3XA,1581962534472,6,True
1474,5.0,A good quality drone for a beginner,"I wanted a drone to take video footage for our travel blog, and I spent quite a lot of time reviewing the available drones. The Holy Stone HS720 seemed to be have a good feature set at a reasonable price, so I took the plunge.<br /><br />After receiving the drone, I read the manual, watched a few videos on flying drones, and charged the battery. Then I found an open area and took it out for a spin. Here are my observations:<br />- Construction and quality. I was immediately impressed at the overall quality of the drone. Everything folds up and stows nicely in a padded, lunch box sized case.<br />- Easy for a beginner to learn. This is my first drone, and I wanted enough artificial intelligence to prevent me from crashing it or watching it fly away over the horizon while I learned how to fly it. I had no trouble getting the hang of it.<br />- Good camera. Since the whole purpose of the drone was to take video footage for our blog, the camera  should be stabilized and have reasonable resolution. This isn't a $5000 ( or even a $1500) drone, so I wasn't expecting cinematic quality footage. Overall, I found the video quality to be quite adequate for our needs and better than I anticipated.<br />- Return to home (RTH) feature. The RTH function is, in my opinion, the most important AI feature of the drone. If the communication link is lost, the battery becomes dangerously low, or the RTH button is pressed, the drone rises to a safe altitude, returns to the take-off point and automatically lands. My biggest fears were that I'd watch my new drone fly over the horizon, never to be seen again, or the motors would quit, causing the drone to crash. I pressed the RTH button when the drone was several hundred feet away, and the drone returned and landed exactly as advertised.<br />- Circle a point. An experienced drone operator can pilot a drone in a circle around a point, keeping the camera aimed at the object of interest, and maybe I'll be there someday. In the meantime, the HS720 will, with the press of a button, do this automatically. I haven't quite mastered the process - the drone has to be positioned at just the right distance from the object of interest or it won't be the center of the circle, but I still got some reasonable footage on my first attempt.<br />- Follow an object. On command, the drone will follow the remote at a distance of 50 or so feet, useful if you want some footage, for example, of yourself while walking or jogging.<br />- Battery life. The battery lasted almost 20 minutes, considerably longer than I expected. Since this was my first time flying this drone (or any drone for that matter), I did a lot of hovering and slow speed maneuvers, so this may have contributed to the long battery life.<br /><br />Overall, I was quite pleased with the drone, but there were a couple of annoyances.<br />- Manual. The manual wasn't bad, but assumed I knew more about drones than I did. I found some of the instructions confusing and hard to follow. Perhaps a more experienced operator would have had an easier time.<br />- Battery charge time. It takes about six hours to recharge the battery, way too long in my opinion. Having a couple of spare batteries would help, but at the time of this review, spare batteries are not available (although they are promised soon), and it's unknown what the cost of spares will be.<br /><br />All in all, I'm quite happy with my new drone.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHX3J7Q63CIFEG6Z4X2KROSFCZVA,1574603135364,0,True

About half way through the battery life, the drone has limits on height and distance to make sure it's within range if the battery gets critically low, which I appreciate. The drone also has different speed modes which are helpful.<br /><br />The full battery distance and height ranges are really impressive and the app has a lot of features.

GPS, home, orbit, and follow-me all work very well (as long as you have at least 9 satellites)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Shaky camera - not as noticeable at lower fps<br />2. Requires current premium phone with 5ghz wifi - my iphone 7 only allows for a max of 200m wifi range, making the camera useless in real time at long range.<br />3. Camera has a dead sensor, and there is a white pixel in the near center of all the video I record.<br />4. Does not have obstacle avoidance, and if auto-flying by GPS it will fly into anything in it's path without your control (unless you turn off GPS auto flight functions).<br />5. Transmission is slightly delayed, so controls are not as sharp as other drones of the same type<br /><br />I will be contacting Holystone regarding the dead sensor to see if that can be fixed, or if it needs exchanged.

The adjustment camera angle while flying is extremely helpful.  And the RTH (Return To Home) has been flawless - either when pushing the button manually, when I flew it too far and it lost signal, or when the battery is getting low.  A very compact and sturdy drone for beginners.

This is outstanding customer service and they really do appear to stand behind their products.  I will give it another run and hopefully the new drone works out much better.  I see mostly 5 star review and want to be like them, happy with the drone.]<br /><br />This drone has dangerous issues with control.  I followed all of the directions to set the calibrations by spinning the drone, I synced it to my wifi, checked the connections and the satellites, and all rest.  On it's first flight it went nuts right after take off and slammed into the trees across the street, but luckily hit the grass and took the hit well.  I was then able to fly it for a few days well.  Included are shots from Central Park in Huntington Beach, California to prove I learned how to fly it without issue.  The drone pulled the same stunt a few days later, but I was able to luckily force it down and it was alright on the second uncontrolled flight.  Well, today I took it down to the beach at PCH in Huntington Beach, CA.  I did all of the calibrations and syncing, it showed 17 satellites, and full connection.  I took it off and then when I tried to make it elevate it shot up about 70 feet, banked hard towards PCH and went full blast across the street (that sucked, I was 400 yards away and blasted into some palm trees across PCH and hit the Condos.  Where it landed, I do not know after an hour search.  I hope someone from the condos calls off the phone number I wrote on it.  I am glad it didn't hurt someone or damage someone's car.  I can't recommend this drone at all with a dangerous issue like that, which also costs you the entire purchase price of the drone.  Is anyone in the market for the controller?

1506,3.0,Crashed with broken arm after 4 short flights - poor GPS?,I was delighted to get the HS 720 as a gift. The instructions and the app were a bit intimidating for an old guy. However there are several helpful videos. I finally did two successful short flights but after that the drone would calibrate then fail to start. A few days later I was able to do two more short flights. The Return To Home did not work but I was able to pilot the drone back. On the last flight the drone hovered near me at 5 ft then crashed at an angle into the street when I tried to land it. This caused a rear arm to break. Repairing it is beyond my skill level.<br /><br />I'm posting this review as the crash and the failure to start was probably due to a poor GPS signal.  Do not try to fly unless you have a good GPS signal!

1516,5.0,A very good drone for the money and fun to fly,"I purchased this drone after looking at the features and reading reviews of various drones.  First, overall, this a very good drone for the money.  I was pleasantly surprised by the features and that everything worked as advertised.  This is the first Holly Stone drone I have used or set up, I took a little time to do so.  First, I recommend that any purchaser review the full manual in its entirety along with the quick start manual before setting up the drone or attempting flight.  Second, download the Ophelia Go software.  Once you have familiarized yourself with the set up procedures and controls, the drone is easy to set up and to fly.  My only glitch was trying to set up the compass calibration as the icon on the controller disappeared too fast, but the Ophelia software took care of calibration later.  For beginners, trying set up or fly the drone without understanding the manual and controls will very likely lead to problems.<br /><br />Once set up, the drone flew perfectly.  I have tested the drone in winds up to 12-13 mph.  The controls and camera worked as expected.  The camera can be swiveled in a 90 degree arc.  From directly forward to a down position. That works well.  Due to the software, the drone can hover in place without effort on the part of the operator.  That alone sets it apart from several drones and makes flying this drone a pleasure.  I have taken panoramic videos hovering at 200ft, and videos while flying the drone at full speed 2 feet above the ground.  I have found that the drone can move too fast for the video function and there can be some lag.  Pictures are saved within the Ophelia app if you do not use a memory card in the drone.  From my reading, pictures are saved at a lower resolution in the app than on the memory card.<br /><br />Next,  I tested the ""follow me"" function.  This one is finicky.  Too far away and the drone seems to lose its connection.  When it works, it works as advertised.  I did this test at walking speed, so I don't know if there are any speed limitations to this function.  The ""orbit flight"" works.  I have not tried the ""headless mode"" yet.  The ""tap fly"" function works, but I would prefer that I be able to set a route before the drone is in the air.  A route is traced out and the drone flys to the waypoint and stops briefly before moving to the next waypoint.  Working with this program function some more may reveal additional tricks.  However, given the price of this drone, the software is excellent.  Another great feature is the ""return to home"" function.  One button to recall the drone.  In my tests, the drone consistently landed within 2 feet of its take off point using this function.  On one return, the drone landed within 6 inches of its takeoff point.<br /><br />The major con for this drone is the battery.  The battery last about 25 minutes.  It takes about 5 hours to recharge (5v/2a).  A test using 5v/1.6a charger takes about 7 hours.  The dual battery charger that comes with the drone really only charges one battery at time.  It charges them consecutively instead of concurrently.  For the time, you will need several batteries if you want to fly a long time.  Another con, but this may be the phone.  The Ophelia app/phone seems to lose connection with the drone on occasion when the drone is more than 6-700 feet away.  This does not seem to affect the return to home function.  Once the drone is recalled using the controller, and gets closer, the drone generally reconnects, but not always.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the drone.  Since it is easy to fly, it is easy to have fun.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VIqrhwFnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VIqrhwFnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91VIqrhwFnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEDJMIDCE4LNZOFNXRYKQTF5B3AQ,1608665316504,1,True
1517,5.0,HS720 review,"Excellent drone, easy to learn, great range (as described, about 1km), returns ""home"" when signal is lost. Make sure to calibrate it EVERY TIME though. Very stable in light wind, holds position amazingly well, unlike cheaper model (under $100) that we had prior to HS720. I saw people complaining about image and video quality. I am very happy about both. Good resolution, a little round along the edges (video) but it's OK. Touch & feel is of quality materials and quality construction. Flight time about 20 min, which is amazing compared to same price point competition. Phone slips out from remote phone holder at times, because the bottom ""lip"" is too narrow, but that's OK, we found an alternative solution. Battery is ""solid"", literally and figuratively, high quality, easy to put in and take out, unlike cheaper ""twist-wire-every-time"" tiny connectors on cheaper model we had.

1518,5.0,Fantastic!,"I am brand new to the drone hobby but decided to try the HS720 4K because it shows good reviews.  Although I'm a slow learner I finally got all my ducks in a row and got the drone working but my phone display was not showing the camera view.  I loved the flight operation when I test flew it.

1525,5.0,Novice review of the HS720,"I don't normally write reviews but felt inclined to do so on this product.  I have only had the drone a couple days.  I am 100% noive...first drone and first time doing anything RC. The night i received i got stupid and took it up in the house.  Needless to say hard crash into ceiling, couple walls and fridge before coming to a slam down rest on a hardwood floor.  I cant stress ""hard"" enough and the drone doen't have a scratch on the body or legs.  The props did sustain very minor nicks.  Flew outside the next day and this drone is easy to take off and land with the one touch button.  Hovers nicely with a little toilet bowl action (not a big deal).  Controls are easy to operate and the camera switch works grt.  The phone holder holds my galaxy 9 note just fine.  Didn't get to use many funtions but the one touch on/off (take off & land).  But that works grt.  Highly recommend this drone for the novice and/or experienced.<br /><br />One note...the antennas DO actually aquire sats.  I had them pointed down (due to watching youtube vids that advised they are non-functional) and could not aquire any sats.  Turned them up and aquired 13 sats.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEHTXQJP3KU4ZXZ4TSBTHUDK2O3Q,1579890148098,0,True

Some of the things that I like about this drone:<br />• Drone: Solid look and feel of drone – yes its mostly plastic but has survived a few bumps and crashes. The brushless motors/propellers are pretty quiet and responsive. The drone drifts a bit, might be one of my propellers is off a bit.<br />• Remote/Controller: nice quality – the LCD is helpful and provides basic info. Your phone is held pretty well in the springs/clips to where it does not feel like it will fall out.<br />• iOS APP – works well and simple to use. Easy to set limits and advanced configs<br />• Battery – easy :20 or so each time.  It is SLOW to charge and would be great if a 2nd battery was included in the base package.<br />• Support – fast response. Helped to remediate my problem quickly and without bickering over cost, etc.  Customer-first attitude!<br />• Camera – clear picture, no problems.  I do wish the rotation was bit slower from the remote as it’s a bit fast and jerky moving up/down.<br />• Case – a nice bonus.

The drone survived hitting a wall and multiple trees with only a few scratches and nicks. It has noticeably heavy duty construction that's made to absorb some beginner mistakes.

1600,5.0,Takes a tiny bit of work but once it's going it is a breeze,"This is the first drone I've ever bought or owned and it is unbelievable how intuitive it is! Make sure to first start using it in an open area, just to be safe. However, I began using it in my backyard and there were multiple times when I thought I would crash it into my house or a tree or bush but the controller is so responsive that even the slightest flick in the opposite direction will save it. Even then, I got cocky and tried to test my skills and crashed it into a playset and, while trying to correct, slammed into a palm tree. The drone went down and stopped running immediately and I feared the first. Sure enough, the drone was absolutely fine and operated like the crash never happened. I even accidentally put my finger in the blades while they were running when I went to pick it up and it didn't damage them and all it did to me was make my finger numb for 10 seconds. I cannot suggest this drone enough for pretty much anyone, I bought it for recording paintball and it has already been useful despite my neglectful care. I suggest 13+ because it is difficult to understand the effect and power video capturing drones hold, specifically considering privacy so 13+ is probably best, 18+ realistically. Similarly, at 32 with 25 years of video game experience I still struggled to learn the controls and could have very easily crashed into a power line if I was not careful.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGU7EFJWNE55BYTWBRPQNUAFSZKQ,1677821189361,5,True
1601,4.0,"Read the manual carefully, get a landing pad","The Holy Stone HS720 is a very easy drone to fly. I have some experience, but each drone is a little different, so I can't suggest strongly enough to read the manual carefully. After charging the batteries fully, and finding an unobstructed area to test the drone. After reading the manual to the point that the pages were falling out of the manual, I went through all the procedures to start the drone. Be patient. It takes some time for the drone to communicate with the controller and phone, if you choose to use one. I set up the landing pad, (which I strongly recommend, too) and started the drone. I found the controls very responsive, and the interface between phone and camera to take some getting used to. It locked upon several times so there were times I didn't know exactly where the drone was. Twice during the initial flight, the connection between the drone and the controller was lost. The drone immediately hovered to 50 or so feet, and returned to the landing pad and hovered. I tried to take several videos and pictures, but to no avail. I used a Sandisk Extreme, 64gb card in the drone. It is my opinion the recording would be the fastest if recorded directly to a card instead of recording from drone to my phone through the app. Further testing on this will be required. After the long recharging time. The charge cord is way too short, and the Holy Stone company needs to review this as well.<br />The Ophelia app is a little confusing, but I feel even a novice or beginner can learn it pretty quickly with practice. The best way to answer any questions is the internet as the manual offers little insight into the operation of the app.<br />This is a fun drone to fly, Even at the slowest speed, it is responsive, quick, and nimble. And don't forget to get a landing pad that is at least 30"". Mine is 32"" and the drone can easily find it. Every landing I made was within those 32"", which is pretty impressive.

Connected it, raised it up about 1 foot off the ground to have a big gust of wind flip it over into a bed of wood shavings!  After finally finding the OFF button, we picked it up and dusted it off. Amazingly, none of the propellers were broken! The second time I tried flying, I raised it up and watched the wind take it away again and almost hit a car! Needless to say I need a few more lessons on flying. But the ease of use with the remote control is nice!

I have flown r/c helicopters for many years and decided to check out all of the drone hype. After purchasing the hs720 and flying it, I noticed some issues with it’s flight characteristics. I was real nervous making the call to “Customer Service “ to explain my situation regarding the drone. My past experience has not been a good one when dealing with companies over the phone about their products. To my surprise, it was just the opposite. I spoke with Jan and he was very curious about the issues, asked lots of questions and then resolved my situation with a smile. Most often, products purchased through the “Mail” of the electronics nature become a “One and Done” type thing. My experience with Holystone has made me a trusting customer that with now purchase future products from them with confidence.<br />As for the hs720, it lives up to the hype of all of the reviews I read. Easy, stable and is enjoyable to fly. Battery life is pretty close to stated times although I haven’t clocked them with a stopwatch. Product is durable and well worth the money.

1607,4.0,"First ""real"" drone... Intuitive","[[VIDEOID:4d561cd22479c1d6347699801c1bd487]] After a month, I can say that I'm very happy with this drone.  It's easy to use. It took me more time to learn how to use the droid app then it did to run the drone controls.  The battery life is great.  I had it actually ""go home"" once, after a low battery.  It landed within a foot of where it started more than 20 minutes earlier.<br /><br />I have a few photos and videos, including one of the drone.  The lens gives  you some ""fish eye"" effect for those portions in the picture that are above or below the horizontal center line.  North Dakota lakes gives you big horizons to look over.  I've run it in temperatures as low as 10 degrees F (-12C), it did great.  There was a steady 10MPH winds during the day of the fishing tournament.<br /><br />It takes some time to figure out how to get the best possible shots while flying as wind and sudden movements can cause you to lose subject.  I'll eventually upgrade to a drone with a better gimbal and glass, but this setup will help me build some confidence.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OhgiMCv8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OhgiMCv8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OhgiMCv8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715EV0L29FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715EV0L29FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715EV0L29FL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a--WpnNSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a--WpnNSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a--WpnNSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AG3OCGOE2IKQTT3JHOT5KML4UNVA,1580702841659,0,True

I'm guessing well over 40mph. Video quality not the best but just okay. On occasions I found the auto take off were wobble or it had problems finding a steady footprint, so I only manually take off.

1641,4.0,It was ok,"So I originally purchased this drone a few weeks ago.  When I received it initially it wouldn't connect to my phone no matter what I did.  So I sent it back to the manufacturer and got a refund.  I was done with it, but the Holy Stone people got a hold of me so they could send me a drone at no cost to me.  Yaay.  So when I got the new drone it worked just as expected.  It connected to my phone and all of the features worked perfectly.  My only issue was that the right joystick on the remote doesn't go back to center, I have to hold it manually to keep it from steering off course.  The spring must be broken on that side or something.

1642,1.0,DANGEROUS. NEEDS RECALLED,"Earlier today when I flew this drone (about 10th time), when everything looked fine, all of a sudden it rapidly rolled (as if 2 motors on one side had lost power) and hurtled towards and hit the ground at very high velocity and destroyed itself completely. It was at around 200 meters altitude when this happened and took, I’d say, less than 2-3 seconds to make contact with the ground. In those few seconds I was extremely concerned that it would hit someone because it traveled down like a bullet and could have caused serious damage had it done that. Amazon and Holystone should investigate why this happened and recall the product before someone dies.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AG6AMCLDDBTHWV567OTNH54NST7Q,1614555604977,1,True
1643,1.0,Repeated fatal flaws on multiple units,"This was a gift for our son, who is 9, and he had no issues flying the drone.  The flight was stable and simple enough for him.  Using the Opelika go app while flying seems to occasionally cause flight control errors.<br /><br />Now for the fatal flaw.  We grabbed a battery off the charger and headed out to a field for a quick flight session.  The battery level.for the drone showed full charge prior to takeoff.  I launched the drone and increased the altitude to approximately 40 ft.  Suddenly the warning tone sounded and the drone started blinking red.  Ok, so the battery went form full to read in less the 15 seconds.  I immediately started lowering the drone so we could land it but the 2 of the motors shut off less than 5 seconds after the low battery indications started causing it to drop out of the sky.  I was going to try and catch it as it fell but 2 of the motors were still running and I was concerned about being injured by one of the 2 remaining spinning rotors.  When it crashed into the snowy ground all 4 rotor arms broke off the main body.<br /><br />This drone is supposed to have a safe return to home feature where it will return to where it launched from if the battery is low.  Obviously there is something wrong with the battery level sensor where it does not start the return process early enough to complete the return once the battery gets low.  The drone was only 40 feet above where it had launched and only had enough warning to descend 3 feet's before it came crashing down.  I don't see how you can ever trust this feature and the battery warning and prevent routinely crashing and breaking $300 drones?<br /><br />Holy Stone sent me a replacement.  When flying the replacement in our backyard I was simy hovering the drone in the middle of the yard away  from any obstacles.  Instead of staying steadily in the middle of the yard it began to slowly drift in a circle.  That circle got progressively wider, and the controls were unresponsive, eventually crashing the drone into the house resulting in one of the arms breaking.<br /><br />This is the 3rd Holy Stone drone I've had with fatal flaws.  The DJI mini series is more expensive but than these but entirely worth the extra cost if you can afford it.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AH7XKCPY7WSBTBXPFKOFLOVNAZSA,1640699889794,10,True

1645,4.0,Not bad…not quite great,"Almost ended up returning this item.  Bought it to teach my kids to fly as it was advertised as a good mid-range option to learn on.  It is well built mechanically and worked ok based on the maiden flight.  As some other users pointed out, there are some definite bugs with the software.  It took multiple attempts to get it to calibrate itself and for the life of me I could not get it to hover in place as advertised, until I used a newer phone.  It continued to drift in circles absent input from the controls initially, which is an issue if you aren’t familiar with them. Also, controls were spongy at first.  The remote also would periodically unpair mid-flight, which is also problematic.  I’m going to chalk it up to software incompatibility, as the issues pretty much abated with a different phone. Would give it 5 stars if they correct some of the minor issues.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGGDFZCQV7F25ADG3AEIY4HS6XAQ,1665257462905,4,True

Customer Service is awesome,"Update 9/17/2020- Original can be found at the bottom:<br /><br />Thank you HolyStone, specifically Mila, who helped me with my issue. I'm hopeful that this time I'll have a better experience when I go out..<br /><br />Customer Service A++ in my book<br />_________________<br /><br />Update 9/12/2020<br /><br />Today I got the chance to fly my HS720 for the second time. This drone, flew away!!<br /><br />I took it out to capture content for a YT video.<br /><br />I ensured my preflight was followed; Full Batteries on Drone and Controller. No interference, No weather related issues such as heat/ cold/ rain/ wind. I performed my Gyro, and GPS calibrations as I normally would with all drones. Connected my phone (Galaxy S10+) with the drones WiFi successfully. Checked settings in app were acceptable and initiated flight, hover; started recording immediately.<br /><br />I rechecked my battery levels proceeding with the next task, a Follow me. Again ensuring flight safety for the planned task (weather, interference, people, etc). It followed me for about 100feet, before video on my phone showed the drone flying away (banking right); Signal between Phone and Controller was lost. Map in app on my phone was checked to see if the last known position had been saved.<br /><br />Needless to say, the map data was incorrect. There was 3 of us out there searching for the drone, my 720 is gone, am pretty mad about it as the flight was conducted with absolute situational awareness.<br /><br />I have emailed support, hoping for some help, however, in reading prior reviews, am not certain what if anything HolyStone would do. As of this writing I am awaiting a response.<br /><br />_____________Original Review below____________<br /><br />Received this within 24hrs of order, got lucky.<br /><br />I was hoping that many reviews overlooked the gyro calibration, however, they did not. Holystone failed to add in the stick movement to complete gyro calibrations. It seems like Left and right sticks to seven o'clock, hold 5seconds. But if I am mistaken, please, correct me.<br /><br />Recommend to gyro, then gps calibrate. Once that is complete then unlock the motors and happy flying.<br /><br />Looking forward to many flights.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHPLRA7WC25CL5OEYLB2VKUIQDYA,1599466511426,1,True

I sent my concerns to Holystone support and they responded right away with a number of things to try to remedy the issue. After trying the items they suggested the issue was still present. They were very sympathetic and interested in resolving the issue for me right away, so they decided to replace the drone with a brand new replacement.

1652,5.0,This is the perfect Drone for a 1st timer that wants some of the higher priced Drone features!,"Hello, future Drone owners.  I have always wanted a Drone but heard too many horror stories where the Drone flew off never to be seen again. Most of the drones I looked at with the features I wanted were always way more money than I dared to spend to potentially watch my money fly away.  After years of waiting, I finally decided to buy this one. I have never flown anything prior to this. It was so easy to fly. The button on the remote that allows it to take off and hover at 5 feet on its own is awesome. From there you can just move the levers around on the controller and watch what each level does. Thank you Holy Stone for making it so easy to enjoy this device with very little stress. You cant buy a better Drone in my book for less than $300 I highly recommend buying it.

1653,4.0,Great Bird for the Price,"Great drone for the price. I originally considered a different drone but after reading reviews I opted for the HS720. It comes with a very nice carrying case that holds the drone, remote and my spare batteries.<br /><br />The setup is easy to follow and will have you flying in a few minutes (once your battery is charged). Pairing the remote with the bird, calibrating the GPS and connecting your phone to the bird via the app is all there is to it.<br /><br />I’ve flown the drone a few times and it’s an easy and stable flyer.  I would never fly in high winds but have flown this drone in 6-10 mph surface winds and it hovers in place as advertised when using GPS.  I’ve had the bird at some significant heights and it holds position very well.<br /><br />I’ve used the flight path mode several times and it works great. I have not used follow me or or it mode but assume they will work good too.<br /><br />The controls are straightforward and responsive. I have had the joystick on the right side stick once but attribute that to operator error.<br /><br />The camera is stable and good.<br /><br />My only issue is with the battery charging. The connections feel weak and are awkward. That’s the only reason I didn’t give a 5 star review<br /><br />Reviews I’ve read say this drone can compete with the high end birds from DJI and others.

1656,5.0,Easy to learn drone,"Update 07/15/20: So as to not have a backup HS720 another HS720 was ordered and received. This new HS720 flew perfectly. The photos taken of part of my property look very good. The learning curve for the HS720 is an easy one, even for a beginner. The only issue I have with the HS720 is the very long battery charging time.<br /><br />Update 07/09/20: Looks like Murphy's law wins after all. The new HS720 arrived, but the camera was DOA. The new HS720 was returned and refunded. Is Holy Stone losing its grip on quality control?<br /><br />Update 07/03/20: I have flown this drone a number of times more. Occasionally I get a loss of signal for a few seconds, but the connection always returns. I contacted Holy Stone about my issue and they asked if there were a lot of trees nearby. The answer is yes there are a lot of trees. Customer support suggested flying my drone in a more open area to avoid losing signal. Even with my issue, this drone has been able to see my 30 acre property in a way not seen before. I was even able to see a beaver swimming in my pond using the drone from hundreds of yards away. The videos have been outstanding. I have had this drone to maximum height and far enough away to stop WiFi returning a video to my phone. Return to home always works. BTW, I have used this drone with both the iPhone SE and Samsung Note 8. To keep this bird in the air longer, I now have four batteries. To ensure that I'm never without this drone functionality, I ordered another hs720  today. Since I will have a spare, Murphy's law should not apply?<br /><br />I am new to drones and bought this drone based on reviews, mostly from beginners. I found using the controls and Holy Stone Go app easy to use. My cellphone is an iphone SE. I love the ability of this drone to hover in place when not touching any of the controls. I did have one problem. When I tried to use the home button with the drone below a tree the drone rose up an hit the tree branches. This impact damaged the propellers. What I learned was that on hitting the home button that the drone will rise up to ~90ft and then return home. That is done to avoid hitting a low object on returning home. I was glad that Holy Stone supplied extra propellers. Since this mistake I have not had any other issue with this drone. The photos are great where we are now able to see my property from height. This drone is well worth the $300 price. I also purchased extra batteries since the recharge time is pretty long.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817N9whXgKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817N9whXgKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817N9whXgKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WVMAog4pL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WVMAog4pL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WVMAog4pL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGWYX4VP5QDPPU4YMHSEKNRXXHGA,1592403376391,0,True

1660,5.0,A great drone & super value!  Very happy with purchase!,"After researching and some hesitation, I purchased the HS720 with 4K UHD Camera.  And I just took it out this weekend!  It was fun, easy and truly enjoyable!  I look forward to gaining more experience and testing out all the functions as time goes by.<br /><br />But as a beginner, I found the HS720 easy to use.  From out-of-the-box to the field, it’s pretty straightforward and nearly intuitive.  The case is very nice.  I downloaded the app – real simple – and away I went.  No problem!<br /><br />The remote feels comfortable , the display is easy to read, and the joysticks are easy to use and very responsive.  It’s a small drone (or smaller than I was expecting but, again, this is my 1st drone) but nothing feels cheap; the drone, remote, controls all feel sturdy.<br /><br />Set up was easy and then the actual flight was a great experience.  Fast and fun - flight was easy and responsive. There was a small breeze but, even then, it flew very stable.  (But as the winds picked up, I went inside.)  It does take time to charge the batteries . . . but, after researching other drones, it doesn’t seem out of line compared to other brands/models.<br /><br />While not all functions were tested, this one has just about all one would want/need.  Auto land worked well. Follow Me & GPS Return to Home were simple and east to learn.<br /><br />Again, I wanted a drone for a novice that represented a good investment.  Holy Stone has a great reputation . . . this is a very nice drone with lots of excellent features - 4K camera that pivots 90 degrees, quiet brushless motors, easy to use controller, app that is easy to follow.

It has 1 key take off/ landing which make it pretty easy to get started. Their auto return home/ smart GPS return home never worked for me. Even i flew it in good GPS signal zone, as soon as I hit the auto return button it took of the opposite way and I have to manual control to bring it back. Bad hover ability drone keep shaking to both side or till to left or right. Can not fly under breezy condition, even small wind could take it away.<br /><br />Function: follow me never works whenever I used it the drone turn to a random way and just stand there. Point of interest works good but under perfect weather, as if it breezy a little bit the drone would be carried away off your designated location, and you have to get into the apps to stop the function as I see very annoying. NEVER use follow path, my drone took off immediately as soon as I active it and crashed down.<br /><br />Video: i doubt their 4K camera advertising, since all video file i took seem very blurry and glitched, even that was the video save on SD cards. Moreover the camera captures a little bit of both propeller on both side, so you really need to edit the video to get a ""professional"" one.<br /><br />Connection: the remote controls range pretty good, but not wifi treaming connection from drone to your phone.

The DJI Mavic mini looks great but several hundred more and consumer feedback isnt even comparable. I do love how Holystone customer service is the best around. Always friendly, professional and ready to help. Highly recommend and stoked on my new Drone. Thanks Holystone! Highly recommend.<br /><br />Update: so impressive- flys fast and like a dream. Very well built and top notch quality. Very easy to fly once you get it setup. Return to home is very accurate. I am pleased with camera- its good enough. You also need to ensure you are in slow speed and using a memory card for best results. Keep in mind I paid $250 for this drone on sale and got two batteries with case. Mavic mini is $500 and twice the price. If I was using it to shoot professional photos it would be worth difference but if I had $500 i would just buy two HS720. It has some weight 450 grams so it hovers very well- wind hardly touches it. Very stoked with it. There is a reason this drone has almost 700 reviews on Amazon and Mavic Mini less than 100!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHO7NCAJGOQHE4IG2DOZ2FUJV5FQ,1577318555740,0,False

1678,5.0,Great drone for beginners,"I bought this drone for my son who is 12 and is our first outdoors drone.  The quality of the build is obvious from the moment you open the cardboard box. The quality of the drone body, the propellers, the motors etc. are excellent. The fact that the arms fold in make the drone very compact when carrying it or not in use. The carrying case is very well designed and you feel that the drone is very secure in the case.  Setup and pairing the drone to the controller was a breeze and we were able to complete the setup in less than 10 mins. The first flight was very easy and the return to home feature makes you feel confident of trying out different features. We tried the return to home 4-5 times and every time the drone came to within a foot of where it launched from..The only improvement opportunity that  I could  see is that the charge time for the battery is close to 7 hours. Understand that the drone uses a lot of power, but the  long charge time would make one  plan way in advance of actual flying.<br />We will update the review after we have tried out the "" follow me"" and ""waypoint"" feature , but after a day of flying we couldn't have been more pleased.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ku3KbjdVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ku3KbjdVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ku3KbjdVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eXmAkz5XL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eXmAkz5XL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81eXmAkz5XL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AH7GR4BD3I6U67X3FDBYHB4CMPIA,1574813953900,0,True

1680,1.0,Don't waste your money,"Bought this as my first drone. Seemed like a good, user friendly model. When it showed up, it was well built, easy to use, easy to learn how to use and easy to fly. My first few flights, I had in beginner mode, stayed close to home and didn't fly too high. As I got more comfortable, I began flying higher and farther. Everything was going great, until it wasn't. For no reason whatsoever, I lost complete control and the drone flew in a big circle while descending, and crashed into a pond. Customer support was no help. All they did was offer 10% off a new drone. Not just the drone though, I had to buy an entire new kit. They don't sell just the drone. Well, being an idiot, thinking it was fun, and maybe this was just a fluke problem, I bought another one. Same story, flew carefully on nice days, seemed like everything was good, flew up to look at our local water tower (I'm the city water guy) and the drone battery dropped to 2 bars right after I took off, so it tried to return itself to the home position, I had no control, and again, made a big circle while descending, and crashed into the neighbors trees and I am unable to retrieve it.

1688,5.0,Great for beginners and intermediate users with powerful features at an affordable price.,"First time user for a drone of this price range.  I have used a cheaper drone before that belonged to a friend and it was very difficult to fly.  So much I never looked into it anymore.  I decided to on the Holy Stone HS720 because I saw great reviews.  After the very first time use I was able to take it up high and fly around with no issues.  I’m no expert and was moving it slow but still I got the hang of it quickly.  The features it has are great like return to home, button to auto land, GPS, 2K Camera, follow me, and many more.  One thing I thought could be done better is the remote is not exactly ideal for holding large phones with cases as I struggled a little to make it fit.  Still don’t think its a deal breaker and I look forward to practice more with it and get better.  Also almost forgot it comes with this very good case to carry it and it all fits in there very well protected.  I have seen other drones don’t come with something like that and people are having to spend another $50-$90 for a good custom carrying case.  As a beginner and for all the fun I had with it I honestly feel like I’m flying a $1000 drone and since I’m not in need of all the other fancy features  I’m really happy with the decision I made.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LhRUz93kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LhRUz93kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LhRUz93kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hlBGi05OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hlBGi05OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hlBGi05OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uvqP0k4ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uvqP0k4ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uvqP0k4ZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+XehnlY3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+XehnlY3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+XehnlY3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFBT26MUEVSYAKNDOKAB53ZUBMFA,1572884288527,0,False

I wanted the HS170 to get the basics of flying a drone before I started to actually fly the HS720. Having both available I could learn a new skill on the little drone then try it on the bigger HS720. This is the way that I learn best and keep it cost effective. Both of these drones are exactly what I needed to get into this hobby. As my skills improve I'm going to be taking the HS720 with me when I go off-roading to plan my route over and around obstacles, view the beauty of the Arizona backcounty and to share the experience with friends and family.

1705,5.0,"Awesome drone, just what I was looking for!",I was looking for a good GPS drone that didn't cost an arm and a leg yet had a lot of the features of the more expensive drones.  After driving myself nuts looking at all the options I finally came to the conclusion I was going to purchase from Holy Stone since theirs seemed to be of good quality per user reviews and probably would have better customer support.  Fortunately I went to Holy Stone website and found this new offering from them and I ordered it right away and could not be happier.  I have flown two times now and each time I flew for 15 minutes on the slow speed setting and the battery still had charge left so I think attaining the 22 to 26 min of flying time quoted should not be an issue.  The manual is overall well written and gave me sufficient confidence before my first flight.  One thing I learned which may save people from contacting Holy Stone support is that the bottom lights for the optical sensor will not turn on unless the drone is flying.  The drone handles very well and is able to maintain position even during a slight wind.  By setting limits on distance and elevation in the app I plan to increase the allowable range as my flying skills progress.  I really like that the drone comes with a nice carrying case so I can take it on short hikes and easily pack it without fear of damage.  I have not loaded a memory card yet but the pictures stored back to the phone seem of good resolution and color and it is nice that the camera can angle down so you can get the propellers out of the image. I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a GPS drone.,[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AG3UB62243ULZE3RH2I25QKKQWQA,1568808284211,2,False

1707,5.0,"The maiden voyage of my HS 720 and as a novice, my first time operating a GPS drone.","[[VIDEOID:48fcea8b42e9c181c4df6c8ab1cd279b]] After reading several reviews, I decided to buy the HS720 as my first GPS drone because it was loaded with lots of features similar to the more expensive models but is relatively inexpensive.  I watched a few online reviews after I bought mine and before it arrived.  I immediately charged the battery.  Since the weather was bad when it arrived and I had to work, I spent 10 minutes reading through the manual.  That was enough for the Holy Stone's maiden flight in our house.  I used only the controller unit (no gps and no app) and had it take off, hover, then landed it few times.  Given the small space, I ran into some furniture and once into a wall and cringed at the buzzing sounds of propeller blades slapping into them.  The bottom line is that it survived the ordeal.<br /><br />A couple days letter, the weather got better and luckily, my micro SD card and landing pad arrived.  I plugged in the card and took my drone outside.  I went through the aligning procedure, paired the app with my drone, turned on the video and pressed the take-off button.  The process was seamless, taking less that 5 minutes to complete without a hitch.  It was so intuitive that I didn't even need to refer to the instructions.<br /><br />After letting my drone hover for a short time, I rotated it to record the low-altitude view.  I then carefully pushed up on the stick to get it maybe 15 feet into the air and made another rotation.  Then I went high enough to clear the shorter tress (70 feet according to the flight log) and did one more rotation.  Then I hit the automatic return and the drone slowly descended and landed gently on the ground.  Everything worked pretty much as I had expected and I am happy with my purchase.  Note that the video is better than what you see on this site.<br /><br />The drone landed about 10 feet from where it took off, which was a bit disappointing (I think we expect too much), and the video quality is not 4K and shaky (see my video), as one would expect from the fact that the camera is not actively stabilized.  My conclusion is that it operated as I expected and its shortcomings are reasonable given the price.  This is an excellent first drone that I will use to learn the ropes.  Once I feel comfortable with it, I plan on purchasing the HS720E so that I can get better videos.  For now, I'm looking forward to many hours of learning and fun.<br /><br />If you are a beginner looking for an excellent gateway drone, I recommend the HS720.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGNBQY5PUIZHEQ3L3CR7PFZEPN2A,1611362846910,6,True

1716,5.0,My first GPS drone,"I've had 2 cheap drones and loved flying them.  They lasted until the motors burned out and couldn't be replaced.  This is my first hobby grade drone. It flys well but I don't enjoy having to recalibrate it everytime I want to fly.  As for the different modes, I've only used the auto launch and the return to home button.  The auto launch button usually works but once it went up very quickly until I used the controller.  The return home button worked once, once it returned to hover about 10 feet away then started back up, and the last time it went the wrong way. When the RTH button sent it the wrong way it didn't respond to the controls or the rotor lock, it hit a limb and crashed.  Both of the foldable arms on the left side were broken.  I'm a beginner pilot and I'm happy with the stability, compared to my $50 and $80 drones, but not with the limited use I've gotten from the advanced features this drone offered. Now I need to find out where to buy replacement body parts because Amazon and Holy Stone doesn't list them. UPDATE. -- Holy Stone shipped a full replacement drone and it works great.  This is above and beyond what I expected. The drone is easy to fly and I look forward to learning more about it's abilities.

1721,5.0,Tough as boot leather!,"Never owned a drone, but did some research and went with the HS720. Was very happy with the packaging and case. The battery takes 5-7 hours to charge, but hopefully will have at least one spare soon. Took it for the first flight and was pleased with the controls and how it handled in the breeze that is always present at my house. I will say this thing is tough. I had a minor disagreement with a small tree branch but no damage. After taking off again, a HAWK flew out of the woods behind my house and attacked the drone. From about 50’ it hit the ground because I lost control when the hawk made contact with the drone. It landed in the field in front on my house on some rock. I was expecting the worst, but a simple power cycle and recalibration of the compass allowed me to get back in the air and I flew it to the house. Decided not to press my luck on day 1. Definitely recommend this for a beginner.<br /><br />*Update*<br />Second flight was great until the battery got low and it went to return to where I took off.... on the other side of my house. I couldn’t stop it from running in to the side of my house. Now I have two broken drone arms. Will be contacting the manufacturer for replacement parts.

1729,5.0,An Awesome Drone!,"[[VIDEOID:cd9fb75b16f516cc7b82c553f63470d6]] The Holy Stone 720 is awesome! Not only is it a compact drone packaged in a very convenient and well-appointed carry case, but it is fast and nimble.<br /><br />I’ve flown the 720 just a handful of times but have a good sense of its capabilities.<br /><br />The drone is packed in a zippered hard case with a carry handle. Inside it has cut-out foam placements for the drone, transmitter and box of accessories containing spare props, a screwdriver and charger. The case is a convenient way to transport your drone without it getting damaged.<br />Start-up procedures/steps seem more streamlined than the HS270 and HS700, so it was short order to get the 720 airborne.<br /><br />The build quality is excellent. It feels solid and well-made to the touch.<br /><br />The transmitter is small to hold, but the fold-out palm grips help and make it feel more secure in your hands. I like the LCD display which provides relevant status of all components, such as GPS satellites, battery status, height and distance. The dual antenna and smartphone mount are quite close to each other, so I struggled a little to mount the smartphone on the transmitter, but once in place it felt quite secure. If you have big hands you might find it more cumbersome.<br /><br />Flying the drone is a dream! It is the fastest of the three drones I own, and very responsive to flight control inputs. Battery time is very good, but initial charge time is long; 5-7 hours from zero charge.<br /><br />You can record first-person-view (FPV) video directly to a connected smartphone using the Ophelia app, or to an optional 32 GB TF card and then download to your PC. Video quality is good depending on the resolution of your playback device. Of course, you don’t have to record video to use first person view (FPV) in flight, and you don’t need a smartphone/Ophelia software to fly the drone visually.<br /><br />In summary, HS720 drone has great flight characteristics, it is compact and easy to transport in its case.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HasYrdwqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HasYrdwqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HasYrdwqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFS4ZKYGDRSTMMWO54X6KNQTK5BQ,1581526524791,0,True

Amazing drone, performs perfectly","If you are uncertain if this is right drone to purchase I can comfortably say this Holy Stone drone is completely worth your money!

Controls are responsive and the camera is high quality and steady.  Once you get connection with GPS satellites the drone WILL return to its launch point with very reliable precision!  My wife and I are building a new house and wanted to check out the progress from the air.  I am impressed!<br />Holy Stone should be Holy #&!%, I can't believe I spent less than $300 for this drone!

I give the Drone 5 stars for what it is, and how easy it was for me to get set up and fly. I Was even able to record and snap photos of my test flight.  I thoroughly read the instruction/owner's manual before flight.  I even went legit, and registered the drone with the FAA, as this drone is required due to it's weight (over 250 grams) It's super easy to do and it's only $5 bucks.<br /><br />You will need a micro sd card for this drone for it to perform to it's full potential.  This drone can accept a MAXIMUM of 32gb micro sd.  No larger from what I understand.  Also, you will need to purchase a 5v / 2.0a usb adapter to properly charge batteries.  *Not included*  I wish I would have known this prior to purchase.

It works well and the pitch automatically adjusts for wind. The follow me setting works well too and waypoints are accurate. It flies quite fast and does really well low to the ground. I've used other drones that do not fly well in tight spaces. This one does excellent. Once you get the hang of the controls it's quite stable and steady. Even in wind it keeps position well. It keeps altitude quite well too in wind. The video and photos are good but you would expect that from an HD camera so less impressive given the expectations but the video quality meets expectations. I was a little concerned with battery life but it actually does quite well. I can routinely get 30 min of fly time out of it. All in all I'm very pleased with this drone.

Real stable, with a little expected shake and drift from sustained wind aloft or gusts of about 10 knots. Once you practice and get orientation down you can take some very smooth video. Max range I have taken it was about 600' feet distance and 130' feet elevation. Take your time and do the calibration right, and understand the app settings. The only thing quirky is the follow me function, which I found works okay to good 50' or below, but is a tad slow adusting (follows the controller).

1747,5.0,Fun and easy to fly!,"I've been thinking about purchasing a drone for some time and finally got serious about it. After a lot of research and reading many reviews I decided on the HS720 because of its price, star rating, positive reviews and high remarks for its customer service.<br />When the drone arrived, I read the instructions and watched a couple of YouTube videos on how to fly. First flight didn't disappoint. The take off and landing assist worked great. The gps return to home feature is awesome and pictures quality is good. Battery life is more than adequate for beginners. If you're thinking about getting a drone I'd highly recommend this one. It has great features for the price.<br />Unfortunately being a novice flier,  I attempted to fly the drone in higher winds then recommend and I crashed the drone, damaging the right front arm. I emailed customer support and they responded within 24 hours, I explained to the representative (Summer) the circumstances and she send me a replacement drone. Needless to say in this day and age it seems like contacting customer service is a huge pain and it's difficult to find someone that can actually take care of your issue. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly HS addressed my problem and I was completely satisfied with the outcome.

As a previous owner of a Holy Stone HS100 (which I still have and use regularly) I was in the market for a more compact drone I could easily travel with around the country to job sites.  I searched much more expensive competitors but still came back to Holy Stone and the HS720 and I’m glad I did.  The unit is compact, cones with an included travel case, and us extremely BBC affordable line other HS products. Set up and calibration was a little more specific than the HS100 but only took about 10 min to get flight ready.  And WOW !!! Flight times were far greater than expected at about 23 minutes even with a 10 minute video of my project location. Image quality with the 4K camera was greater than I expected. Travel speed is adjustable and I spent most time at high speed.  Video is relatively stable in the breezy conditions I flew in and the range was much better than my HS100 could achieve. I piloted are about 425’ elevation with max range of about 675’ away (I’m in a terrible satellite/WiFi location) so for what I’m planning on utilizing the drone for I think it was an excellent decision to stick with Holy Stone who is not 2 for 2 on 5 star ratings on my Drone purchases.

1754,4.0,Great Drone for the price,"This is my second Holy Stone Drone that I purchased on amazon. My 1st drone was the Hs 100 which is a great drone that I purchased about two years ago and is still working perfect and now I purchased the Hs 720 which I have had for about 2 months. The HS 720 is very nimble and in my opinion the sports car of drones. It is fast and maneuvers very well and it is also a fun drone to play with and teach others to fly drones with ( I taught my 12 year old son on this drone and now he wants his own). The battery lasts about 20 minutes with continuous flying. The remote control takes batteries, instead of having to charge it which I like much better. I sometimes have trouble with the remote of the HS100 saying it is not charged when it is and it takes a little bit to register. The only complaint with the Hs 720 is the camera for me. The camera works fine to take overhead pictures when playing with it but if you are trying to focus in on some fine details, it isn't the best. Also the camera is on a shock which helps but the wind does blur the pictures sometimes. I do prefer the camera on the HS 100 over the HS 720. However, looking at the price of the drone, the quality of the drone, the fact that it flies so well, even in windy conditions, and the ease of flying this drone, it is a no brainer when it comes to purchasing this drone. I do recommend this drone and I am glad I purchased it. If you are comparing it to a very expensive drone you will be disappointed but if look at the price point and take that into account, you will be very happy with your purchase.

1759,5.0,BLUF: Great little drone for the money!,"OK - I'll start out by saying I purchased this - my first drone - and received nothing in return for writing this review. I've had it for about 2 months (it was an early Christmas present to myself) and flown it several times a week over that period. I bought it mainly to document the construction of my new house and have taken a couple hundred pictures, and a few videos to date. It's been a great tool for that purpose.<br /><br />Things I like: It's easy to fly, behaves as I expect it to, and as far as I can tell all the features and functions work as advertised. The folding feature is great, making it truly easy to transport, and the battery life is impressive. I love the well made case - I can toss it in the back of my Jeep (complete with the spare battery I purchased) when I head to the job site and not have to worry about anything getting damaged on the way.<br /><br />Things that could be better: The camera is certainly adequate for my purposes, but it's not great. I take mostly still photos, and those are fine, but video taken on anything but a dead calm day can be nauseating to watch. I understand the physics of a small, lightweight air vehicle struggling mightily to remain stable on a breezy day; it does the best it can, but don't expect Steadicam-like HD video from something in this price range. Also, for those of us used to today's cell phone cameras and modern DSLRs, 2K pixels is not what we'd call high resolution. But again, you get what you pay for, and a drone with a better camera is going to set you back several more Benjamins. Finally, as others have noted, the Ophelia App used with this drone is somewhat annoying - it takes multiple button pushes to get it up and running, and that includes answering several mysterious questions in Chinese. However it does work well once you get past that. But come on guys - you sell a boatload of these drones in the U.S. - can't you afford a few bucks to produce an English language version of the software?<br /><br />Conclusion: The above gripes notwithstanding, I'm very happy with my Holy Stone HS720. It's fun to fly and does what I bought it for. On breezy days you can tell it struggles against the wind, but that's just physics. I could have purchased a drone with a better camera, but didn't want to spend the extra money, especially given this was my first drone purchase. For what I spent I'm very pleased with this purchase.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zKyr04jZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zKyr04jZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zKyr04jZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGUBE3TTP4IN4QA46DQ3STCETYDQ,1579959995319,1,True

The camera is completely unstable and low resolution even you try to adjust. Flying with a little windy weather the dron becomes really unstable. It’s try to stay in the same place but never happen. The dron actually flew good the two first times. After that becomes imposible to fly and was broken. They send me a replacement but works in the same way. Completely unstable after a few flys. At least for me was the last time I waste my money in that dron. By what offers I could find a lot of drones for begginers with much better qualities by much less money.

1774,5.0,Great drone,"I purchased a HS720.  When I received it I was very excited to fly it.  I had purchased a drone from another company, that I had for my first one.  I thought that was the bomb.  After flying that for about 2 weeks I realized I needed a better quality drone to play with.  I didn’t want to spend a fortune, I got online and did some research and for what I wanted to spend this was one of the top choices.  Being new I had no idea good or bad so I went with it.  Glad I did very easy to fly GREAT PICS have not made any videos yet but I will.  I did have some problems on first take off and trying to land it, but I figured it out, still had plastic on lenses, guess I needed to read directions better.  Then I received an email from your company advising me not to forget to do that, I had to kinda laugh at myself.  That was another thing I thought was great, I have received a couple emails thanking me for my purchase and tips.  That is the kind of service after the sale I like.  I have not owned it very long but sure hope the customer service is there always when needed.  That brings me to another point I have, being it’s so new I fly a lot, but with only 1 battery I’m limited to one flight per day pretty much.  Again I reference my first drone, it said the flight time was 15 min, I was lucky to get 8-9 minutes.  Your drone says flight time is 26 minutes I flew it the first night for almost 25 min before I looked about empty.  That is a very good selling feature also.  ( flight time is actually what the box says). My brother wants a drone also but has to wait till Christmas his wife says, he came over and seen mine, flew it and fell in love, I think I have him sold on this one.  Looking to purchase another battery but I cannot find it on your web site.  The drone looks and feels like the expensive ones, I have never owned an expensive one but I cannot see how much better they could be next to this one.  Love the looks, the little case is a great addition, my previous sat on bench, this one I can keep contained, very nice quality in my book.  Thank you for your time,  if the battery is available let me know so I can get one please.

1785,4.0,Compact full featured GPS Drone for getting started,"I was looking for a small foldable GPS drone to carry in my 4x4 truck for use as utility and for fun.  My goal was to get a unit that small enough to hang in the ceiling net of the truck, up and away yet handy when needed.  After several hours of watching YouTube reviews (CAPTAIN DRONE) this unit stood out. The 2k camera on a 1 axis gimble and what looks like enough power to fly at higher altitudes (In the Mountains, not above more than 400ft above the surface) all packed into the folding design made this drone the right choice.<br /><br />With more than an hour of flight time, I am not disappointed.  I am looking forward to using it above 2000ft elevation in a few days and above 9000 early next year (Updates Coming). I was impressed with how quiet the unit is during flight. Above 50ft, the prop noise blends into the background here in the city.<br /><br />While not having much to compare to, the speed of charging seems slow but lets do the math to see if this is reasonable.<br /><br />Battery Basics:  The battery is listed as 7.4v, while the charger is rated for 3.7v.  This information means that the battery for this unit has 2x 3.7 Cells inside. The battery is rated for 2800mah, and because the two cells are in series to make 7.4v each of the cells has 2800mah capacity.<br /><br />Charger Basics:  The charger is rated at 3.7v with a max of 2amps.  The 2 amps charging for 1 hour provides 2000mah of capacity to reload these batteries.  While we are talking about the charger, I would like to see a more 'secure' connection between the battery and charger.  My use in a moving truck to recharge has required me to tape or secure them together to avoid unintentional disconnection.<br /><br />But wait, there is more math to this.  Because the charger uses 3.4v to charge, each of the two cells in the battery are charged in parallel, dividing the charging capacity in 1/2 (1000mah). Also, because this charger can charge 2 batteries (4 cells) at the same time but with the same max capacity...the charging rate may be a 1/4 of the listed rate (500mah).  Why is 500mah important?  Because each cell can hold 2800mah, meaning it may take 5-6 hours to recharge both batteries. So with the math...the only way to get faster charging is to update the charger and its power supply (3.1A USB-C). *Charging 1 battery is 2x faster than 2...so if you just need a quick flight, just juice up one and wait til later for the 2nd.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHFK7ZA2NYNCVQEE6NFA67YVEHWA,1573163265436,0,True

1792,5.0,HS720 Review - Great Drone,"I have flown a number of drones for a while now and most of them are hard to figure out. It seems the more you spend on them, the harder they are to figure out. I had one that I could never figure out and sent it back having never flown it. I tried videos, reading all the materials and everything I could think of and nothing. I finally stumbled on the Holy Stone 720 after researching many drones and it comes with many accessories and has good long-lasting batteries as well which is really important when trying to fly for any length of time. I had another expensive drone that took great video, but the gimbal was so open that it got damaged very easily, I had to send it in for repairs and 200 dollars later, I got it back. For about the same money, I could have gotten this Holy Stone drone which has good protection around the camera area. The other thing I did not like about a number of drones was that there was just no stop button, you had to just hold the toggles down until they decided to stop which led to a couple of accidents as well. The Holy Stone 720 is easy to figure out, to fly and takes great video and pictures. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who are newer pilots like myself that don’t want to spend what I have spent just trying to figure all of this out.

1801,1.0,Not Sure,"I got this as a Christmas gift. Took it out on a snowy day and it lifts right off the ground and then took off to the South. Trying frantically I got it down into the snow. Figured it was too cold or something. Come spring I tried again and it took off to the South again this time I saved it by hitting a tree about a 100 yards out. At this point I had to replace 2 of the 4 propellers. Come today, a nice calm evening and the piece of s#($ takes off to the South again with little response from the controller.

Second time out I was excited to lift off and didn't have all the sat. signal. and did have to chase it a bit when the wind kinda panicked me and it got away about 100 yards.

1803,5.0,"Great drone, nice case, easy to fly","This is my first ""real"" drone. In the past I had got my kids the toy versions which were actually harder to use and less responsive than this drone. This drone is great! I particularly love the case that it comes in and how compact it is. Makes it easy to take anywhere and can worry less about damaging it in transport. The flying capabilities/functions are very easy to pick up, even for a beginner. The camera is also fantastic and takes some rather incredible footage. Very fun toy! One thing that I would like changed is the ability to turn OFF the ""Return to Home"" function. I see an issue with that if I'm going to be going around obstacles or take it on a long ride. I don't want it to suddenly try to go home if home is a mile away or something... and thus try to fly through trees or buildings, since it's line-of-sight. In the meantime, I just have to pay close attention to the battery level and shut it down before it gets to that point.  Instead of ""Return to Home"" perhaps ""Return to Ground"" would be safer/better. Otherwise, it's a great little toy and I look forward to Spring and Summer when I can use it more.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFXWESNUIPUJEON54OZLGAHS7GLQ,1583418813774,0,True
1804,5.0,Would highly recommend even for newbie,"Love this drone. I am pretty new to flying but it's pretty steady and not too hard to learn.

Return home works fairly well just know if it's windy and you are flying low when you hit return home it goes high before returning to the take off place. I had to manually take control back because the wind unexpectedly picked up n I thought I may loose her in the winds. Too many obstacles close.

My first flight was a bumpy ride of my being a bit afraid that I would lose it.  The second flight, I was buzzing all over the place going out about 200 meters and flying around our lake..  and chasing a bird >.>  &lt;.&lt;  The flight time was perfect... I walked in each time I flew it, very satisfied with the 25 minutes and eager to fly it again.  The next day though... a STRONG breeze came out of nowhere and knocked it HARD against the side of my house and broke an arm.  *insert sad face here*  The funny thing was that about 12 hours later I was flying again ...  I used gorilla glue, let it sit overnight and the next morning you would never know that the arm had snapped clear off.  ( did reach out to Holy Stone ....but I have not heard back from them yet)<br /><br />the TLDR: - This drone is well worth the $$ - it is very easy to pick up and learn.

1866,2.0,Could be an outstanding quadcopter except for - - -,"I have used this aircraft since November of 2019 and I now have enough experience with it to provide a comprehensive review.<br /><br />This quadcopter has the potential to be a fantastic machine. If it was not for its occasional un-commanded and destructive “flights of fancy” I would have given it fully 5-stars with no exceptions or reservations. Sadly, it has a very bad flaw somewhere in its software that can, and did, result in uncontrolled flight ending in violent and destructive crashes.<br /><br />First the good parts.<br /><br />I purchased this aircraft primarily because I needed to inspect my roof after some very bad weather events. I had previously been playing with an inexpensive quadcopter from a well known manufacturer so I had a pretty good idea about how to fly these things. However this inexpensive quadcopter was not stable enough to perform close up inspections and photography in even mildly turbulent wind conditions. Reviewing on-line reviews of better quality quadcopters I discovered that this HS720 quadcopter was very highly regarded. Its performance did in fact live up to the best description and comments of various reviewers. In a high and very turbulent wind it is tremendously stable and as a photo platform it is outstanding. I was able to maneuver it closely, within a few feet, around objects in winds gusting to 25kts according to the NWS at my local airport. Its station keeping performance is outstanding. It required minimal control inputs form the remote controller to get the HS720 positioned and keep it there.<br /><br />For general flying I have taken it out to a large undeveloped open site to see what it could do. It will do, and do well, everything (almost) it is advertized to do. Its ability to “follow me” is spooky good. It will orbit in its assigned point maintaining the assigned elevation until commanded to be brought back or the battery limit are exceeded. It always goes back to its launch point or as commanded by me. I flew it well out of visual range and tested its ability to “return to home” by pressing the RTH button or with the controller shut off indicating loss of signal and after being airborne until its battery was exhausted. It always returned to within three feet of its launch point. The Ophelia app for the smart phone is very good, The only down side of the Ophelia app is that it runs out of WiFi signal way before the controller signal runs out<br /><br />In almost every respect it is an outstanding flying machine. Furthermore, the Holy Stone customer support is fast, responsive and generally excellent.<br /><br />Now the not so good part.<br /><br />If the HS720 is flown in the “TapFly” mode, pre-programmed to fly a path, it will do so, and quite nicely too. The problem is that some times, and unpredictably, the next flight immediately after the “TapFly” flight will be totally uncontrolled - what I noted above as its “flight of fancy”.<br /><br />I have two HS720 quadcopters and both have been destroyed in uncontrolled flight.<br /><br />The first time this happened it was after I brought the HS720 back from a “TapFly” flight. I shut it down and removed the photo SD card. I restarted the quadcopter and attempted to launch for a manual flight. As soon as the “take off/landing” button was pushed the quadcopter immediately climbed to no more than two feet and made a hard right turn and flew into the tire of a nearby car. The quadcopter seemed to be unresponsive to control commands but the flight lasted well less than 10 seconds. There was no damage other than some scrapes on the fuselage and dings on one of the props. I powered down the quadcopter and again performed a complete restart procedure.  I flew the quadcopter many time after that incident, including some “TapFly” flights and all went well.  On its final flight, again after a “TapFly” flight, I launched the quadcopter for a manual flight. As soon as the “take off/landing” button was pushed the quadcopter immediately made a 180 degree climbing right turn to about two feet and accelerated hard for about 75 feet when it collided at full speed with a steel bollard. Parts went flying. The quadcopter was destroyed. The quadcopter seemed unresponsive to any control command but the flight lasted less than 15 seconds.<br /><br />I contacted Holy Stone customer support to enquire into repairing the quadcopter. I told my sad tail was informed that repairs are not possible but I was offered a fair discount on a replacement HS720. I took the offer. I was also provided with instructions about the correct practices for operating the quadcopter to avoid the same issue in the future. As it happened I was already carefully  following these procedures.<br /><br />I flew my second HS720 for a few months in all modes of flight, including the “TapFly” pre-programmed flight mode. On a couple of occasions after a “TapFly” flight it started to enter an uncontrolled flight but I was able to ground the quadcopter without incident. On the final flight of my second HS720, again, after a “TapFly” flight, I restarted the quadcopter, following all the procedures, for a manual flight. As soon as the “take off/landing” button was pushed the quadcopter immediately climbed and went into a left turn heading into trees and a fence. The quadcopter was not responsive to directional controls but I managed to get it to climb so I could avoid objects and see it. It did not respond to the “return to home” command and continued to fly erratically away from the launch point. When it was over open ground I used the descend command on the joystick to try to bring it down but lost sight of it. When I finally found it the quadcopter was on the ground about 500 feet from the launch point with a broken left rear arm. It was close to a fence and it may have collided with the fence.<br /><br />My suspicion is that this is due to a software bug somewhere.<br /><br />So my review of the HS720 performance is as follows. As a camera platform it is very good. It is very stable in the air even in heavy gusts turbulence and its station keeping ability is excellent even in heavy wind. The quadcopter performs very well in all flight modes. The battery life is good, I was getting well over 20 minuets. The protection function for loss of signal and low battery perform exactly as advertized, it will always come home.  The Ophelia app is very useable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the “TapFly” function appears to leave the flight control computer in an unstable condition under unpredictable circumstances which can result in later uncontrolled flight.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a really nice quadcopter and if all I wanted to do is take photos under direct manual control I would get another one.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AE75PAZYCSDGYZMSOU7FLFUERAYQ,1588733686201,41,True

I like this drone A LOT!! In fact it is a BEAST! I have, not intentionally,  put this drone through the ringer and it keeps on going! I have flown it into concrete walls, crashed into walls in my house, flown it into countless bushes/shrubs, and have even crashed it into a river where it sat in 3ft of moving water for about 10 mins and, after definite drying efforts, it still operates 100% normally.  I got soo lucky!!  Point being, it has taken quite the unintentional abuse by me and has given me the slightest issue.<br />I have to say though, the one and only reason I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the unsteadiness of the video quality.  It is pretty clear, no complaints there, but it is pretty rocky and it definitely picks up wind movement.<br />Again, a great 1st drone to learn or orientate yourself with flying, and also incredibly durable.

1880,5.0,Gives DJI a run for their money!,"I'm extremely delighted with the HS720's performance, durability, and clever design. Very easy setup and operation had me flying in minutes. I find the drone's operating range is slightly better when paired the transmitter from the HS700D and you are still able to control the camera gimbal with this controller. The foldable transmitter with the HS720 is very capable of transmission of at least 3700 feet, and is very aesthetically pleasing with it's illuminated LED. The camera video quality is fantastic. No ""jello"" effect from vibration and the 2k resolution is much more crisp. I LOVE the visual ground sensor as I can now easily take some amazing low flying Star Wars like ""Speeder Bike"" videos.

Camera is pretty great. Very clear. You can see blades in video if it's all the way at the top but you can adjust out of the picture by tilting it down.<br />3. Great for first time user. On my third short flight, I ran into a tree. The propellers stopped and it dropped about ten feet only to stabilize and and hover in place. There is no way I could have leveled out on my own but whatever internal functioning occurred, it had saved it.<br />4. All around pretty great!<br /><br />Cons:  Most of the cons so far are to be expected or generally related to any drone.<br />1. Easily affected by wind.<br />2.  Follow me appears to require a certain distance. I tried to use and instead of following me it moved away almost hitting a tree and my house so I recommend using in a wide open space at first.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFKURVASYO4E4CB5SQ7J3ZSXJ47A,1598632673893,0,True

I really enjoy flying the drone and overall it is very stable (I have yet to fly in high winds).  If everything worked properly, I would give the drone 4 stars.  I am subtracting an extra star due to the lack of documentation, features not working properly, and the camera quality not being quite what was advertised (see picture).<br /><br />UPDATE:  Holy Stone has great customer service and sent me a new drone to try out without me asking.  The drone works great and is working properly.  I would highly recommend this drone as a great practice or starter drone.<br />The features that are not working on my drone are as follows: the SD card gives errors when recording video and the follow me feature doesn't work.  Follow me worked the first time I used it, but has stopped working on subsequent flights.<br /><br />The instruction manual is lacking and there is little to no information about the use of the SD card.  It is important to know that you need to download all of our pictures and video to your phone before shutting down the drone after a flight otherwise nothing is saved on the card.  The images that the camera does take are ok but not great, so if you want to use this for pictures or videos this isn't the drone for you.  For the price I wasn't expecting a great camera, but I also don't think it lives up to what was advertised.<br /><br />Also be aware that if you want to purchase spare props, they haven't been released at the time this review was written.<br /><br />For the price, I think this is a great training drone and I would recommend purchasing it if you know what to expect.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JN341T2FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JN341T2FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JN341T2FL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEYON5BWXFEYIQBFLDFRIAE4LIRA,1577400526034,1,True

Battery last over 20 min and drone is responsive<br />The HS720 drone can experience excessive drift both horizontally and vertically. When flying in cluttered non-open areas, constant operator attention and correction is needed to keep drone from flying into obstacles.  Maintain 15 feet from obstacles.<br />Some issues with loss of FPV video link between drone and smartphone.  Use controller fold out handles and keep controller in an upright position for improved range performance and to reduce link dropouts.  This works well for me.<br />Camera Performance:<br />Good camera value for cost and has acceptable performance<br />The camera easily becomes saturated. Color saturation varies greatly depending on direction of sunlight.<br />Camera photos and video tend to be a little dark and lacking vibrancy.<br />Camera can go off mechanical track when over extended<br />At least on my HS720, camera sometimes needs to be manually put back into gear track to regain angle adjustment capability<br />The HS720 Drone is rugged and durable which makes it crash survivable.<br />I have experienced two crashes due to Polygon Flight Feature<br />Let me explain: When initially trying this feature, I drew a polygon on map and submitted flight path.  The drone immediately flew straight for a tree and crashed.  I tried again in an open area and the same thing happened. I figured out that this was an operator error because I initiated a polygon path at a location that began away from where the drone was located.  The drone flew a straight path towards the starting point in the polygon as designed.<br />Solution and caution when using the Polygon Flight Feature<br />Start your polygon at the current position of the drone.<br />Start this feature far away from and above obstacles<br />Remember that this drone has no obstacle avoidance<br />Initial Experience:<br />HS720 drone camera quit working after third flight<br />Got drone replaced through Amazon<br />On 12-2-19, Holystone offered to expedite a spare battery for my inconvenience<br />The first battery got lost in the mail and Holystone sent a second battery<br />On 12-31-19, I received the Spare battery from Holystone as promised",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFB6TG7PZVDRZNYNTH25H2DXVUTA,1575170653680,0,True

1927,5.0,Really liking this product!,"We purchased this after having a cheaper GPS drone for a couple years.  This drone includes some nice features that come on the much more expensive drones.  It is so convenient that it folds up and goes in the small case.  it's very durable.  The battery lasts over 20 minutes and we get pretty good video.  it's really easy to get it calibrated and into the air for flying fun!  The controller is very simple, with only a few buttons--however, I do wish that it was rechargeable and also that the controls lit up.  In the evening, it's hard to see and you don't want to push the emergency stop instead of return home.  Not a problem when you are used to the controller.  Also, I wish there was some more work put into the app (which doesn't come with this), but it does some cool things, but it fails to connect quite often, looses connection, and doesn't really say what the error is when you try something that isn't allowed.<br />  However, if the drone loses connection with the transmitter, it comes right back, so that is more of something that would be nice.  The drone has two speed modes that are switchable from the transmitter while in flight, so that is handy.  The battery has a real nice flight time (over 20 minutes) but it does take several hours to recharge, so it's worth having the extra battery or two.<br />  Very happy with this drone.  It's very fun and has several features that you'd see in a more expensive product..but simplified enough that a beginner or someone more experienced can enjoy a flight!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGRPXYMVTDFRIB2CYH2F6CKVIVSQ,1576534267762,0,True

1933,4.0,Great Starter Drone with one HUGE design flaw,"What can be said that hasn't already been said, except that I didn't see the one TERRIBLY FRUSTRATING thing about it the reviews I read (I confess I didn't read them all...)  Here it is:  The spring mount for your phone absolutely WILL NOT HOLD ANY OF THE FOUR PHONES I TRIED to use in it.  I use an Iphone 6 plus, but I tried a standard  Iphone 6,  a standard Iphone X, an Iphone 4, and an LG (whatever) that I had sitting in a drawer.  Aaaand here's what happens:  As soon as you get the phone into the cradle, the tension from the mount immediately pops the phone out.  Not only that, but because there are two dials and two fairly critical buttons on top of the remote, the phone makes them fairly inaccessible, so if by some miracle of physics, you DO manage to get the phone to hold for a few seconds, the tension between the edges of the phone (which typically have buttons like ""on/off"" and ""volume"" are depressed, and when you go to tilt the camera or take a picture, you invariably just pop the phone out again.  I called Holy Stone about this, and their customer service just gave me an ""Oh well...  Yeah, that happens.  We hear it a lot."" and then recommended I purchase an Anbee Foldable extender at the cost of 17 bucks, which they were absolutely NOT WILLING TO PAY FOR.  And is back ordered until at least mid June.  I ended up putting a one inch square of Velcro tape on the back of my phone and another one on the bracket, which kinda works, sort of sometimes, but it's still irritating as all hell for obvious reasons.  I can't understand how a company which makes such an awesome little flying robot could frack up this bad on what should have been easily caught in product testing, corrected before going to market, or at least offered to offset the cost of the only thing that apparently will make it work properly.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AHTPFOZX2MAQTZ2JXT7B3QAWVP2A,1589556351053,2,True

1969,5.0,Great travel drone for beginner to intermediate.,"After having a beginner drone and spending more time fishing it of trees than actual fly time, this drone is a dream.  The camera is high quality.  It handled cross winds great at above 5 to 10 feet.  I pushed it to its limits to see how far I could get it and it performed well. The control seems to have a better connectivity than the 5g video to a phone, so I would suggest for farther trips with video get an sd card.  The auto fly features produces much better video than manual control.  I have had issues with the spin calibration initialization to get the compass set.  So it takes some time to get to fly time.  I have not pushed the limits of the battery, but I would be concerned if the battery got low and it would descend in time for a  return to home safe landing.  Without a headless mode it takes some head work to understand the correct orientation.  Overall its a great compact little drone which lives in a nice case.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AEQH6RBHXAMVBUYHTSD76U4DUVFA,1572117279319,1,True

I always had to manually set the white balance before I fly depending on the weather to get seemingly good picture quality but I couldn’t get over the shaky video recording. The Image stabilization claimed is not really stable for professional or even recreational video recording.

2024,5.0,This Drone is Cool!!,"I've had a couple of lower end drones before so I was excited when I received my HS720....this is one being one of the upper end models from Holy Stone.  I did a fair amount of research before choosing this model, thinking it would be the right combination of ease of use, durability, price vs. value and company reputation.  I wanted a foldable wing version this time.<br /><br />Straight out of the box this drone seems to be well constructed, compact and feature laden.  Love the carrying case and because the this is a folding wing drone the case is very small and makes it easy to tote around and take with you.<br /><br />Set up was straight forward and it was easy to get flying very quickly.  I recommend thoroughly reading the flight manual and getting familiar with all the controls and features.....<br /><br />I opted for the automatic features initially....auto hover, return to home, safe return, etc. before diving into some of the more ""daring"" things.  Tried a few photos and a short video....jury's still out on how well these will turn out.  I've learned from my other drones to take my time and practice flying these thing so you don't crash and break on the first day.<br /><br />Overall this drone seems like it'll be a good upgrade from my other ones....being easier to fly and more feature driven.<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase thus....far.

Very important to make sure you calibrate the internal compass correctly--3 full turns etc.. When this is not set right drone will drift and controls become unresponsive.  ( all this is is the well put together manual )  Make sure you test it out by keeping it close by before flying further.

This was not the case I am super pumped on how easy it was to fly. There really is isn’t any way you could crash it if you start to lose control just let go and it holdS position. Auto take off and return to home take away the chances of crashing. Arial photos and videos are legit. My first flight started at 4:45 and I landed at 5:12 so the flight time was very satisfying.

2038,5.0,Great Drone and Great Customer Service,"First, the Drone itself is great, especially for the price. It handles well, and responds to controls seemingly immediately, which is a must for an object that flies through the air with the power and speed contained on this drone. The only limiting factor is the connection with my phone, which starts losing visual connection well before the remote itself loses connection. The drone maintains its position splendidly. The GPS features are quite handy. I do wish the follow me feature enabled the drone to follow at a closer distance, however, I think that would be a huge safety risk as well, so I cannot count that against it. The orbit mode is also great whether you are photographing your family in the park and flying above houses capturing the full beauty of the sunset.<br /><br />Second, the customer service. This is the real selling point for me. The customer service for the drone is spectacular. The company sincerely cares about the experience consumers have with the product and responds quickly to resolve any issues or concerns they have.

2110,4.0,Easy To Use - Great Even After Some Crashes,"[[VIDEOID:23da3889e7c7498a92a42b2fc422a18e]] Disclaimer; I won this as part of a work contest.<br />- Overall I am quite happy with this little drone.  Being the first drone that I have owned (I've owned RC helicopters before), this was a great experience and has done well for me.<br />- The ease of being able to pop it up into the air was very nice and made it so I didn't have to worry about stabilizing it too much.<br />- I LOVE the return to home feature!  If I want to get an awesome shot somewhere that can be a bit trick to reach, I can just send the drone off in the distance and let the return to home take over from there to bring it back.<br />- Also the point-to-point feature is awesome.  Just make sure you are above trees/etc so you know it will come back to you.<br />- One thing I am not a fan of is the follow me function.  I went for a hike and it would follow for a moment but then stop.  Then it would follow again and stop.  This leaves the camera in a bouncing state due to the start/stop action of following me.  It is possibly due to the controller beeping at me about low batteries but I don't think that would have impacted it.<br />- The only other thing that concerns me is that on multiple occasions when I am trying to land it, it will act like it forgot its left/right trim setting and glide away from me.  More than once I've had real concerns about hitting people around me as I try to land it.<br />- I've attached a video of some recorded footage.  Not as great as drones costing over a thousand dollars but still some good footage.  It can get a bit wobbly if there is wind that the drone is trying to counter but the video works for my purposes.<br />- I've managed to crash this thing a handful of times and it keeps on working great though.

2133,5.0,A very good drone for the price,"After several days of on and off research and debating with my son (who I got this for) we ultimately decided on this model.  This appears to be HolyStone's top model and is a very good ""bang for the buck"".<br /><br />Observations:<br />1) This unit has an instruction manual and quickstart guide. I recommend you read both before use.<br />2) This drone feels heavy considering its size (I mean this in a good way) and is made of high quality impact plastic.<br />3) It comes with three sets of replacement blades and a decent case, as advertised.<br />4) The unit folds easily and all the components fit well in the case, which has space for an extra battery.<br />5) The motors have 4 small slits on the top for heat dissipation and reduce the potential for water and/or dust to get in.<br />6) It can move very quickly.  The 30 MPH speed potential does not appear to be an exaggeration.<br />7) The battery life on the drone is easy to see both on the back of the drone itself (up to 4 lights on the back of the battery) and the remote.<br />8) The remote also has a display for its battery life.<br /><br />What we liked:<br />1) the interference potential on this drone appears to be low.  My son used this drone, which operates on a 2.4GHZ frequency, at the same time two of his friends used other, different, more expensive drones that operate on the same frequency.  None of the drones interfered with each other.<br />2) The battery has a duration that appears to runs as advertised, providing there is no wind.<br />3) Video quality is good, considering the price point<br />4) Good safety features: emergency off, variable speed control and ""electric fence"".<br />5) The remote allows for accurate control, has an easy to read display and is reasonably easy to use.<br />6) It's black, which makes it easier to see in daylight while airborne compared to silver, metallic and/or white drone models.<br /><br />What could use improvement:<br />1) This drone has to be calibrated every time it is powered on with three horizontal rotations on the ground and three rotations while being held vertical.  It would be better if this was not needed except, perhaps, after firmware updates.<br />2) The remote control unit beeps a lot, which can be annoying and distracting at times.  It would be great to have software/firmware updates to control the conditions under which the remote control unit beeps.<br /><br />This is my son's second drone.  The first one we got two years ago (also a Holystone, but priced around $80) decided to fly away on its first use on Christmas day, completely unresponsive to to the remote.  We never found it and my son was in tears over the loss, but Amazon did promptly refund the purchase.  I was wary of another purchase, but from a lot of reading saw that even the $1000 drones can suffer from this problem and, in any event, this was hasn't (so far) and it does have a built-in GPS.<br /><br />All things considered, based on what I've seen so far, my son and I are happy with this purchase.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717gRxDm+ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717gRxDm+ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717gRxDm+ML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bhmr8CpQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bhmr8CpQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bhmr8CpQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bpg0EhoUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bpg0EhoUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bpg0EhoUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71irvEoYmUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71irvEoYmUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71irvEoYmUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YLrylpgNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YLrylpgNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YLrylpgNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGNZUL6V5PCOFYHVRASHZHZLOIUQ,1579490416757,0,True

2140,5.0,This drone will have you flying in no time.,"I'm a first time drone buyer and user with no previous experience, so I don't have anything to compare to it. Except when I ordered the 720 I did read up and got advice saying that I should practice with a cheaper model that I would not be as afraid to risk breaking. So I bought a Bolt Bee HS150 and flew it first a little, before the HS720. That's the extent of experience I have to go on.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly impressed with the 720 and its handling capabilities! It was easy to setup. I even used it to look in my tree for my wayward Bolt Bee, which had ""raced"" it's way previously into the tree (not till after I bought it did I learn that the HS150 is considered not only a beginner's drone, but also a racing drone, being very fast indeed, lol).<br /><br />On my first day out flying the 720 I was able to record some short videos  and pictures with the drone. I even posted a short video on Facebook, and it got liked, too!<br /><br />I'm having a lot of fun with this unit. I can wholeheartedly recommend this drone. I'll be glad when I get another battery so I can fly longer, as the recharge time on these batteries pretty much ends the days fun. That's the only weakness I found in the HS720.<br />The whole thing stores in a compact case that comes with it. A totally cool bonus!

Its a substantial drone when opened but folds down to a very compact unit and fits in the very rugged and handy case.

The video recording is very respectable, we have already gotten alot of great footage and obviously so much potential for great projects. The controls and phone based UI also are very straight forward and so far perfectly reliable. It's is all around sweet.

2171,5.0,Drone flew off and disappeared.,"Update 6/10/20<br />So I was able to contact holystone. Their customer service was awesome. After telling them my story, they decided to send me a whole setup again. Which was awesome. I was really surprised by that. So it’s supposed to arrive Friday.<br />I did in the meantime have my dad come over to help me search for my drone. Miraculously my dad found it somehow today.  It was laying in the field next to my field near the fence row. It was laying upside down and the top shell was cracked. I was able to turn it on and then it turned right back off. So something Is wrong With it internally. Contacted holystone again to see what they want to do work the damaged drone. Not sure if they will want it back so they can perform an analysis on it to see what happened. I would buy this drone again solely based on the customer service. I think going forward before she flys again, I’m going to invest in a fpv camera and goggles. That way if it goes down again I will be able to locate it based on the area I’m flying again.plus you can record with most fpv goggles. The built in wireless fpv for your drone is not that great. I’ve only been able to get it out to 250 meters or so with no obstructions. I mean it’s not bad. But the drone controller has the capability to reach 1000 meters. I wished this was one was built more likely the DJI drones to where the app/phone connects to the controller instead of the camera on the drone. If it were to send the signal to the controller and then to the app, you could fly out further. I’ve seen most of the DJI drones fpv on app can reach 1km and the controller itself is 2km. The other thing I wished holystone would do is to have a internal gps locator built in to it in case it crashed you could locate it. That or add in a crash detection system to the drone such as a loud beeping sound or flashing lights to help locate it. Other than that, I would recommend this drone and that’s why i am rating it to 5 stars now based on their great customer service.<br /><br />6/6/20<br />I will write a updated review on this once I hear back from holystone.<br /><br />But for now giving it one star. Drone was nicely packaged. Charged the battery and setup it up on a Thursday. Was able to fly it Thursday and Friday.no problems. I’m writing this today as it’s Saturday. The third day took it out on a flight. Got some nice video of some cows. Brought it back home after about 10 mins of Flight time. . Then took it back up for some more Arial shots. Got it out to 251 meters in my field and then my app lost connection and I lost video. No trees. It’s a wide open field. Then all of a sudden the controller started beeping and haven’t seen it since. I selected the return to home feature. It never came back. I have no idea what happened. Not sure if Jesus took it home with him or what. I’m going to do some more searching tomorrow. It sucks that this drone with all its features doesn’t have a locator on it. The app was no help as it didn’t even record my last flight. I’ve email holystone to see what they can do. Hopefully their customer support will Help me Out with a refund or a replacement.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGVCCGYWXR3CNZYYW3RSOK6UMOXA,1591498508927,2,True

I was so excited, it was my first time flying a drone. Yes as you read. It is my first time, I'm a rookie on drones and I couldn't mess up because I practically live under high power lines. I read the instructions but I felt as if it should be more to know, It can't be that easy, can it? I was so excited but nervous too. I got brave and said to myself, ""this is it! Go for it!"" As I hit the quick take off button and there it was, hoovering right in front of my eyes, so smooth, so steady and solid I've tried to pull it away from it's set spot and it fought me hard returning to the spot he was. I played with it, I was so happy with it. The GPS was on and I was able to see that there were 12 satellites above me. It was so easy to fly, I wasn't afraid anymore and I was having fun enjoying the drone time flew buy so quick before I knew the battery was low. Get the second, third or fourth battery if you can afford it cause you are going to want to stay up there with it. It is easy to learn, easy enough for beginners like me and I'm an old beginner. The remote control with my cell attach makes it so easy to control and the view on the screen from the 4k camera is unbelievable. I'm so glad I bought it. I had no accidents, I felt under control. I took it far away, high up and back down. Sorry I posted onlya short part of the movie but I was having trouble uploading the video. Something with my cell data provider not the drone.

It took me a while to get started with it because the weather conditions wouldn't cooperate - windy, snow on the ground, etc.<br />When I finally got at it seriously, I had a problem getting the camera feed to show on my cell phone.  I emailed Holy Stone Customer Support and the service was amazing!  They replied within a day and stayed with me until the issue was resolved.  (BTW: make sure you don't have a WiFi switching app active.  It might cause you to lose the connection between the drone camera and your phone.)<br />Using the HS720 is quite intuitive, once you have studied, and followed, the instructions.  The response to the controls is very good, as is the picture quality.<br />I have not yet tried all the features, but am impressed with the Return to Home function.  Wherever the drone is when you push that button it immediately climbs to 100ft+ in order to clear trees, etc (scary the first time it happens!), then positions itself over the Home spot and slowly descends to land at the place from which it took off.<br />In addition, the unit is quite robust.  I have accidentally crashed it into a bird feeder, a tree and some rocks in our landscaping and the unit came out fine.<br />I would highly recommend the HS720.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGLG4IKHGNRWSBSJB7R6SWMOWHHQ,1601465710329,0,False

Go ahead and buy it.<br />Just one suggestion. Make sure you practice over an uninhabited area for as long as it takes to feel comfortable.

2252,5.0,"Very easy to fly, smooth controls, amazing camera","[[VIDEOID:b15c3a3d2fe663a3f00effdef9bb3231]] My wife bought me the HS720 drone for my birthday and I was as excited as a little kid on Christmas. Not bad for a 40+ year old man. I have owned lesser expensive ""toy"" drones before, but they typically did not last more than a day or two before breaking. My first impression was the great packaging with the compact design, carrying case, and step-by-step setup instructions.<br />I have only flown this drone about 5 times, twice outdoors and three times inside a large warehouse. (it was raining and I really wanted to fly). The features of the Ophelia app and the functionality is top notch.<br />Today I flew it around my pool in a steady wind with occasional gusts and could not believe how incredibly stable this thing is. If your hands get tired, you can let go of the controls and the drone just hovers until you take control again. The image stability is pretty good, but there is occasional lag if you move the drone too fast (panning shots), and when the battery gets low, the video can become a little pixelated, but it is not bad. Speaking of low battery, the return to home function if you batteries get low is fantastic! The one-touch take off and landing functions are equally nice and take some of the risk out of crashing. I tested the return to home feature today and took the drone about 150 feet up and over my neighbors house (vacant at the moment), pressed the return to home button on the app control and the drone landed within about 8 inches of where it took off. The battery life is pretty close to advertised, but again, i was fighting wind, and taking the drone on high speed fly-by's to hone my skills and test the functions of the drone, so I got just shy of 20 minutes flight time on a full charge.<br /><br />In short, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to get an easy to fly, and user friendly drone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6132zJ90nyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6132zJ90nyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6132zJ90nyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717aYB5T6SL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717aYB5T6SL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717aYB5T6SL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFJPJHLWEE24AQTQMHVDWTE5RQRA,1579048973564,0,True

What a picture. I must be doing something right because there is no jello in the image. No it's not me it's the drone. After charging to make sure it was at full capacity, I watched the clock and sure enough, I got plenty of time to fly. Once you start flying you want more juice. Hope they come out with a way to purchase more batteries. Surprise is that the charger can charge 2 at the same time. Most of my time was making sure it all checked out. Gps lock was good and with a light wind it still took some great video and pics.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting some good footage of the Idaho mountains with this beauty. No regrets.

What I mean by that is that right after take off, the machine does not respond to the controller, and flies off in unpredictable directions that always end with a crash.  Initially I thought that was due to not having good contact with enough gps satellites.  I no longer believe that is the case, and I am not sure why this is happening.  But it has survived all of these crashes, even though some of them where pretty hard.  Absolutely no negative issues other than that, and it has performed really well and taken great pics.

2300,5.0,"Slick, economical hobby drone!","With a special offer, I got this as a replacement for another Holy Stone, HS120D, which is also a nice drone.  But for not much more $$, the HS720 4K is a HUGE upgrade!  Part of that is the 4K itself, but in general it’s a great UAV.  It handles very smoothly, has pretty long flight times on a single charge (an actual 30 minutes, as opposed to a “theoretical” 30 minutes), and maintains a strong, reasonable distance range connection to the controller and phone app (my prior economy drones did not).  Though not connected via a gimbal, the camera has nice, smooth range of motion with all but if not complete 0-90 degree adjustment angle.  The “least convenient” aspect is that the drone rests flat on the ground (as many folding drones do, of course), not ideal for anything other than flat pavement or a landing pad; however, for little expense, you can add bottom clip-on landing gear to compensate for that.

Using it through the controller or through the cellphone (if you download their app) is also quite simple. If you are a beginner, I would start with something like it since you will eventually crash, before going for something more expensive.<br />After a while, I had a problem with my controller and contacted Holy Stone's customer service. They had a WhatsApp customer service that was quite efficient and ended up replacing my controller. So I'm really happy with it. Buying on Amazon gives you these kinds of perks in case you need assistance.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EEYEuSDqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EEYEuSDqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EEYEuSDqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFQ73RT3J7ZBVGWFT574LAOGVDJA,1684720811657,1,True

2303,4.0,Drone has many nice feature and good customer support,"This drone has a lot of great features include a high-resolution camera and the ability to use GPS receivers.  While I am pretty competent at using computers and other technology, I am a novice drone operator. It took me a while to get the drone set up, partly because the indicator lights are on the bottom of the drone arms, and so you can only see their reflection from above.  I initially had some difficulty in getting the WiFi connection between my phone and the drone, but once it was connected, it seemed fairly stable.  At this point, I am still evaluating the ""Return to Home"" function.  This function is supposed to return the drone to its starting point. However, my one attempt to evaluate this function resulted in the drone flying way off course at high speed and crashing into a tree, thereby breaking one of the drone arms.  Fortunately, the Holy Stone customer support has been excellent, and they are sending me a replacement arm for free withing the next 3-4 weeks.  Once I can repair the drone using their instructional video, I hope to be able to provide a fuller review.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFCRU34MSSFD4CPV37GW7224VSAQ,1688090019336,0,False

2321,1.0,Frustrated with Short Battery Life on Drone Purchase,"I recently purchased a drone from this company, excited to explore the world of beginner aerial photography. However, my experience has been marred by the disappointingly short battery life of the drone.<br /><br />The advertised specifications boasted a decent flight time, but in reality, the drone barely lasts a few minutes before requiring a recharge. This severely limits the potential of capturing captivating footage or enjoying extended flight sessions, I expected at least 20-25 min PER BATTERY, however, it does not even give me enough time to drive out somewhere and use it. It feels like a constant race against time, constantly swapping batteries and missing out on valuable moments.<br /><br />I have taken utmost care to ensure proper charging and followed all recommended practices to maximize battery life. Despite these efforts and despite the fact that this started happening as soon as the first use after a 5 Hr initial charging session! The drone's battery performance falls far short of expectations. It is frustrating to invest in a product that promises versatility and endurance, only to be hindered by its limited power supply. I should’ve bought the 40$ one.<br /><br />Furthermore, when I reached out to to express my concerns, the customer service response was unsatisfactory. Based on my research and conversations with other drone owners, this level of performance is far from acceptable.<br /><br />As a consumer, I expect the products I purchase to deliver on their advertised features. A drone with such a short battery life severely hampers its usability and diminishes the overall experience. It is disheartening to have my enthusiasm dampened by this flaw, which should have been addressed during the design and testing stages.<br /><br />I hope that this seller takes this feedback seriously and strives to rectify this issue. Potential customers should be aware of the drone's limited battery life and consider alternative options that offer longer flight times. For those seeking a reliable and enduring drone experience, I would advise looking elsewhere until this seller addresses this significant drawback.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFQ5TNJKASIKQMRCSVVEW6ELBYMQ,1688763925430,0,False

2348,4.0,Finally a portable drone with carrying case,I have been pretty impressed with the HS720D.  Its quick – responsive – portable – and finally a holy drone that comes with at freaking portable case!  The controller runs off regular ole AA’s; and the battery charges in a little portable cradle instead of micro USB like some of the older Holy Stone Drones. The camera is built into the nose of this model – so you do see the props in the picture when at zero degree.  One little nuisance I’ve notice is that my camera will get a “wavey” affect to the video every so often.  It’s almost like it’s getting some air turbulence off the props.  It doesn’t do it all the time – but it is noticeable when it does.  The LED’s are the standard red / green configuration and tucked nicely into the folding arms.  They are not as easy to see from a distance – but there is a bright white light on the bottom that can be turned on and off that is very easy to see.  The distance on the  HS720 is impressive – even in wifi congested suburbia.  And when you take it out to the country – you can easily get 500 foot altitude.  One concern I do have is I have noticed some wearing in the wire boots at the pivot points of the folding arms – the wire itself is fine – but the boot is definitely showing wear after just a handful of uses.  This is actually my 2nd HS720 – as I had issues with the initial one – but Holy Stone customer support stepped up and immediately took care of the issues for me.  The controller is a bit compact for my taste – but the feedback on the LCD display is great.  Its nice to have all the information regarding battery ; signal strength; distance and such all right in front of you in a nice clean display.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JqmiImstL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JqmiImstL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JqmiImstL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cowHtVfaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cowHtVfaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cowHtVfaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91AULVZ8yVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91AULVZ8yVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91AULVZ8yVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91f7nCez7xL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91f7nCez7xL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91f7nCez7xL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AG2HRHYQ7ZGTCQVRWBUP36UMXBYA,1571368500203,0,False

You can tilt the angle of the camera down, so you can eliminate the propellers showing up in videos. The only thing I don't like is the charge time on the battery--at least 6 hours. I bought an extra battery, but even at that you get about an hour combined and then you're done for 12 hours. Extra batteries is a must. Great little unit.<br />April 2022 update:  Unit began not responding unexpectedly.  I contacted Customer Service inquiring about a ""reset"" procedure--it was just ""locked-up"" best I could tell.

When I did that it did a barrel roll and kept flipping til it hit the deck.  lucky for me I was able to retrieve it.  If I was out somewhere else it would have been lost.  And fortunately, nothing broke.  For what it is and the price I think it's very decent.  However, at this point I am very hesitant to test it's limits or let it explore further.  I'm in between 3.5 and 4 stars.  3 because of what it did so the trust or reliability.  4/4.5 because I think it's well built and the camera was pretty good.<br /><br />Update:  I flew it a couple more time with only 1 minor hiccup.

2391,5.0,Phenomenal Drone and amazing customer service,"First, this drone is GREAT! It is heavy enough to fly through the wind, but light enough to avoid damaging itself if you accidentally crash it. Of all the drones i’ve flown, the responsiveness of this is the thing that really stands out. There is zero delay between your inputs and the drone’s reaction…essentially throughout its entire range. Also, the battery life is far superior to even $1,000+ drones from other brands. 26 min per battery is the best i’ve ever seen. I totally love this thing.<br /><br />There are tons of other features i like, but the real reason i’m writing this review is that i’ve been blown away by Holy Stone’s customer service. It’s 2022, and like every corporation is looking for a way to screw you out of money. These guys had actual humans answer my phone calls almost every single time, and they even called me back after missing a call! They promptly answered my emails, and they handled my issues until i was 100% satisfied and happy.<br /><br />Lol i totally sound like i’m shilling or something. But I genuinely cannot recommend Holy Stone any more strongly. I guess i’m just shocked to find a corporation nowadays that isn’t trying to screw me.

2392,5.0,Feature packed drone at a good price!,"Spotted a good deal on this highly rated drone during Amazon Prime days. Glad I went for it!<br />This is my first drone since the use of GPS became widely used, and wow, what a difference it makes.  GPS allows for numerous features that simplify operations and reduce the stress of flying an expensive toy…most notably, to me, is the Return Home feature. Hit that button and it flies right back to you and lands where it took off. No more runaways!<br />The drone itself is solidly built. I crashed it a couple of times during my (low speed, low altitude) initiation period, and it came through in fine shape. The camera moves in all directions easily, and takes good photos. The controls are fairly intuitive, and once you get the feel of it, very responsive. The suggested app is packed with automated operations, like “follow me”, and “point of interest”. The batteries are good for 26 minutes each, and you get two. Even the included storage was well thought out and well built.<br />I’ll enjoy this flying machine very much, and look forward to getting great pictures over and around places I could not get to before.<br />I am glad I picked the Holy Stone HS 720.

Atti control is at least usable, except it wanders off a few hundred feet if you look away for a minute.<br /><br />Video latency is measured in seconds, making it impossible to fly fpv. Video painful to watch since there's no gimbal. Quality is bad, omnivision sensor is cheap and crappy. Stills are usually blurry, but once in a while you can get one that's usable.<br /><br />Transmission distance is bad, but the controls are so unfriendly that you'll probably never run into this issue.<br /><br />Shuts itself off automatically unless it's flying. Even when you've lost it and are looking for it in the woods, even when it's connected and streaming video, even when you're transferring files off.<br /><br />Actual mechanical design of the quadcopter is excellent, it's taken some nasty tumbles and handled it well.

2438,4.0,Great drone,"This is my first drone, and I love it! There are only a couple issues but overall it has been great.<br /><br />Issue 1: The camera, it doesn’t have the quality I was expecting. It is ok when the picture is the size of your phone, but quickly pixelates when you try to zoom in.<br /><br />Issue 2: Return to home, this is more of an issue of me not understanding the system I think. The first RTH took the drone up to 50ish feet, it then ran into a 60ish foot tall tree. I then reread the directions and decided to try the RTH function in the safety of the living room. I assumed I could cancel the RTH... what happened was when I hit RTH it flew up and hit the ceiling in the house. I couldn’t cancel it.<br /><br />On the bright side! I have lightly crashed the drone 5 times now and only had to replace 1 prop, and it was more of a cosmetic replacement.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drone.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGZGDQRNGG7CU53PC55PTQENQ7CA,1585611319624,0,True

2458,4.0,So easy to set-up and fly! Fantastic drone for the price!,"I've been wondering for a while now what the drone hype was all about. Did a fair amount of research and decided on the Holy Stone HS720 as my first drone based on many of the great reviews on YouTube. I'll be first to admit, I'm a major skeptic and take all reviews with a grain of salt, but I can honestly say that I was blown away at the value of this drone.<br /><br />Everything you need to get flying is in the box, and the included instructions are clear and concise.  The drone and controller have a very solid feel and appears well made, much better than I expected considering the price.  Setup and calibration of the drone and configuration of the software (on your phone) is super easy and trouble free. The flight performance of the drone and stability in a hover blew me away, I was immediately comfortable with flying this thing knowing that if I got confused about the orientation of the drone all that I had to do was let go of the controls and let the drone right itself and wait for me to figure out what I was doing.<br /><br />Once I got comfortable with flying I tried out some of the other features such as follow me, orbit, way-point, and return to home and they do work as advertised - pretty neat.  Vertical performance was impressive - this thing will rocket-ship straight up, though decent is somewhat slower, I'm assuming it's intentional as a safety measure.  Yaw seems to be pretty quick, while roll is somewhat lazy in my opinion.  Forward speed is plenty fast enough for a beginner as the drone does get pretty small, pretty fast. Battery life is as advertised at 20-25 minutes for my flights. (Throwing this thing around the sky pretty hard.)<br /><br />The only slight negative I have is the picture / video quality. I certainly didn't expect DJI performance in this regard based on the low price, but I would like to see something better here.  The colors don't really render true to life, the saturation is pretty high, and the lens has a strong fish-eye effect. That being said, it's clear that Holy Stone put it's money into stability and flight performance and that's fantastic for beginners like me.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great, stable drone for someone getting started in flying drones and are unsure if ""it's for them"".  The included camera and single axis gimble is a bit limited in performance, but it is certainly good enough to whet your appetite for aerial photography.<br /><br />I have no regrets in buying this drone and would confidently recommend it to anyone getting started in the hobby.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFTLQF36R33JNPWHNIXI7SCELRDQ,1585491263952,0,True

2484,5.0,Beautiful Drone With Wonderful Functions!,"I have recently purchased this drone as a beginner pilot to get more involved in the drone community. Long story short, I am absolutely engrossed in this drone and its functions. I have flown it about once a day for 6 days in which it has never malfunctioned or flown away. Overall, it is a wonderful drone and you should definitely buy as it is by far the best drone under $300.<br /><br />Competition<br />A close competitor to the HS720 would be the Mavic Mini, whose price is over $400. Most if not all functions on both drones are shockingly similar in drone precision and camera quality. The main functions on both drones is the circling Point of Interest, the Return to Home, the waypoint setting, the follow me setting, and the overall stability. Sadly, while the Mavic Mini does include a 3-axis gimbal, the HS720 does not. But I would definitely shave off $100 for the same drone but with no camera gimbal!<br /><br />Motors<br />As I have flown my drone, no engines have sputtered out or lost control. The precise stabilization while flying and holding in the air is insurmountable. The quick calculations based on wind speed is wonderful as I have flown it over 10 knots of wind and it stayed relatively stable. Secondly, the brushless motors really do make a difference when coming to noisiness. The drone is mostly quiet and once flown over about 250ft. away, you can't really hear it anymore. Basically, they are great motors!<br /><br />Camera<br />The camera does have a little color correction it must fix, but overall it is pretty good. The drone does not include a 2 axis or 3 axis gimbal and there is no way to install one. To fix this, I usually just go to Emulsio and let the app do the camera stabilization work for me! Me, my family, and my friends all agree that my drone footage is amazing at how well it records.<br /><br />Remote and App<br />The remote for this drone is very nice as it shows the amount of satellites in the area. If you are not connected to over 10 satellites (I think) in your nearby area, you cannot fly. The nice, bright display on the remote is very useful for flying in the night. The app (called Ophelia GPS) shows live feed from the drone's camera and it allows you to start any function (POI, RTH, or follow me). It is also very user friendly as it is easy to set up and use.<br /><br />Battery<br />The battery on this drone is relatively good. It has a flight time of around 20-25 minutes depending on whether you record or not (recording and turning on landing lights can run down the battery faster). It takes 6-7 hours to charge and can be charged overnight. I have never heard of any fires or explosions created by the battery, but I would always keep it in an explosive-proof bag just in case. Also, after flying the drone, the battery can get hot/lukewarm. I would highly suggest to have a ""cool down"" period after flying to not get the battery too hot and explode.<br /><br />Functionality<br />Overall, this drone is very nice as a recreational use of flying. You really can't make movies or record professional videos with the HS720 (as these ""Movie Drones"" cost $3,000), as it is merely for fun. One thing I would suggest to all beginner drone flyers out there is to make sure you go onto FAADroneZone and register your drone before flying. You will get a unique registration number for your drone to fend away any lawsuits against you and your drone (that is only if you crash).<br /><br />Lastly, it is a very fun drone to fly and has upscale functions much like the more expensive drones! I have attached a video to show the drone and camera quality! Thanks for reading!",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AF765V6BACHBBFCDVLSWMTF5L4YQ,1588281829883,0,True

Last resort, try another phone.  Of course I don't carry 2 phones.  It took another 3 weeks before I got the opportunity to use a 2nd phone.  The video worked.  Briefly.  I reconnected my original phone.  It worked!  For 2 mins!  The drone was so far away I couldn't see it.  I pressed the return home and it crashed into a tree. My fault. The drone was way pasted the 30 day warranty.  I emailed HolyStone, ""How much it would cost for them to repair it?""  Their response, ""I'm glad to assist.

As shown in the pictures, I am pretty well out in the open with a few houses here and there, and i can only get a few hundred yards away before I lose connectivity.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714d01FnTKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714d01FnTKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714d01FnTKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fv1hzWseL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fv1hzWseL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fv1hzWseL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mCjOdnuAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mCjOdnuAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mCjOdnuAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AFVE62BUTW5B7QDSJP5UCQOJXFKA,1620995147441,0,True
2519,5.0,Be patient on set up and follow the steps in order and you'll have a great time.,"Great little ""non-intimidating"" drone that have a great bunch of features.  My 16 yr old son was a bit afraid to fly my DJI Phantom 3 Pro.  He would fly with me it didn't want to experiment on a larger more expensive piece of equipment.  We opened the box, charged the battery and he was off and running.  Took it to Joshua Tree National Park and took some great footage (albeit out side the park).  He loves the challenge and relative ease of operation and ""as advertised"" features of the machine.  Would definitely recommend to anyone - beginner to seasoned vet - as a perfect little drone that can carry the load of providing a great experience.",[],B07V3CLLCV,B07V3CLLCV,AGNHMZCJ4LKUSE5REWDONPEFVVXQ,1574897118093,0,True
