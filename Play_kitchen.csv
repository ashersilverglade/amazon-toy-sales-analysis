13,4.0,Great Looking Kitchen,"I bought this kitchen for my 2.5 year old twins. I must say that it looks great. It took 2 people about 2 hours to put this together as there are lots of small parts. But I think any kitchen that has reasonable amount of imaginative pieces will have the same problem. The cabinets are amazingly sturdy. The hinges are similar to what you would find in real kitchen cabinets. My twins are constantly slamming doors and having rough play but the kitchen is still withstanding all that. It is not too large to overwhelm my living room but large enough for 2-4 kids to play together. Looks beautiful. I bough Melissa and Dough Pots and Pans, Fridge food, Pantry food, Condiment set, Cake, Cupcakes and Vegetable crate for pretend play. There is still plenty of room. We bought some plastic fruits and teapot set to keep in the top. Great value for money. The only con is that I wish they had managed to add a combo washer and dryer.

17,4.0,Assembly takes a good while.,I purchased this for my playroom because I was going for a modern looking playroom and this fit that look. As far as it being the best kitchen play set out there I wouldn’t say that. It is pretty basic. The assembly takes a long time and I’m pretty sure if your not accustomed to assembling things you will hate that you tried this one. You need a electric drill because it would take forever to screw in all those screws by hand. It is also pretty small so it wouldn’t work for kids bigger than probably 4 years old. I like the white kitchen but that is about all it has going for it. I probably wouldn’t buy it because it was fun to play with.,[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AGSQ46AT7HAEIDTDK5NM3NUTJBMA,1570097816267,0,True

19,2.0,Would not recommend,"I got 2/3rds through this and am having issues I can’t ignore.<br />The only parts that come preassembled are loosely screwed. I can’t tighten the screws because the holes are stripped out already, so I had to bust out my wood glue. There are some other divots that came inserted already, that are cracked through the surface of the wood. It’s frustrating that the only things they did for you are messed up.<br />I don’t think there are an excessive number of steps. I’m not in a rush for a deadline so I can take my time and thoroughly check out the pictures to not miss anything, and you do have to scrutinize EVERY picture, in detail. Other kitchens from KitchenKraft are on the BILT app but not this one. One thing the directions don’t say but should have, is to check every screw to see if there are options for white or silver heads. I ended up using a lot of the white screws on inner panels without realizing there were options, leaving me with only silver screws on outer panels. The way this is packaged, there’s no way to know there are variations.<br />Right now, the side panel of the microwave isn’t flush with the pack of the unit. However, the groove that the thin back panel slides into is where it’s supposed to be. It’s hard to explain, but basically, this is the only way to turn this piece, and it has to be cut wrong. This is on step 23 of 35 that this is coming up, and I can’t ignore it for the price of the unit. I’m returning this. Around step 21 or 22, instructions called for me to turn a BLUNT flat screw into a plastic pole with a hole so small, it’s not possible without a pointy-tipped screw.<br />It probably took me 3 hours to get 2/3rds through. Most of that was relatively calm and fine, but the above issues slowed me down and ultimately have me trying to unassemble all this work to fit it back in the box. So if you’re considering spending the time and money on this, consider whether is is worth SIX hours to put together and take apart again so you can get your money back and break even. Sure you might be the lucky one that gets a good one, but is it worth the risk if you are not? My time is worth more than this. I could have spent this time with my son...<br /><br />UPDATE: my husband convinced me to keep it. We put it together the rest of the way; there was a second piece that sticks out the back also, and it’s clear neither is supposed to, but there’s no way to adjust it or install it differently. Maybe it’s a bad lot. Anyway, our son LOVES this set, so I’ll upping it to 2 stars. It definitely needs to be anchored to the wall as our 18 month old has pulled this over, luckily not onto himself. Our ideal location is in front of a tiled wall, though, so it’s kind of another strike against this thing to me that it’s not more bottom-heavy. His favorite part of this is the telephone and the microwave. We may take off the latches for the other cabinets, as it’s a little difficult for him to open the doors. (We have this on a hardwood floor, so you really need to use one hand to hold the unit in place and the other to open the door, or it slides towards you. A kid his age wouldn’t have that figured out by now.) our son IS tall for his age, but isn’t technically “old enough” for this set, and he already towers over it LOL...I would definitely recommend checking the measurements first as this thing is shorter than our fireplace.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdGteMTeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdGteMTeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdGteMTeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J5ONvkZ6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J5ONvkZ6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J5ONvkZ6L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaG-6IajL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaG-6IajL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZaG-6IajL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bMVy0S6ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bMVy0S6ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bMVy0S6ML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AEJMQJ55VVFH2RNIX5Z52LPVLAIA,1582413488984,0,True

It took me about 6 hours. I was very frustrated. As someone else wrote, Ikea assembly looks like a piece of cake. I could assemble an entire BEDROOM set faster than this. And this was after using power tools every step of the way.<br /><br />Very confusing way of arranging pieces. There are 3 ""E"" screws and the instructions call for 10 E screws. Wait, there are 7 more E screws all the way at the end. I mean, why couldn't they put all the 10 E screws together and call it a day. Similarly, there are 3 B screws and later on there are 5 more B screws arranged in the package. Just plainly confusing.<br /><br />Built quality is not the best, sometimes pieces didn't fit together, and had to be forced in. Thanks to my tools, I was able to Ram the pieces in where it was impossible to rectify.<br /><br />There was no way to determine the orientation of certain key pieces till you had moved 3 steps down in the manual and realize you will have to undo the last 16 minutes to go back and fix it.<br /><br />Also it's not smooth in the back side. Certain pieces and certain screws stick out of the back, so can't really have the open concept kitchen.<br /><br />Oh and the final product was wobbly.

94,4.0,"GOOD TOY, KIDS LOVE IT, HAVE A DRILL AND A FEW HOURS READY","Overall I am pleased with this item, mainly because my Kids are very happy with it! There's quite a bit to mention but I will sum it up as quick and simple while detailed for those who would and should read this.<br /><br /> To get this out of the way, would I buy it again? ABSOLUTELY!, RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND, YES! I would insist that I assemble it though as I'm sure it's easier after the first time!<br /><br /> My Kids are 2 and 3 and they love it very much, I also purchased a kids dish and kitchen utensil kit and very glad I did because it did not come with anything like that however for the price and quality I had no problem spending an extra 20$ for all the items needed to complete it (I'll come back and insert link to set I bought it was great!)<br /><br />PROS: -Definitely a real wood set very sturdy and doesn't seem cheap at all, 6/5 on quality!<br />-Comes with all screws needed and every wood piece had small holes drilled so no mishaps going through the wood at an angle! It also came with an ""extra"" section of screws an extra couple hinges and tid bits!<br />-Storage space is plentiful, my Kids put all their kitchen play items (and more) in storage spots to where it's not cluttered at all!<br />-Looks much nicer than a plastic one, all wood was painted splinter free and sturdy!<br />-Price was very good super quick delivery esp for a fairly heavy item!<br /><br />CONS AND SIDE NOTES:<br /> -I could put another one of these together in a very short time, but the first time was tedious and time consuming, instructions show all the holes and you have to pay very close attention to the orientation of every one of the many many pieces, maybe not a con but it took me a while.<br /><br />-IMPORTANT!!! - This comes with a seperate bag that has a flexible but sturdy plastic strap that makes it so you can anchor it into a wall or non movable object, when my 2yr old pulls the kitchen door open I got nervous at how much it moved and I STRONGLY recommend you use the Anchor!<br /><br />-Alot of pieces, and screws, nuts as well as hinges.. Although high quality again the orientation has got to be dead on or you will be tearing it back apart! Screws are labeled by their letter and then quantity, and not in alphabetical order, also the same ""A"" screw will have 2 slots one has like 5 white painted head A screws and across the cardboard there are like 10++ ""A"" screws not painted. (The same letter screw painted or not, are interchangeable.)<br />-With alot of parts you really need to take inventory first and make sure they are all there. The wood pieces that are #9 (2 of them) will have a _ under the 9 so not to be confused as a #6 even though I don't remember a 6.<br />-Very tight shutting doors that need to break in a little. Microwave did not and was only door that did not have something to keep it shut so I use small magnet strips to keep it shut!<br /><br />Ok so it shows in the manual needing a Phillips screwdriver... If you are trying to get away and take your time if you have time then use a screwdriver, I used a light impact electric drill and it saved me hours of time and no damage!<br />The directions are better than most toys illustrations are visually as helpful as they can be, and the English part is real English not half fast translated, I'm a Man but I read manual many times to be sure.<br /><br />As simple yet time consuming to assemble honestly I would have paid someone 75$ to assemble it just for the time, but I appreciate it more for my kids because I put it together myself!<br /><br />Dont Cheat out on screws, they are all there for a good reason and when completed you'll also see why! I did not have to put one single sticker on it that was already good to go which helped ALOT too!<br /><br />Conclusion: If your a stay at home Mom with no extra time and chasing little ones around all day, I'd recommend having someone (husband boyfriend, girlfriend, just someone else) assemble it and not where the kids can see. Most people should not shy away from this because I say it's tedious to put together. I build electronics and PCS, not much of a carpenter and I use that term because you really do build a real little kitchen! Count every part first and mine came with 1 wooden piece with no number but wasn't hard to figure out, follow instructions to a T don't cut corners, and ANCHOR IT TO SOMETHING STURDY, get frustrated just take a quick break and you'll be fine!<br />It was a decent amount of more work than I expected but overall I'm confident I made a good choice on this and my kids agree with me!<br /><br />Hope this helps!",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AHQ7W2RMR75SBH2XZZJKGZTY6TDA,1585450381749,27,True

121,3.0,"Looks super cute, but doesn't hold up well","I bought this kitchen because I wanted something sturdy and life-like, nothing plastic with batteries.<br /><br />We already have a kidkraft dollhouse, so I figured assembling this wouldn't be much different. Let me tell you - the dollhouse is the novice level and this is the expert level. It comes in a pile of wood and screws. But, the instructions were relatively easy to follow once you have your pieces sorted.<br /><br />It is all solid wood and very sturdy. I think it will hold up much better than our previous plastic kitchens. The buttons on the microwave and the dials on the oven are painted on - not stickers that can be peeled off.  The cabinets are all plenty roomy enough to store play food, but the ""water dispenser"" is too short for any play cups except teacups. The sink is also just popped into place, so it's definitely possible that a tactical child could remove it.<br /><br />I had originally looked at a model a bit bigger than this one, but went with this one because the sale price was too good to pass up. You can see my 3 yr old son next to it. He's a hair taller than the fridge, but it's still a good size kitchen for him. However, if your child is already 5+, I would definitely go with a bigger one.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was that the microwave door came with a chip in it, but altogether the kitchen looks really nice (seen here with the Melissa and Doug Kitchen Accessory Set) and I'm pretty happy with it. It's not a toy that I mind being out where guests see it. It's been a huge hit with my son, and, since it's for him, he's the final critic here.<br /><br />ETA: less than one year later, this has not held up well AT ALL. I'll be the first to admit that my kids are hard on toys, but I do also feel that toys should be made to withstand that. The oven door hangs crooked, phone is long since lost, oven shelf is gone, one burner came completely off, the other burner is cracked, wood got dinged. I feel like I should have stuck with a plastic kitchen at this point.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617-eSz6URL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617-eSz6URL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617-eSz6URL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GNOqaRQaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GNOqaRQaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GNOqaRQaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61P1pGM89bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61P1pGM89bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61P1pGM89bL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oGIhtns3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oGIhtns3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oGIhtns3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p-CPg536L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p-CPg536L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61p-CPg536L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rHpVCWgOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rHpVCWgOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rHpVCWgOL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rPi4QYiSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rPi4QYiSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rPi4QYiSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sVioFg4iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sVioFg4iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sVioFg4iL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716STIh2ZwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716STIh2ZwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716STIh2ZwL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AG4SPhJ9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AG4SPhJ9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71AG4SPhJ9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K6wvsEzoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K6wvsEzoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K6wvsEzoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mmjcuyL2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mmjcuyL2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mmjcuyL2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFCHCD3I7KYR52WDGBQOZDUSVXKQ,1578193612233,3,True

134,4.0,Much fun after a lot of work for grandpa,"First the good news: The kitchen is the sturdiest toy I've seen in a long time.  Made almost entirely of wood, once assembled it will probably stand up to a good workout administered by an energetic toddler.  My 2 year old grandson loved it immediately.<br /><br />Now the not so good news: After seeing an on-line review that said assembly took 2 hours I thought that I knew what to expect. Wrong!  It took this 71 year old judge about 5 hours, much of it spent in very twisted positions on the floor, to complete the assembly.  Boy was I stiff when I finished!  The assembly instructions for this apparently Dutch designed kitchen may very well have been written by an engineer who was high on pot when he visited an Ikea store.  Much of the hardware is what you'll find with Ikea furniture, and the instructions are drawings without text.  The main problems were that: Some of the drawings involve too many parts at once, so that it can be hard to figure out what goes where; various similar pieces of hardware have almost identical identifications; and the instructions for one of the last steps (attaching the top shelf) refer to incorrect hardware--in two cases a bolt is identified without noting that a particular end fastener must also be used, and in the third case you are told to use a bolt that doesn't fit, and the correct bolt that would screw into the underlying pipe on the end of the shelf is not provided, although the kitchen seems fine without it.  Also, earlier on (unless I missed it), you're told neither to affix two door closing fasteners nor which bolts and nuts to do it with.<br /><br />I'm still happy with the purchase after seeing how much my grandson loves it.  I did, however, tell my daughter and son in law &#34;no more project toys.&#34;",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AEOUTYQVWUEKZKVNPKYNYKCWLSDA,1394992209000,1,True
135,4.0,Tough assembly but so cute when complete!,"Once you get this put together it is really fun and so cute.  The working knobs and faucets are a real hit with my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter.  It's the perfect size for her, she loves the cupboards and really enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the assembly was brutal! My husband can take apart engines and transmissions and rebuild them, so he is talented in the area of tedious assembly. This project took almost 5 hours to assemble. The instruction booklet has no words and is a series of pictures with over 30 steps to complete.  The other little quirk is you have to pull pretty hard to open the refrigerator and it jerks the whole unit pretty hard.  We are going to try and fix that if we can.<br /><br />I really love the set since all the other kitchens out there are plastic and this is like a finished chip board which is so much nicer.  The vintage detailing really makes the unit special, and unique.  The assembly, while daunting, can be done if you take your time and complete one step at a time. The end result is a darling kitchen that will last for years.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AHAWGZDCAIG2QQQAG3DCWYVUAR3A,1553274466000,0,True

All of this after painstakingly trying to put thing kids play kitchen together. give me a break! This is a terrible company with even more disgraceful customer service. Try getting a replacement part from them for your product that is brand new and they will try charging you a ridiculous fee compared to what you originally paid for the kitchen or flat out cancel your request without an explanation or help. They tried telling me that the &#34;batch code&#34; was out of date! And again it was just purchased new. Call customer service and you will just be going in circles. If you don't have your original receipt they won't even try to help you get the parts you need. They even had the nerve to say I was trying to scam them out of replacement parts- really?? What would I be doing with said parts other than trying to put together my daughters birthday present? What happened to standing behind your products, they obviously have a ridiculous replacement parts warranty because they know their products are crap and break. What happened to the days of good quality customer service and the customer always being right? I had purchased from them before but NEVER again. They are quick to just disregard and lose loyal customers so I am quick to find a better more ethical company that puts customer satisfaction above all....",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFBEQVBZUHNSMSXHFTBOAQKMAS6Q,1445389248000,1,False

235,5.0,Great Kitchen Set,"This is a fantastic kitchen set we bought for our 22 month old.  The quality is what stands out the most - Good solid wood construction with real metal screws and hinges.  When assembled, the unit is sturdy and even the plastic handles and sink are well made. While we are very happy with this kitchen, and our daughter absolutely loves it, there are few things you should know ahead of time:<br /><br />Pros:<br />* When assembled, the unit is one single piece and very sturdy.  It's not top heavy at all and I don't have much concern about it tipping.  But if you do, there's an included wall-tie.<br />* The surfaces are really easy to clean. The first thing my daughter did was walk up to this thing with a purple crayon, but it wiped right off with a wet paper towel.<br />* The oven door swings out instead of down, which I have read is a safety problem on other kitchens.<br />* Extra parts!  They include a couple extra of each type of screw (there are about 10 different types) and they're in a specific pouch labeled ""extra parts"".  Excellent touch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* There are a lot of pieces.  Like about 140 including screws...so be ready to set some time aside for assembly.  It took me just over 3 hours to completely assemble this unit. (also, I recommend using your own quality allen wrench - the one that's included doesn't have good bite and there are a few pieces like the feet that are really difficult to get on)<br />* Because the doors and cabinets are made of real wood, it will sound like real wood smashing together every time your toddler slams the refrigerator door...over and over and over again.<br />* Each piece is supposed to be labeled with a number, but many of the stickers with the numbers had fallen off.  I recommend laying everything out first so you're sure of what's what.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AEIOZJ62VHOQQWNU6GU2Z3KSOOXA,1378748682000,1,True

241,1.0,Assembly in progress will update when complete,"I read quite a few of the reviews both positive and negative before ordering this kitchen, so we went into this expecting an extensive assembly project AND as my review title states my husband is still assembling our kitchen.  I decided to start writing my review so that I don't forget the issues that we are having as we go.<br />Honestly,  before we even began assembling we wondered if we had the correct hardware packet included with our kitchen.  Seriously,  right off the bat things weren't adding up,  manual indicates we should have a certain number of a pieces and the packet has a different amount.  Then there is R in the hardware kit but no R in the parts list in the manual. Maybe there will be an R further on in the assembly instructions but we would've liked to make sure that we had everything that we needed before we started.  Also,  assembly instructions indicate that the tools needed are only the ones included,  an Allen wrench and another little wrench but a screw driver is clearly needed as well,  oh and a drill.  One of the pieces of wood is chipped.  The piece that will be the counter top,  at the edge of the sink.  Truly I have already suggested to my husband that we return this kitchen several times but what a hassle?  So we've decided to press on.  Just now my husband came out to tell me that he was screwing in the last little screw on the back of the refrigerator door,  one of four that mounts the ""water dispenser"" on the fridge door and it broke.  Just broke.  Mind you, my husband his hand screwing everything,  he is not using any drills or electric screw drivers.  Which someone else suggested you do because you literally have to screw in every required screw,  my husbands hands are already sore.<br />I also want to make mention that we have assembled an entire household full of IKEA furniture so this is not a matter of inexperience.<br />I will continue to update this review until assembly is completed.  I will also add photos.<br />I haven't been able to figure out how to label the photos so I'll have to describe what way pic is showing.<br />Photo #1 is the parts list at the beginning of the assembly manual.  Notice parts A 14, A 5,  E 14 and E 2,  this will be important when I explain photo# 2.<br />Photo #2 is the hardware.  Each grouped by letter and a number indicating how many are included.  So referring to photo #1 you will see that the manuals parts list indicates that there will be 19 of part A technically there are but separated in two groups 14 in one and 5 in the other.  The group of 5 have white tops the group of 14 has chrome tops.  You can NEVER tell when the white topped screws are to be used and when the chrome topped screws are to be used.  This is also the case with parts E,  there are the correct amount but separated and some have white tops and some have chrome,  no indication of when to us which.<br />Photo #3 shows the broken screw that I mentioned earlier in my review.<br />Photo #4 shows the chip in the wood on the counter top at the edge of the sink.  It arrived that way,  we discussed returning it but decided that we could do that and receive another one with other damage,  this was fairly minor and maybe the sink will partially conceal it once in place.  I'll let you know.<br />Now it would seem that some of our actual panels have been mislabeled,  luckily we caught it before we began screwing them into place.  I don't know if the item that we received was a return or just a total factory reject?<br />7 hours later (including a lunch and restroom break) so it probably took about 5 hours of solid work to assemble.<br />End result picture #5 our son LOVES it.<br />However,  it is not as high quality as other reviewers claimed.  I don't know what they're used to.?  The mystery of parts R was never resolved but as you can see from photo # 2 there were quite a few parts labeled ""extra"" so ...?<br />I guess that doesn't matter though,  in the end our son just loves opening and closing the fridge, oven,  and cabinets and stirring his lil pots on the stove.  And we enjoy the retro look that fits in with our actual kitchen.<br />I probably would not recommend this kitchen to anyone if asked.<br />P.S. Photo #6 the sink in place does conceal the chip.  The sink is removable so I will have to glue the chip down so that our son doesn't get scraped or a sliver.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616Bf+BXASL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616Bf+BXASL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616Bf+BXASL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HpcfF2+bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HpcfF2+bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HpcfF2+bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O2kvukMUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O2kvukMUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O2kvukMUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U2YokZAAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U2YokZAAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U2YokZAAL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71swQd8DovL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71swQd8DovL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71swQd8DovL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u9zIcQ3lL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u9zIcQ3lL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71u9zIcQ3lL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AEHUASYI4IHY3B6562YJCBRAQHUQ,1469399359000,14,True

I like that it didn't look so juvenile with bright plastic colors.  It actually looks pretty good in our kitchen area.  The size is also nice- it isn't so huge that it takes up a whole wall.

To not feel like I spent $89 dollars for nothing.<br />My husband I went to put this kitchen together and the instructions were not very easy to follow. As we were putting it together we found that there missing bolts to the kitchen. Who wants to have to call or contact the company to get what should have already been in the package. I have a 2.5 yr old and she had already seen us trying to putting it together and to have to send this back along with waiting for another one to come. I expected this to be bigger in size and it’s extremely short and small. Which isn’t bad but I was expecting it to look bigger than it was.

Kudos to KidKraft on a fabulous design.<br /><br />This play kitchen is small but mighty! It is easy to move around and small enough that when it is not in use it can be easily stored. We love how compact this play kitchen is making it easy to move around the house {we change where our play areas are frequently to keep things fresh}.<br /><br />We are a huge fan of functionality of this kitchen. Every door has a handle and is able to open and close. Every knob turns. Each door is also furnished with a cabinet latch that prevents the cabinets from swinging open on their own.<br /><br />My children love that their kitchen mimics mommy's kitchen. The stove and microwave can both be seen through and the microwave has a turntable! These features make pretend play in the play kitchen that much more realistic for them.<br /><br />Another great and well thought out feature is the removable sink. My boys have a tendency to get sticky little fingers on everything. They also like to play with their real snacks in their play kitchen. Being able to easily remove the sink to clean is extremely convenient.<br /><br />The White Vintage Kitchen does not come fully assembled. It does come with detailed step-by-step pictorial instructions. Although it took us about two hours to put together, we had a fun time working on this project as a family.

319,4.0,"Cute, but difficult to put together","Cute little kitchen, but difficult and time consuming to put together. One of the pre-drilled holes for screws that hold the plastic door closure of the middle bottom cupboard was too big and we couldn’t get the screw to work so we are going to glue it. Of course the night we set it up, our daughter ran up to it to play and fell right onto the cupboard door that was unable to close due to the screw problem and got a nice gash in her forehead.  I should’ve glued it immediately. That brings me to my next point in that the edges/corners are pretty sharp. I may have been better served going with a cheaper plastic kitchen where my daughter is only 18 months and somewhat uncoordinated. However, the kitchen would be a bit too small for a 4-5 year old that would have more coordination and not be as prone to falling or tripping. Some of the doors are too hard for for her to open too. That said, she loves this kitchen and plays with it frequently. Other than the first night, we haven’t had any more mishaps.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rOds6RtCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rOds6RtCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rOds6RtCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AEU4CACKGJ6GU7QV6XUKRKPKQIHQ,1542322810577,1,True

351,4.0,"Good product, but a pain to assemble","CONS<br />- LOOOONG ASSEMBLY - ll the reviews saying it's hard to assemble are correct. There are like 50+ parts and it took me at least 6 hours. Much of that time is the result of me unscrewing and re-screwing the plain screws or the painted screws or vice-versa. That is, there are identical painted screw that show on the exterior, and plain screws on the interior, but they're labeled exactly the same in the instructions which never differentiate. You do figure that out eventually though.<br /><br />- WALL ANCHOR COMPLETELY USELY - There is no possible way to screw it in unless you want it to show at the top or have a screw driver that is less than 5 inches long if you want to hide it behind the kitchen itself.<br /><br />- KIND OF SHORT - One thing I'm concerned about actually is it's height. My kids are both 15 months old, and when they really understand what this is for, it seems they will tower over it<br /><br />PROS<br />ASSEMBLY IS TIME-CONSUMING, BUT NOT HARD - All this said, it's not actually difficult to assemble. Instructions (aside from the plain vs. painted screws) are good, and nothing really gave much trouble. Didn't have to force anything. Get a few beers, put on some football, and it comes together.<br /><br />FEELS PRETTY STURDY and does look like a pretty quality product. My screw driver might slip sometime on the surface, but never left a scratch, so I have some confidence it can take a beating.<br /><br />GOOD LOOKIN'<br /><br />KIDS VERY DRAWN TO IT - Our kids are pretty young to understand exactly what this is, but they're pretty drawn to it.

Some of the reviews mentioned an hour and a half. HAHAHA. Maybe if you are a Kidcraft employee or a construction worker. This project took my husband and myself 4 entire hours. The instructions are a little confusing and I am surprised we got the whole thing assembled without having to go back because we did one of the steps backwards. After it all though, this is an adorable little playset and our daughter loves it. So, it was worth it, I suppose. Just beware of the time that it takes to put it together. And maybe call a few woodworking friends over, tell everyone to bring a screwdriver. :)",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AE3NTOQE2BLMTCX63IABPSIG5HLA,1577579744209,0,True
360,4.0,"Takes a long time to assemble, finished product pays off","We ordered this for our 2yr old as her big Santa gift, after comparing many many kitchens- I was having a hard time deciding...A friend saw it on sale for $99 on cyber Monday and I didn't hesitate at that price- definitely shop around before purchasing as many sites carry this exact kitchen at a wide range of prices. I am glad I went for it as we are pleased with it overall. Thankfully, my husband started assembling a couple nights before Christmas- it took about 4+ hours total of assembly time for my husband by himself, the time was broken up and he wasn't in a hurry- so *maybe* it can be done in less. We know others who own it who gave a similar time frame though- at least 3 hrs. My husband did say that it was not difficult, just tedious & time consuming. He didn't have trouble with the instructions but he was pretty frustrated by all the little parts & steps during the process- despite all this, even he seemed won over once our daughter saw it.<br /><br />Cons- long assembly time- lots of parts, there were marks/scratches on several of the pieces that seemed to have occurred during packaging- none of them affected the function or were damaging to the structure & fortunately none of them were on the visible exterior- I feel this was just luck though so I'd recommend looking at it as soon as it arrives to make sure all pieces are in good shape in case you need to send back etc, the stove knobs should make a clicking sound- 2 of the them broke/stopped clicking almost immediately- the inside part that makes them click is plastic & not very substantial (my daughter will never know the difference & it doesn't matter to me, but it bothered my husband that they don't function as intended)<br /><br />Pros- Most importantly- my child loves it...it's absolutely adorable & looks exactly as pictured- very aesthetic & appealing- if you like the Pottery Barn kitchens but not the price tag - this is a budget friendly & comparable option, I liked that it's available in white (which we chose)- more realistic than others on the market and also gender neutral, hinges are sturdy- as are the doors/other parts, all edges are smooth & rounded- no sharp pieces or corners to bump into as i saw in negative reviews of similar products, the entire kitchen is good quality/feels stable but the whole thing is also easy for adults to move around while still not easy for a toddler to tip over (it does come with what you need to attach it to wall for added safety if needed), it offers all parts of the kitchen in one compact piece- it doesn't take up a huge amount of space but stills gives the feel of a full sized play kitchen- and includes the refrigerator (& a microwave which doesn't really fit the vintage theme but its a part of our busy life here in 2013 & my daughter went for it first out of every other feature!) unlike others in this size & price range, I also like that the sink comes out- I'm not sure how much you'd want water in it- but you *could* take it out to wash it or to empty water out if it ended up in there...once it was assembled, I felt the door latches were a little tight & worried my daughter might have a little trouble opening/closing the doors but she had no trouble at all. The stove door has the handle at the top (like a real stove) but the stove door actually opens on the side- this was confusing for my daughter at first but she quickly figured it out. I can understand why they did it this way- it would probably end up being stood on & eventually broken if they'd made it the way it seems like it should go. I was torn about ordering this versus one with more &#34;bells & whistles&#34; (such as the step2 kitchens) ultimately though, I think the simplicity of this fosters more creative play as it doesn't do all the work for her! Her imagination is still hard at work without it needing to make sounds, lighting up & so forth...plus, no batteries and less things to stop working! Another small added bonus is, everything is painted on this kitchen versus stickers -which often get peeled off, faded & damaged with time.<br /><br />(Side note- Most of the toy food & kitchen toys- variety of brands- we had already are to scale with this kitchen, including the IKEA brand toy pots & pans, however the IKEA baking set comes with cookie pans & those do not fit flat in this oven)<br /><br />The small size of this could be a pro or con- my daughter is a petite 2yr old and it is perfect for her...however, I almost wish we had ordered it awhile back to increase length of play time. She can reach everything perfectly now & loves it, but will probably be taller than the kitchen by age 3- i think she will still play with it even after that but given her current height, she could have probably handled something taller/larger already, so if your child is older or taller at the time of ordering, id recommend just ordering something taller to begin with & alleviating any concern that your child will quickly outgrow it.  I did look at the measurements before ordering & measured the space we planned to put it in and knew it was on the smaller side, seeing it in person though -it still just seems a little smaller than expected. I just recommend really comparing the size of this to your child's height before ordering- if my child was older, I think I would have been disappointed in this size. I see people who've mentioned this for older children (over 3-4) and I really couldn't imagine ordering this for a preschooler versus a toddler. Again though, the sizing can be a positive or negative feature, depending on your particular child/house- if you're like us, we have so many other toys so it's actually nice to get the kitchen experience without it taking up an entire play room.<br /><br />I would recommend this kitchen to others, particular those ordering for children under 3. I'd also order KidKraft again based on this product- even though it was a pain to assemble.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AF4JJNHXIUNEEYKNN5EQ2XFCJ32A,1388103954000,0,False

362,2.0,Disappointed in product and customer service,"We bought this kitchen for our one-year-old daughter who loves playing with the play kitchen at her grandparents house. Her grandparents actually picked this one out and had it shipped to us, so I didn’t get a chance to read the reviews or really research the kitchen much prior.<br /><br />My first disappointment came with the fact that the microwave is missing the turntable that is both listed in the description and shown in the company stock photos provided for the product. While this might not seem like a big deal to most, one of the things we were excited about with this kitchen was the turntable because we thought it would resemble a Lazy Susan which we have in our kitchen, and my daughter loves to play with. I’ve been in touch with customer service who is unwilling to send the item to me to complete our kitchen. It seems as though they are aware of the mistake on the Amazon listing, and have been for weeks according to other commenters, and have yet to fix the information. This is horrible marketing and customer service.<br /><br />My next issue is with the size of this kitchen. Right now, at 12 months, the kitchen is actually the perfect size for my daughter. She can reach everything, including the top shelf of the refrigerator and the microwave. However, it does not fit the Melissa and Doug cookie sheets or any bulky kitchen sets, and I fear that by next year she will be too big for it. It has no place to hang utensils or cups, so I had to add command hooks to the side to try and add extra storage. While this kitchen seems sturdy and well-built, it definitely will not grow with your child.<br /><br />I was going to give this product one star because of the horrible customer service, the small size, and the fact that it took me over five hours to put together even though I am quite savvy with this sort of thing. Even though it was very easy to follow the instructions, the assembly was so time-consuming. The company should really add the door hinges before shipping, that would’ve saved a lot of time. I added an extra star because my one year-old can reach all the components of this kitchen, and seems to enjoy it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6161dqHcKdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6161dqHcKdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6161dqHcKdL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QH6X+2JL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QH6X+2JL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716QH6X+2JL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CEiIG6bjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CEiIG6bjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71CEiIG6bjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFNPY6M4R4BIATVZTFY4VB45G7GQ,1579289764577,0,True

Our pieces were in perfect condition,  well-labeled, and everything went smoothly.  Grandpa, a farmer who knows how to build and fix most everything, took most of the day to assemble this set (a break for lunch and supper).  It is well-made and super cute.  We would buy it again.

A few weeks ago, some of the doors started to pop back open after trying to shut them. You have to shut them a few times before the little nub fits properly in the groove.

I'm honestly not sure it's worth the trouble compared to other options out there (Ikea etc).<br /><br />It took 4 hours, no joke, to put it together, and I'm quite handy with these kinds of things. On top of that, 2 parts didn't fit quite right, so I had to work around them to get the thing up and running enough for my kid to play with. I've emailed kidkraft to request replacements, but it's very frustrating when you're 3 hours in to realize that it won't be perfect once you're finally done.<br /><br />I picked this kitchen since my kid loved playing with it at an AirBnB we stayed at, especially the phone which other models don't have. It also has a refrigerator, which I thought would be fun, but it mainly serves as storage, so if I had to choose all over again I'd probably pick another model and just get a small toy phone to go with it.<br /><br />Honestly if I hadn't run into the two misfit pieces I'd probably give it four stars. Five for fun, minus one for assembly. If kidkraft sends me new pieces and they fit, I'll update my review accordingly.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFH33HTNQK3QPSHRFERT4GYMNCUA,1505685220091,1,True

My husband happens to be a very patient man with an ability to put just about anything together, but this almost changed him for good. He experienced anger and emotional and physical pain while trying to put this together. It wasn't till he tightened the last screw and saw how our son immediately fell in love with it did he mention how this toy may have been worth the living hell he experienced putting it together.

It’s sturdy and solid. It looks like it will be enjoyed for years to come. It’s not a huge kitchen. Great for smaller spaces while having all of the kitchen needs. Great for storage too. I do have to say that if you don’t like putting things together though than pass. Every piece you see on this little cutie has to be assembled by you! The instructions could be better. They’re in pictures, no words. Some of the screws that are labeled the same letter are silver and some are white. The white ones go on the outside areas but they don’t tell you when to use the white ones so I unfortunately have a couple of silver ones on the outside. For me it wasn’t bothersome enough for me to remove them and switch them out. The parts are labeled well enough but the screw packaging could be a bit easier to get into. Don’t let this or the other reviews deter you from getting this little gem. All and all it was worth it. Just lay out all of the pieces first and be prepared to spend a couple of hours on it.

There is nothing already assembled for you (no knobs already on, no hinges attached, nothing to make it even slightly easier). The instructions are awful as well. To make it worse, it's also missing pieces. So I called and they have to ship me the missing parts but who knows when that will be.<br /><br />Hopefully it's cute when it's put together.

460,4.0,cute but be prepared for CONSTRUCTION,"This is a cute kitchen, perfect for my average-sized 21 month old. She loves it! I will say that it is fairly small and compact, which is what I wanted for now since I have a small kitchen. It is the perfect size for her now - microwave is at perfect standing height - but I can't imagine a 3 year old or bigger playing with it - it would just to be small and short. Also, I can't imagine more than 1 child, especially older toddlers, playing together; it's really built for one. But, for the purpose of a young toddler, it is great. I would give it a 5 based on final appearances and the fact that my daughter loves it and I think it is sturdy and of good quality. But....<br /><br />Be prepared for some work to get it together! The reviews seem to indicate an average of 2-3 hours to build it. I think either those reviewers had someone else helping them, are very very good at mechanical things, or underestimated the time. I think I'm a smart woman and not inexperienced at putting together my share of Ikea furniture, but this almost brought me to my knees.  I estimate 6-8 hours total. I highly recommend a previous suggestion to separate all hardware and place into individually labelled plastic baggies - the way they are packaged is very weird. I was fortunate to have every piece and so had no issues with that, unlike some other reviewers. My biggest issue was with the sheer physicality of the assembly. The pieces are small, and you have to turn a million little screws into little bolts, etc with this small Allen wrench and little awkward wrench......my hands and fingertips are still sore 48 hours later. I really think that some of this assembly could have been predone. For example, 4 of 5 doors came with hinges prescrewed on - one did not, and it was a painful exercise in manual dexterity to get the hinge on the door. Why couldn't that have been done? Also, while generally everything &#34;worked&#34; and I did not find the pictoral instructions difficult, some the of bolt parts were not of good quality. For example, in 2 places I had A screws that would not completely screw into B locking bolts. Turns out that if not angled correctly, B bolts warp and become nonfunctional. Must be the reason why 2 extra A screws and B bolts are provided (there is no other extra hardware provided). Problem is that B bolts are now stuck in the wood and I can't get them out, which means that those corners are not secure. Overall, it doesn't matter, the unit is stable, but it was a time sink trying to get that to work and it still isn't right.  PITA!

You have to pay really close attention to how pieces are oriented in the photo instructions, and there are just a TON of pieces.

I didn't do well with this, but luckily had some white craft paint to fix that mistake.<br /><br />That being said, we got it together with only one time-wasting error and it is very, very solid.

I love that it doesn't make my family room look like a daycare the way a lot of plastic toys do.

We received this as a gift for our daughter, so I guess I can't complain there. But I will to you potential buyers. If you overpay for this, be prepared to also spend anywhere from (depending on your assembly expertise) 3-5 hours putting this together. If you don't possess assembly expertise, I highly recommend you either get someone who does, or pass on this thing all together. Actually quit reading and just pass on it now. Haha<br /><br />Ours was also damaged where the box was apparently dropped in transit. The white that covers the particle board was chipped off on the top shelf. Didn't see this until after all pieces were removed from the box, so no way to return it after that.<br /><br />There are literally 30+ pieces of covered ""wood"" and a million screws / small parts. Yikes! Not one thing comes pre-assembled.<br /><br />Once complete, it's a lot smaller than expected, unstable, and very odd in size. This thing could be pulled over onto your kiddo very easily.

498,1.0,Not Fantastic.....,"We ordered this for our granddaughter for Christmas. Let me just say that if you embark on this adventure you are going to owe your husband a burger and a couple of beers for putting this bad boy together. First off, it was disappointing to open the box to broken pieces. I have reached out to customer service with no response, automated call...heavy call volume...blah, blah, blah. Amazon offers full return and replace or refund only. With just a few days before Christmas the chances of getting a replacement are likely slim so I am going to take the little broken bowl and drive all over town trying to find one in the same circumference over the next 72 hours; pretty excited about that. My husband and I both are fairly handy people but wow, these instructions make Ikea instructions look like a work by Shakespeare and somehow they get worse as you get closer to the end of the little booklet. I think the author gave up on life as this document developed; or rather failed to develop. Hardware has an alpha labeling system but there are multiple components labeled with the same letter. Our box had two segments labeled G but they were different size screws and a different count. Some screws in the same segment had the heads painted white while others do not. If you can get through the assembly and remain semi-sane it is a sturdy little kitchen for a toddler and cute, or would be if it had arrived intact.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pCOUrpLGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pCOUrpLGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pCOUrpLGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uipKYBYNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uipKYBYNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uipKYBYNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AEBGWXHQSIWYT5UOMK274GTJSZJQ,1671392507434,1,True

506,3.0,Cute but could be much better,I bought this for my grand-daughter. A warning to anyone giving this as a Christmas present - don't wait until Christmas eve and think you are going to whip it together. Assembly takes quite a while. Lots of hardware and some pretty silly placement. You'll need a stubby Phillips screwdriver to get to some of the screws. The hinges are a pain. There are 8 hinges and each requires 4 screws and nuts. The nuts strip very easy - make sure you start them by hand and get them on straight.  There were only two spare nuts provided  - I stripped 3. Also two of the screws (A & G) have both painted and unpainted versions in the kit. The instructions don't say anything about that - they let you figure it out yourself.  At that point you either disassemble and swap the unpainted screws to inside locations or live with it. Unfortunately I'm not the live with it type so even more assembly time moving screws around. Why Kidcraft didn't label the painted screws a different letter I don't understand. I guess they didn't realize there's 26 letters in the alphabet.  They could make this product much better and cut assembly time way down by having thread formed holes on the hinges instead of the 36 low quality tiny nuts. Also 2 parts seem to be too long - Item 5 (top of fridge) and Item 38 (right side of microwave) but fortunately it's at the back of the kitchen. It does expose some bare non-laminated wood but it's not too noticeable. Also seems weird they didn't put a latch on the microwave door - all the other doors have them.  Overall it's not bad quality and is very cute.,[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AH5DATDFVF2EZDTD2KNF5CKLGXOQ,1545506905855,0,True

553,2.0,A nightmare,"At first I was just overwhelmed with the insane amount of parts to this thing. But I thought “I wanted this vintage-looking kitchen for my kid, so I can do this.” But my frustration quickly grew. It started with unclear instructions. For example, it labels all screws by letters, but then those lettered screws come in 2 categories: ones with white heads and ones with the plain metal heads. It doesn’t specify which ones to use where so I had to teach myself that the white ones would be visible from the outside of the unit as to ‘blend in.’ That’s great- but tell me that in the instructions folks. To top it off, there were never enough white-head ones to amount to what is visible from the outside of the unit. When I got more of the unit put together, I noticed some pieces were obviously. It wrong, because they stick out of the back of the unit in an inconsistent way (see pictures). Now, I am a smart human being, and I’ve put together a lot of furniture. When screws and parts were a pain or didn’t seem to fit together in a cohesive way, I triple checked the numbers on the boards and the letters on the screws to make sure I was doing it correctly. What I got wrong I corrected, but much I got right, and it looks like crap. What started out as an exciting project turned into a hunk of junk in my daughters’ playroom. Not worth the money.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Q02G-aKXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Q02G-aKXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Q02G-aKXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yAOPikw8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yAOPikw8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yAOPikw8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AHUHBT7G5EKPNFGMBAY5ZP4E56WA,1672680555332,0,True

He opens the doors and pulls food out and in all the time. I wish there was a way to lock the shelves in place and I would glue the sides of the sink in so that they don't pop it out and break the small legs that hold it in place. I really wish there was more &#34;counter space.&#34;  My daughter loves to &#34;cut&#34; her vegetables and plate things and has asked for appliances but there really isn't any room for them. We will probably set up a shelf near the kitchen to house all the extra gadgets.

588,4.0,Awesome 1st play ktichen,"This is a fabulous little kitchen for our 19month old. I wanted something on the small side, without crazy kid colors as it will be in our main living space. This definitely fits the bill. If your child is 3-4yrs old it may actually be a bit too small for them though. It has wonderful detail and is solidly built. Assembly was easy, albeit timing consuming. It took my husband and I around 2hrs to put together on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />My only two complaints that keep it from getting 5 stars is 1) the sink bowl is very easy for little people to remove. Our daughter seems to like to remove it all the time. and 2) The shelf in the refrigerator is also removable. For our daughter who is small it is over her head and she has pulled it out and had it fall on her. Both of these are easy fixes though. We are going to glue the sink in place and screw the shelf into place.<br /><br />FYI our daughter also managed to pull the entire kitchen down on herself (trying to climb it) before we had a chance to attach it to the wall, so make sure you use the provided wall strap.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AF3NEMOPYZKJZAKEAFE4AVRA7K4A,1388755111000,1,True

The difference, I noticed, was some were painted white and some weren’t. So keep in mind where you’d want the painted screw heads to be (facing outside).<br /><br />Look ahead. I repeat. Look at the instructions ahead. Read the whole thing before starting because I noticed some of the illustrations were inaccurate and I had to redo a couple of steps.<br /><br />KidKraft doesn’t recommend using power tools, so get those arms working. I can see why they didn’t, though. In one of the boards, there is a plastic piece that locks the screws. Well, I’m no Super Woman, but apparently even with my own strength I was able to almost pry the plastic piece out.<br /><br />Once finished, this is one glorious play kitchen. Sturdy, beautifully made, and cute design. My daughter especially loved that the stove knobs “clicks” for a real feel.

That's when things went south. The holes on the hinges didn't match up with the holes on the door and when we finagled it so it would the door hit the other door when it shut, leaving it ajar.

The screws and bolts were labeled with letters. The instructions were clear and easy to read drawings. It reminded me of Ikea instructions and I find these work out great for products like this one.<br /><br />Once the kitchen was put together, I found it to be extremely good quality and sturdy. My daughter is only 1 year old now but I see her using this for years and years to come. We put it up in our kitchen so she can cook while we cook.

740,4.0,Be prepared to become Bob the Builder...,"Luckily I saw the video posted with this product before ordering. I think if I had not, I would've rated this product lower. Sad, but true. It still shocked me how many pieces arrived.<br />This product came in a relatively small box for what it was, was a great price, but definitely had NOTHING put together for me. I had to put in every. single. screw. Except in one small area on the microwave door hinge area.<br />That said, I had fair warning that I would be putting everything together, paid a low price, and the pieces fit together well. I had only two real complaints about this product:<br />1. The directions never state to screw in the top &#34;counter&#34; (the part holding the sink and burners) to the rest of the kitchen. If you don't notice this, you will have a counter that will lift easily on the left side. I used the &#34;extra&#34; screws included for this, and at the end noted that there were enough in the regular &#34;screw A&#34; area to cover this. It just wasn't listed on the directions anywhere--and I hunted for it. Hopefully newer editions of the instructions will catch this.<br />2. Plastic pieces - the plastic pieces seem cheaper than usual, although the wood seems fairly good. The silvery &#34;paint&#34; already chipped in a few places while I was putting it together, and my child hasn't even seen this present yet. But my MAIN complaint about the plastic? It is so incredibly difficult to screw anything into it!! I hated the pole at the side and the burners -- I was afraid to use any power tools for fear it would break the plastic, and I was putting all my weight into screwing it together in a more controlled manner. Grabbed my spouse when my hands started hurting and even then one screw wouldn't go all the way down. I would say the plastic is not &#34;predrilled&#34; and this is a huge problem.<br /><br />Even with the few flaws, this kitchen did go together well with very few predrill holes issues in the wood itself. It is very cute when put together, and I know my chef-inspired son will love it when he gets it for his birthday. I was increasingly pleased with the little kitchen the further I got while building it. For a moderately novice builder, I was pleased with the outcome and felt each step (excluding the missing one) was not too hard to do by myself, although it took a few days of consistent work. It does, however, require a good amount of pressure to screw in any plastic pieces, and the pole and burners required a lot more pain than was necessary.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFWJOY6NTXGQF7YFAPNK72L4TRRA,1502308133578,0,False

It took me 6 hours but it was a fantastically fun project even on Christmas Eve! It is adorable kitchen! Wow. It is made of wood with all the details you hope for! A winning little kitchen!!! I want to mention that if you like putting things together you'll LOVE doing this.

Maybe would have been less had it been a boring game.  It is definitely high quality and was not difficult to put together, just time consuming.  My daughter plays with it daily and really really loves it.  The only complaints I think I would have is that at the beginning my daughter had trouble opening some of the doors.  She has gotten better at it so its not a big problem anymore.  The other thing is that you need to supervise while the kids are playing because the corners of some of the doors are sharp.

Compartments are very small. Microwave doesn't stay closed.<br />2. I love putting together these types of projects, but the screws and amount of hardware was truly excessive.

You'll also want an electric screwdriver to save time.

824,3.0,lots of screws but its good!,"**EDIT*** so after having this little kitchen it is still adorable. Its help up pretty good to 3 (very rough) toddlers playing with it however, I hoticed today that my daughter has a screw in her mouth that had fallen out of a door from the constant opening and closing. The screw got loose and she got it, one of the tiny little screws that holds the latches on (i guess you could call it that). Im taking away a star simply for that. Its dangerous and i expected it to stay in.<br /><br />Such a cute little kitchen for my daughter(s) currently I have a 15 month old and expecting the 2nd any day now and this is the perfect height for her! Its so cute and she took right to it! You will need to buy food and cookware stuff but other than that it's adorable and amazing.<br /><br />I took away a star just because of how much there is to put together. I understand the whole minimal packaging thing, but good lord all the screws. They recommend not using a power drill however you will want to after that many screws. Some things could come pre assembled like the little flat peices you have to screw on, or the door hinges, that would be nice. I will say though the instructions are VERY easy to follow so no man should even have a problem...if they actually read :) I put this thing together 38 weeks pregnant. It was that easy but man....the screws left one raw thumb!

Certainly will last several years before he would be better off with a larger size piece, and hopefully a sibling will be along to enjoy it as well. The durability is not a question.

842,5.0,"Great product, but depends on your child's personality","This is a beautiful high quality product.  I got my daughter the one in white so as to match our own kitchen cabinets.  She received it for Christmas when she was about 1.5 years old.  She has had it for several months now.<br /><br />First, building it was a little bit difficult.  My brother who does manual labor with tools all day found it to be a bit tedious and difficult to tighten things in (like the legs) without hurting his hands from the turning of the screws.  Some of the wood split from the pressure of the screws going in.  But he built it by himself in approximately two hours, while snacking on Christmas cookies.<br /><br />I bought a bunch of food and pots and pans to go with it, and as nother Christmas gift my daughter got a table and chair set.  For Christmas morning we filled it up with the food, and the table set for a meal. Since she is too young to unwrap everything I just put big bows on it. When my daughter came down in the morning and saw it all she was amazed.<br /><br />She played with the set for a great deal the first few days, but her interest waned after awhile.  Over the past few months, the table and chairs seemed to have been a better gift for her age because she liked to sit at a table for her size and play with crayons or playdoh.  Despite the kitchen not being one of her favorite toys, I couldn't imagine not having it.  It is a nice looking piece, and has plenty of storage for fake food and other toys.<br /><br />I think as she gets older she will appreciate it more.  I wanted to get this brand because the children's museum near us has one in red and my daughter liked playing with it whenever we went there.  I suspect, that at this young age, she might have been more engaged by a kitchen set that was more colorful, and made noises and effects.  But, I think I would find a garish color or loud noises to be tiring after awhile.<br /><br />I think it was worth the investment as a standard toy for a child's collection, much like a doll house, or a swing set would be.  It is a good storage unit as well.  I know we have many years of use ahead of us, since she is almost 2 now.  It might be that playing kitchen is not very engaging for her yet.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AH5E3JNOOGH7256HEABGQ6DNWPZA,1365708199000,1,True

875,4.0,"Horrible Assembly, but Your Best Option Out There","Adorable - best looking kitchen I could find. I wanted a normal color that preferably matched our own white kitchen cabinets and one that wouldn’t be an eyesore in our home for a few years. I love the cabinet function (solid doors that open, & no battery powered features to break!), but do really wish the sink knobs turned (my son is trying really hard to turn them) and that all cabinets had a latch. Some catch a latch, others just lightly “set” on the frame when closed. Although one tiny screw from a latch on the fridge section did actually fall out almost immediately. The screws are extremely cheap quality and we had to rig one with a spacer because it wouldn’t go through the thin particle board as designed 🙄... As other reviewers state, this takes HOURS to assemble, even when you’re capable and handy. Just a ton of pieces, so don’t count on a quick turnaround time if this is a gift. Comes with a TON of extra hardware, which is always unnerving, but we had to use a number of “extra screws” when some of the intended screws were the wrong size for their intended jobs. The issue here is the extra screws don’t have white-painted caps to match the kitchen. Easily fixed with white craft paint of course. My biggest issue is that the counter is only attached with loose pegs so we will reinforce that ourselves soon as my son has managed to un-peg it a few times, creating a temporary gap with the lower cabinets. However, despite the horrible assembly process (why I deducted a star) I think it’s one of the better ones out there - I didn’t want plastic that might crack and of the plywood kits this had the most promising reviews. Glad I got it- but glad I’ll never have to assemble a play kitchen again.

It was a birthday present for my 3 yr old and she has played with it everyday since she got it a week ago. The legs are a bit flimsy, but there's 5 supports so it stands. the &#34;glass&#34; from the microwave and oven are very thin sheets of plastic. Now if we can get her to share with her 1 yr old brother!<br /><br />It does look great though and not the super plastic, although my daughter asked me to put batteries in it so it made noise (I think they had one at school!)... Had to tell her this one didn't make noise. (thank goodness!)

967,4.0,GREAT PRODUCT! Even I want to play with it but the instructions are pretty crappy!,"This is a BEAUTIFUL little kitchen. It has so many cool things that make me want to go back in time so I can play with it as a kid... but that's why I have a daughter! Now I have a great excuse to play with it :-)<br />We bought her this KidKraft kitchen, a set of pots and pans and fake food and she LOVES IT! As soon as we go downstairs in the morning, that's the first place where she will go to play so my husband and I are thrilled about buying her this.<br />The one big issue that I have is the instruction manual... I don't know about the guy who said it took him a little bit over 2 hours to build this because my husband and I did it TOGETHER and it took us around 4 - and we are both engineers. There are quite a few issues with the instructions that drive me crazy AND with the screws that come along with this set.<br />To give you a concrete example:<br />All the screws come separated and labeled for you A - Q I think. However, there are two types of A screws, two types of G, etc... WHY? Oh... well I didn't even realize that this was happening until we noticed that some of the A screws have a white topping and the others don't. Ok, that makes sense because the white ones should go in every external facing surface of the kitchen so it looks prettier. Why don't you TELL me in the instructions, to make sure I pick the white topping screws? Why don't they name those screws something else? Or why don't they make ALL the screws have a white topping?<br />I do not regret buying this at all but I do recommend that you look VERY CLOSELY at the instructions, sometimes even encourage you to jump ahead a few steps so you understand what they want you to do, and also pay attention to the top of the screw so you use the right ones.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFPJ4GQQLKYQ6PVCEO4SJ3KQLBRQ,1465243021000,2,True

1034,4.0,"Adorable, Sturdy, but instructions stink - Mind your ""R""s and ""Q""s","After 2.5hrs of 4 very capable and sober adults breaking up into teams to put this together....It turned out looking adorable. But the route to get there was annoying as hell. One reason it took so long was on our fruitless search for the &#34;Q&#34; labeled screws. The instructions called for them, but they were no where to be found. We looked and looked, and tore through every scrap of the box, and ultimately we went to our toolbench and found similar screws and applied washers, and it made a good replacement. That took one of the two teams on a 45 minute diversion. However, when it was finally assembled we strangely had two &#34;R&#34; screws leftover! You guessed it, the instructions are so poorly written an edited that what the book call Q screws, the nut/bolt package called R screws. See the picture I uploaded.<br /><br />Then there were the consistent diagrams that weren't to scale, or that left out images of holes/edges which are needed by the assembler to figure out which end is up when inserting screws.<br /><br />Lastly, it was the &#34;more is better&#34; concept of screws. There were dozens of different shapes and sizes of screws, and hundreds of pieces. If you've ever assembled IKEA, well this made IKEA look simple, and honestly IKEA is simple compared to this. IKEA has figured out a way to use 1 assembling piece for every 4 or 6 that this package contained.<br /><br />At 2:30am on Dec 23rd however, it looked adorable by the time we were finished, but it warned me off this brand of kids products to buy in the future. There is just no forethought put into the assembly process or instructions itself, and I'd rather reward a company who puts more effort in this area. The finished picture includes an extra foam-core backsplash that I attached with some multi-heart colored contact paper. Hopefully some of the toys won't fall behind and get stuck with a backsplash added.

I found the directions (all 16 pages of them) easy to follow. There are just a lot of steps.

After using this, I don't know why anyone would go with the plastic options given the price.<br /><br />I don't really have any negatives about the set, but I do think there are some drawbacks that some people may need to be aware of before purchasing.  In true IKEA-style fashion, it is &#34;flat packed&#34;, and next to nothing is preassembled.  You will be responsible for attaching every handle, every hinge, every door.  I wouldn't say any step is difficult, but it is time consuming.  Also, there are three dials that click for the oven and range, but beyond that it is all imagination.  No batteries, no electronics, no buttons to push.  It is entirely self directed play, and your child will have to use his imagination.  We actually bought a cheap little kitchen timer to put with the set.  It really just depends on what you or your child prefer as to the level of interactivity.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AHO73EUAMIPDYWO23TZDVTTLJ24A,1357754764000,0,True

That said, I agree with the reviews which said it's sometimes confusing which screws to use. You have to keep track yourself of inside versus outside as instructions don't tell you. Several of the boards were mislabeled and one was completely incorrect. Once assembled, there were 3 issues. The bottom screw into the bar holding up the microwave station would not tighten all the way, leaving it a little wiggly. The top piece for the fridge was the wrong part (received two #8 and no 5). The side piece of the microwave was too long in back. I contacted customer service via email about the boards.  After numerous back and forth emails, they are sending me a replacement for the top of the fridge. Regarding the microwave side, they said that was just how it was manufactured,  nothing can be done. She said they have this kitchen in office, and theirs is like that too. You would think that if they're aware of the issue, they would make replacement parts in the correct size.

1221,4.0,My Daughter Loves This,"My daughter loves this kitchen. Some major things to keep in mind are it takes hours to build and it needs to be fastened to the wall for safety. For the most part, it was easy to follow the instructions and put it together; it took me about four hours to build but I was watching a movie and taking breaks so you may be able to build it in two hours if you're not distracted. I did find some pieces were missing from the box but we decided not to contact the company because it wasn't necessary to complete the build (just the bracket to put in one shelf; again not necessary for us so we didn't bother). I have found after some use, the faucet has come loose and looks like it'll break off in the near future. I feel this is great way to stimulate your child's imagination and we've actually started storing my daughter's snacks in the cabinets so we can get an idea when she's getting hungry. One of our main concerns is this can tip over if standing on its own. To prevent any injuries, I've moved it against the wall and will fastened it with a wall anchor or screws. That's something to consider before giving this to your child. I also recommend buying toy pots and toy food to go with this. Hope you have a much fun with your child as we do!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+e2C5Q74L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+e2C5Q74L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+e2C5Q74L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFQ7MDZWCDDVF4NSSZKOWN4LGEUQ,1520574114028,0,True

Don't listen to what anyone has to say about the &#34;easy assembly.&#34; The product arrives, essentially, in a pile of loose parts. Look at that picture again - think it looks cute? Well, now imagine yourself putting together every little plastic piece, snapping together every wooden board, and attaching every screw. They literally assembled nothing at the factory, aside from perhaps the plastic window on the oven door and the hinge on the microwave. The toy has 35 (!!!) steps, and the manual is essentially inscrutable - on occasion, the person who wrote the directions made some useful drawing to clarify, but for the most part, you have to sit there for twenty minutes figuring out which direction to put the hinge or attempting to understand why a plastic piece has multiple holes when it only requires two screws (I've now put it together, seemingly correctly, and I still don't understand that bit of genius).<br /><br />Bottom line: it is indeed cute, and I'm sure my son will love it. But the assembly/directions are a mess. Save yourself a couple hours to put it together.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AGJCACBTYYSUF76WSVMADLZS4ILA,1482658457000,1,True

1370,5.0,Great kitchen at a great price,"My 1 1/2 yr old plays with this kitchen constantly.  It is a great size and the doors are easy for him to open and close without frustrating him.  Putting it together was definitely an undertaking.  I did it by myself and it took about 5 1/2 hours.  I probably could have done it faster but I wanted to make sure I didn't screw it up and took my time.  The instructions were easy to follow, the hardest part was figuring out exactly how the hinges should attach and not putting them on backwards.  Some of the other reviews gave hints that I thought were helpful, especially screwing in your screws to the plastic parts before you actually attach the piece.  They are not threaded and I think doing this really made things easier when you are in strange positions.  One big hiccup was at the very end, the hole for the sink was not big enough and did not fit.  I had to actually get help with this and we had to chisel out a small part to make it fit.  And even by doing that we still had to really hammer it in.  I would suggest first thing before you put anything together make sure the sink fits into the designated hole.  There was no way I was taking it all apart at that point to return it!

1379,3.0,Doesn't look as nice as pictures.,"After agonizing over which play kitchen to buy for my 1.5 year old I picked this one due to good reviews and the clean white look. I didn't want plastic and I thought this was all painted or coated wood and MDF but that's not true so it doesn't look as nice as I'd hoped. The front doors are all solid feeling and painted or coated cheap wood or particle board and looks decent except for a few dings it came with but the rest is MDF covered in laminate and it doesn't look very nice with the white because the seam around the edge shows. It's a fine line but it's a dark line so the part I'm looking down at is very cheapy looking unfortunately. I honestly wish I would've shelled out some more cash and gotten something nicer. The white one I got also cane with some light blue marks on the counter top part that won't wash off. But once you unpack even half the peices there's no way they are going back in the box so make sure you really want it before you start building.<br /><br />Other observations:<br /><br />It had a noticeable new furniture/chemical smell while building and after a few months continues to smell that way inside the cabinets as they don't air out as much.<br /><br />Make sure you have a drill just in case. At least with a screwdriver bit. Goes much faster. There are a million and one screws!<br /><br />Make sure you put the painted white screws on any bit that is facing out. They don't differentiate in the instructions and it's a pain to go back and change them.<br /><br />You get what you pay for. Honestly I'm not sure why or how this kitchen is compaired with the pottery barn one. Pottery Barn's version is almost twice the price but it's twice the nice in my opinion. The doors sound more solid and the whole thing just looks nicer. The children's musium near my house has a few peices of the pottery barn kitchen sets and it's holding up great even with constant public use. The kid kraft one seems like it would break within a week or two of such use.<br /><br />The plastics on the kid kraft kitchen are very cheap. A few months in nothing has broken, yay! I just hope it keeps going that way. Either way they are not super nice to look at.<br /><br />In conclusion I wish I would've bought something nicer that sits flush with the wall and didn't have those weird bits sticking out the back.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFYXOTAJFUJVCRYGPBUKN64R243Q,1468616410000,2,True

She had enjoyed every play kitchen she came across so we thought she'd like one at home. It took a really LONG for my husband to assemble (at least 3 hrs?). All the parts were present, but it was tedious (you've been warned). The size is on the small side. It fits my standard 2 year old just fine, but it was pretty small for a 3.5 yr old that came over to play. It didn't stop them from playing with it, but just something to keep in mind. The sink just sits in the hole designated as such, and just glue or screw in. My biggest complaint is when I went to move it across the room with barely any toys in it, I gripped under the microwave and a screw stripped through the wood, so not the sturdiest of play kitchens.

And lastly there were chips in most of the pieces and the shelf edge paint wore where the doors opened after just a couple uses. Also the shelf below the sink warped and the wood layers separated because a tiny bit of water spilled on it. It's the sink. What little kid d isn't going to try to sneak water in it?

It’s totally worth it when you see how excited your child is while playing with it, but heed my warning. Have help available or be sure to set aside plenty of time for assembly!

My 2 year old loves to open the doors and put things in and out. Upon receiving, I had already planned to spend a good amount of time assembling based on other reviews. I would compare this to assembling ikea furniture. There are many pieces and parts but if you have an electric drill, you should get done much quicker. It took me about 2 hours to assemble alone even after having to go back a couple times to fix some mistakes. There are times when the instructions are confusing, but overall they are straight forward, just time consuming. If you have the time and patience, this is the perfect play kitchen for the price. Although, I would’ve enjoyed if it included some food or pots and pans. It’s solid, sturdy, and just so cute.

1626,2.0,You Get What You Pay For,Just finished putting this together for my kids Christmas present. It was easy to put together but time consuming. You have to assemble EVERYTHING! It took me 3.5 hours and unlike some reviewers mine did not come with any hinges or anything pre-assembled. Mine was also missing the microwave turntable. The gentlemen at Amazon was nice and tried to help. After I said I would not disassemble the kitchen and ship it back they offered a $13 credit.

The quality of the materials/construction is excellent - standing up extremely well to sometimes rugged play.  And in addition to all this, I need to give special kudos to KidKraft for their customer service.  We discovered several months after purchasing this that one part (a decorative &#34;grille&#34;) had been missing from the original package - our daughter informed us of this.  Even though it was technically beyond the 90 day warrantee period, I contacted KidKraft and asked if they could send the missing piece.  Without a hitch, they immediately agreed to do so and sent the missing part at no cost to us, and it arrived three days later.  That is the kind of customer service that will build a loyal customer base!  I can't recommend these folks highly enough!!",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AGNLD6QLGJ2YBXOCHA26DKTHUNLQ,1492744280000,1,True

Given the number of pieces, there's no possible way to do it faster. I've read some reviews that suggested the door hinges were already attached.  Ours were not attached, so those customers must have received a different version of the kitchen.

He needed somewhere to put all that perishable food!<br />4) It provided enough storage space for all of his play food and dishes.<br />5) We're familiar with and confident in the quality of KidKraft, knowing that this kitchen would stand up to many years of use.<br />Though our son still hasn't gotten into pretend play yet, he does enjoy standing at the kitchen and playing by opening and closing the cabinets (which were a little tight at first), picking up the phone, turning the clicking knobs on the stove, fiddling with the faucet, and pulling things out of the fridge and pantry to inspect.

1734,5.0,Pay Attention to Details,"Don't let the negative reviews on this kitchen turn you off. It's really not that hard to put together. It only took me 2 1/2 hours to do it, and that's with making the mistake of putting it together with my two year old running around trying to help.<br /><br />Yes, there are some screws and seemingly awkward things to do to build the kitchen, but it's worth it. It is totally cute and practical- I purchased the white vintage kitchen for my little guy, and he loves cooking while I work in the kitchen. Keep this in mind while you put it together.<br /><br />Now, brace yourself. The directions are clear, but they are only pictorial directions. There are no written directions. Because of this, you need to look really closely at the directions and pay attention to which side of the board/kitchen is facing up in the picture. Most of the hinges come attached. Only one set is not, so that's helpful. Also, the screws and bolts come in a labeled cardboard bubble strip. For the love of all things, DON'T open them up until you take note of which screw is labeled with whatever letter. If you are liable to forget, get some sandwich bags and label them with a black marker and put the corresponding screw in the proper bag. You will thank yourself later.<br /><br />As to the actual putting together, I agree that it would be tons easier if the plastic pieces were threaded. However, it's just one extra step for you. DON'T try to attach the plastic pieces directly to the kitchen without first pre-screwing the screws into the legs or plastic door latch. You will be cursing within one minute if you don't take this step. Just twist the screw all the way in and remove it before you go on to the step of actually attaching it to the structure. On a side note, don't use a drill. Stick with a regular screw driver. If you use a drill with particle board, you are liable to accidentally torque the screw and over tighten it, which will cause the particle board to crack and leave you with a door that may just fall off the hinge because the board is compromised.<br /><br />These are my words of advice. Hope they helped. Oh, if you do run in to any trouble, don't hesitate to call the KidKraft help number that comes with the directions.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFBVKQB4RQSM5ZHYINHHVZKTXNRA,1317935087000,346,True

I highly recommend leaving the hinges for last. I put them on wrong at first then at the end of instructions had to flip them all around. All instructions are photos no word instructions. Some photos aren't very clear. Also other little bit of an issue is the clamps inside the doors when you close are too hard when you open and close.

The assembled product was ok but some of the boards were sticking out longer on the back than others which was an odd design. The doors closed slightly crooked, even after we adjusted the placement.

Two relatively intelligent grown adults both attempted to put this together before having their own respective emotional melt downs.  When going online to the kid craft website to attempt to order the missing parts (of which there were many), we were informed that every single missing part was somehow remarkably unavailable to order, which was somewhat unhelpful.  At this point a jacked up half put together toy kitchen is taking up space in our guest room until we decide whether to attempt to disassemble what has been already been put together to return it or to simply burn the damn thing.

1814,5.0,Perfect Play Kitchen,"I bought this for my 2-year-old's Christmas present this year. I got it a few hours ago and assembled it while also working around my very interested son. The instructions we sort of your standard unassembled furniture type of instruction so it's not too bad if you're used to that kind of stuff. All the wood and particle board pieces were labeled with numbered stickers and all the little screws and what-not were in a single package separated and labeled appropriately. The slightly more difficult part was that the plastic parts (the knobs, sink, etc.) did not have labels so you have to go off looks which for the most part isn't too bad but there are a couple pieces that look pretty similar so I made a wild guess when it came to that initially and lucked out but that would've been slightly annoying to go back and fix further on. I also appreciate that all the screw are of a good quality so you won't easily strip the screws like the ones a lot of other companies provided to save a few cents. I also noted that the wood wasn't easily messed up either like if my screwdriver slipped, there would be no scratch on the paint as immediate evidence. They have a couple screws labeled the same but they just vary by one type having a white head so if it's going to be visible, you'll want to grab those to use but others are hidden so you could just grab the regular silver ones. I didn't time how long it took me to assemble but at least a couple hours while working around a curious toddler. Everything feels pretty study and my son is already all about it. Another thing too was that when I was attaching the little KidKraft emblem on the freezer door, one of the pieces that I was supposed to screw on broke off but I was at least able to make do with using hot glue to get things in order there. I doubt you'd even know unless I told you because, like I said, it's sturdy. It's just my son's size (he's about 35"" tall), looks great, and should last for years!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R8TcsA9QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R8TcsA9QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R8TcsA9QL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fJi75xI8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fJi75xI8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fJi75xI8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFNITCO3DHWX6YZ2FASIREEUEMRQ,1575528694110,1,True

It make an Ikea real size kitchen seem like a menial task.<br /><br />As I laid out the dozens, on dozens of parts I new that it was going to be an adventure, literally, not one single hinge is assembled and there are possible over a hundred pieces of fastening hardware at a minimum. I hope, that on Christmas day when Santa drops this thing off for my daughter that she has never loved something so much because it left me not so excited about the birth of our savior, but needing a trip to the chirporator for the multiple hours spent leaning over this toy.<br /><br />Kid Craft- I beg of you, as my wife will not listen to my suggestions on almost anything - to please post some type of warning like &#34;multiple drill batteries required, ensure that you charge them over night so that you dont have to stop&#34;<br /><br />In the middle of assembly, as I was running out of water and worried that I may perish in my basement next to the litter box my wife brought me breakfast.

1824,5.0,Nice find!,"Surprisingly high quality for $80.  All the pre-drilled holes are in the right places, such that it's solid and doesn't wobble, and all the doors line up with 1/8"" tolerance.  However, assembly isn't trivial as did take me 3 hours to assemble, and some of the instructions pictures could have been larger, and they could have designated where to use painted screw heads vs. non-painted screw heads, but made some guesses and it all worked out.  One improvement suggestion is to use less secure door latches, or nethaps break off one tab. My 3 year old had difficulty opening and closing the doors without slamming, so I had to take them off.  As long as the floor is level, doors will stay closed.  I paired it with the JOYIN 135 piece play food and Cute Stone Kids pot/pan set which was the perfect size and all plastic to be drop-able (less dings in my hardwood floor).  Disassemb-able food in the Cute Stone set is very unique.  But beware that the JOYIN set is like ping-pong ball plastic so will bounce a bit on hardwood floors, mainly only a problem with the oranges are they are almost completely round so roll off, but everything else will settle. Recommend washing with dish soap, as they seemed oily out of the packaging.  Didn't want that in mouths.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BIb-7uT1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BIb-7uT1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BIb-7uT1L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AFYUCPQWVGO52D6TSBW77SSDJOTQ,1580137593398,1,True

A few pieces broke as we went along - the plastic when you screwed in the screws. There were scratches on some of the wood. The final product is overall okay but some of the screws that are very visible were not painted white. So some are silver and some are white and it was not because we accidentally used the white ones on the inside. Very inconsistent. It also feels a little wobbly. My daughter is loving this so far which is great but she is a little rough so I’m nervous about how it will hold up long term but it will be good practice to be gentle.<br /><br />One other comment that is not in regards to the quality but adds to my disappointment is the cost.

1900,4.0,2 hr max assembly for the experienced.,Got this for xmas for my daughter. Arrived nicely packaged. I was a little worried because of the comments on how long (6hrs) it took to assemble. It took me 2 hrs to pit together. I probably could have done it faster if I had a power tool and if I was not watching TV at the same time.

This item came in 500 pcs. Obviously that’s an exaggeration, but no exaggeration, this item took me almost 4 hours to put together with all the pieces and directions that were hard to read and understand.<br />This was the real reason I had to write this review. If you notice in the pictures attached, you will see that a major piece that holds the item together was manufactured incorrectly.

1932,2.0,Feet unbearable!,"Echoing some of the previous reviews, this is much to short for a toddler. Most of the kitchen went together okay (even though they are just pictures), but the legs were horrible. I used a drill with an allen wrench attachment because hand tightening was impossible. It got most of the way in then stripped the screw head. We called and they sent a replacement saying &#34;soak the screws in dish soap&#34; (not kidding). We coated the screws and used the drill again, and it worked for the one foot that was now pre-threaded (thanks to the first and only stripped screw), but the others got various ways in before stripping. I was able to move up an allen wrench size and twist the legs on (rather than using the wrench), but even that only went so far. We had to Gorilla Glue the 2 loosest feet on! Not impressed. (And yes, the feet are critical to give the bottom doors clearance so they can open without scraping the floor. In retrospect, we should have gotten a white block the size of the bottom of the kitchen board, and screwed it in through the holes drilled for the feet.

So, I was up until 3AM and still didn't finish. We explained that Santa's elves were feeling a little behind so did most of the work and asked us to help with finishing touches.

1974,4.0,adorable and gender-neutral design,"Pros: adorable and gender-neutral design, durable construction, lots of little details like stove knobs that click, and very reasonably priced.<br /><br />Cons: assembly<br /><br />We bought this kitchen for my daughter for Christmas, so it's been in use at our house for six months now. I really wanted to buy her a Pottery Barn kitchen, but didn't want to spend $500+ on it, so I settled on this as an alternative.<br /><br />Pros first: it's really cute. I didn't want a lurid pink kitchen, or one of the plastic ones. This kitchen is made of laminated mdf - so while it's not exactly solid wood construction, it's certainly nicer than the typical pink plastic kitchens you see. Assembled, it looks just like the picture.<br /><br />It seems really solidly built. It doesn't wobble, and it's held up to 6 months of fairly constant use extremely well. I was originally a bit worried about the moving pieces like the faucet (which swivels) and the faucet handles, but they've held up quite well to toddler abuse.<br /><br />This kitchen has a lot of little details like stove knobs that make clicking noises, and doors that click shut. My daughter particularly enjoys the pretend fridge water dispenser.<br /><br />Comparatively speaking, the Pottery Barn kitchen is undoubtedly of higher quality and looks nicer, but for hundreds of dollars less, this is a really cute, solidly constructed kitchen that should last the average kid many years.<br /><br />There is only really one con: assembly. I expected to have to assemble it, but seriously, you have to assemble every single little piece. Nothing comes pre-assembled. You have to put the hinges and hardware and any stickers on every door, you have to put the water dispenser on the fridge door, you have to screw in all the little clips that hold all the doors closed. It took my husband and me probably a combined 4 hours to assemble it, and my husband works in a cabinet shop. No joke. The instructions are not clear or straightforward and there are so many tiny pieces and parts. It's worth the effort, but be prepared to spend hours putting this thing together.<br /><br />Overall, we're really happy with it, and are glad we didn't despair at the assembly process and just send it back.",[],B004A2QTRC,B0C7GSH59V,AGTZOAVKDB5LGHWM7DNVECO5KIPQ,1470849233000,0,False

As long as they love it, who cares if it took a long time to build. I will say that there were white and chrome headed screws. No explanation in the instruction, but my best guess is the white headed screws are for screws visible from the exterior of the product to help conceal the screws. However, when you're building as you go, it's hard to know what screws to use. Easy fix, just make sure you read through the whole instructions first, then build. Thank you for the great product.
