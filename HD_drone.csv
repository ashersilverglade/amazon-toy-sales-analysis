0,5.0,Great for blowing leaves off a roof,"I bought this quadcopter for mostly one reason: to blow leaves off our roof. I'm not as sure-footed as I used to be, and rigging safety ropes takes a lot of time. I saw a few videos of people blowing leaves with drones, so I thought I'd get one and try it out.<br /><br />I didn't shop for features like stabilized gimbal camera or such. I just looked for the biggest most economical quadcopter with a decent reviewer rating. (Bigger is better for leaf blowing, I reasoned.) This is the one I chose, and it worked out great for my purpose.<br /><br />No it's not nearly as effective as climbing up on the roof with a leaf blower. But it did get almost all of the leaves off, with the exception of a couple of small spots. I might just wait for those to dry out and try again later.<br /><br />I made a few training flights in our backyard before actually attempting to blow the leaves. I suggest starting blowing the leaves nearest the eave first then working up the roof. That way you don't wind up with a big mountain of leaves on the edge of the roof. It's slow going. Each flight was limited by the quadcopter's battery life and only lasted about 15 minutes, and it took 4 or 5 flights to get them all. I eventually bought another battery, but I had managed to get all the leaves blown off before it arrived.<br /><br />I suggest putting the propeller guards on the quadcopter for leaf blowing. It seems there's something about the way the air flows around the quadcopter when it's near a wall that makes it tend to drift toward the wall. I crunched it a couple of times but with only minor damage. It's nice the manufacturer includes a few replacement props and guards, though I didn't need them. You might want to take those guards off flying around tall trees, because they'd easily hang on a branch.<br /><br />I didn't use the onboard camera through a device while blowing leaves. I just watched the quadcopter directly. And I kept it oriented with the front facing away from me while flying so direction control was intuitive.<br /><br />So anyway, it worked as a roof leaf blower.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AE4QO4BZ4S4DD3A2EXHUCIECTYWA,1579625166880,0,True

3,5.0,A Holy Stone Masterpiece!,"[[VIDEOID:3c39acadb44f7af0c1ae7316aabdb717]] A Holy Stone Masterpiece! I was excited to receive this bird as I own multiple drones from Holy Stone. The new HS100 is the best one yet. It is their first GPS drone and it does not dissappoint. From the premium packaging, the easy and minimal assembly and clear instructions, I had her in the air as soon as the batteries were charged. The main battery is very similar in design to the Phantom battery. It is very high quality with a USB charging plug. I wish there were two batteries included, however a coupon was included inside for a free extra battery. Get this as it will double the fun. This is the first controller I have with also a USB rechargeable battery battery. The downloadable app installed on my iPhone with no issues and quickly and easily connected to the drone. No issues at all. After the batteries were fully charged, I took them to the park and an was in the air in less than two minutes. The GPS found the satellites quickly and the calibrations were very easy. I started off in the default beginner mode which kept her close enough to let me figure out the flight controllers. Within two minutes I switched off the beginner mode and the fun started. The camera and video are OK at 720 though there are better 1080 camera drones out there in this price range if that is what you are looking for. The flight times are very good with the supplied battery as I got around 12 minutes of flight time. As an overall package, this is a very high quality, solid built, stable and beautiful looking drone that is easy and fun to fly. Highly recommended for both the beginner and advanced pilot.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91M8BeCfPvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91M8BeCfPvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91M8BeCfPvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ytOlkXt5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ytOlkXt5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ytOlkXt5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEVLNG7Y3AL5L64VNWUXREBUR5VQ,1511132550352,33,True

I used the drone about 10 more times between then and now, June 2022.<br /><br />After resetting the drone and recalibrating, replacing the software, rebooting my phone, and looking high and low for support, I own a poorly stabilized quadcopter that cannot sustain a signal to the app.  The app crashes after being connected to the drone for more than 5 seconds.  Tech support is no help, either written or phone, and there is no reasonable warranty to speak of.<br /><br />Trust me - move along.

The drone flies almost by itself, takes excellent pictures, and returns home at the press of a button.  And this thing can go high!!! My husband loves it.

23,1.0,Nothing good to say about Holy Stone,"I spent over $800 trying to save money, by buying a Holy Stone GPS FPV RC Drone HS100 for $182.27 plus $123.45 for two 15 min. batteries. $15.99 for needed spare parts, and the required FAA license. All told just over $400.<br />The HS 100 a big bulky clumsy unresponsive drone. Complex to set up, requires the hokey pokey pre fight to set up. Calibrated? If not repeat. Maybe 10 minute flight time if all goes well. Repeat the process for each battery change. Despite its size it’s unstable in mild wind, prone to lose the signal, sluggish response to the controller. After using it less than 10 times the controller died. Holy Stone’s best offer was to “Allow” me to buy a replacement Drone at full price.<br /><br /> For a few dollars more, I opted for the Mavic Mini 2, with every thing included, 2 spare batteries, charger, case, spare parts. Nothing extra needed.<br />Small enough to take anywhere with ease. No FAA License required.  No big bulky case to lug around. The actual performance difference is nothing short of astonishing.<br /><br />Mavic Mini 2’s Beautiful 4K camera that’s packed with features found in a high end DSL cameras VS HS100’s featureless 2K camera. It’s small enough to add to my EDC camera bag. With the added option of being able to use my iPad or a tablet instead of a phone.<br /><br />The Mini 2’s<br />1. Gimble is responsive & stable, no HS jitters.<br />2. Smooth, responsive, precise flight controls<br />3. No Hokey Pokey required, just turn the Mavic Mini 2 on and fly. With 24-30 min actual flight time per battery, versus HS 100’s 10 -15 min flight time.<br />4. The Mini 2 has over 10X the range of 6.2 miles over HS 100’s meager 1,000 feet. Honestly I never trusted the HS 100 more than 300 ft.<br />5. If HS100 went down out of sight was gone for good.<br />6. At 6.2 miles distances the Mavic Mini 2 low battery auto return/ land function, along with the GPS locate, with maps, light and sound alarm when you are close, is an reassuring feature.<br />7. What stands out is what started all this, Customer Service. You call DJI/Mavic you get a prompt polite rep. excited about helping you out. Their website has a multitude of downloadable PDF instructions, and videos. There are literally hundreds of YouTube videos.<br /><br />Of course you can do what I did. Buy the cheap HS-100 drone. Pay an additional $300 plus bit by bit for the necessary extras. When you want to fly more than 10- 15 minutes at a time. Then when you get frustrated with the mediocre performance, poor picture/video quality and even worst customer service. You can move up to what is universally praised as the best beginner drone made. With high end professional features later on, for essentially the same price as the HS100, when including necessary additions. Or buy once, cry once.<br /><br />A final note while both DJI (Mavic) and Holy Stone are Chinese company’s. All Mavic Drones are made in Cerritos, California providing Americans jobs. While Holy Stone’s Chinese drone are made in China. IMHO, big plus for the MAVIC MINI 2",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHNUC66O2XFL5YAUYCDZT5F2AKYQ,1673894315123,1,True
24,5.0,"This Drone handles PRETTY STRONG WINDS, even on gusty North Sea coast cliffs.","This Holystone 100 is so well made & remarkably sturdy for a mid-priced drone. We just came over to our cliff-side North Sea home, from the USA where I first learned to fly very basic drones. The winds near the cliffs, on a good day here, range from 15-30mph gusts (25-48 Km/hr). Wouldn't dare try flying any drone on a bad day; the gusts sometimes make it impossible just to stand-up!<br />So I haven't flown far over the North Sea cliffs yet, but plan to as soon as we get a pretty calm day.  I'll post the videos when I do.  Even flying around the house here, this drone has taken some strong 15-20mph winds & really held its own!  I'm no expert, but have been practicing for a year over the bays, behind our place on the New Jersey coast. This drone surprised me how well, I could control, take-off (has auto take-off speed) & direction, even with 15mph winds.<br />Haven't tried it yet with the camera, since my first goal is to become proficient flying over the North Sea cliff sides. But when I do, capturing the Puffins, Grey Seals & occasional whales on video, will be amazing. So happy my husband bought this drone last year for Christmas. Can't wait to fly it, a few yards over the North Sea cliffs & over rocks below.<br />After learning to fly two lesser quality drones,  this HOLYSTONE 100, is like driving a 750 Porche Turbo, compared to a 4 cylinder VW Bettle. I am really impressed. Glad my husband did his homework & got this Holystone 100 drone.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGGGHXEJZH3R7EH7MIGAPQJQGQDA,1556371825467,3,True

26,5.0,Great drone! Easy to setup and fly,"This was my first larger drone. Pretty simple to set up right out of the box. The directions were easy to follow and I was flying in no time. Be sure you are outside with plenty of room. I activated the auto-takeoff on my dining room table. I would suggest getting a couple extra batteries to ensure plenty of flying time. When the battery has went dead the 2 times I have flown it, I wished I had more.<br /><br />Update review 5/8/18<br />It has been a great experience thus far. I received the HS100 as a bday gift. I consider myself a somewhat experienced user and this one was the easiest drone to fly yet. As promised, an initial product review on amazon got me a new battery!  Auto takeoff and landing make it nearly fool proof. Video quality is great for 720. The VR experience makes flying the drone even easier. Due to the video transmission to the phone not always being 100%, I felt blind for brief moments and cannot risk damage or injury during those blind spots. Customer service is amazing. Shortly after I began flying the drone, i inadvertently crashed it into my deck. Before I was able to shut it down, one of the propellers hit against a vertical support of my deck, broke, and continued to try to rotate. Unfortunately this mishap caused a plastic propeller drive gear to get stripped out. I was unable to find a schematic of the assembly to attempt to troubleshoot the issue, so i disassembled the unit. I watched the brief video on replacing a motor and assumed this would be similar. Even with the piece in hand I wasn’t able to identity what I needed to order to repair it. I sent an email and message through Facebook messenger. I was greeted with an automated message advising a representative would be with me within 24 hours. Andy replied within 2 hours of my request. With only 1 question and he identified the part and arranged a couple new gears to be sent my way. Within a couple days i got the part and was flying again.<br /><br />Updated user experience.<br />Last night had had the drone out for a usual Monday evening flight. I have gotten more courageous in my flying endeavors and have turned up the speed for quicker response. A small wind gust caused me to over correct and and fly it into a tree. The drone immediately shut itself down when it hit the tree. The worst part was that it fell out of the tree, roughly 10 feet into some shallow water. The drone was still lit up when I retrieved it. I immediately powered off the drone and brought it home to inspect for damage. The camera had came off and was floating in the water. I discovered a small crack in the plastic housing, the rotating bracket that held the camera was hyperextended nearly out of it original placement. With some force I was able to get it back into place. I then started the tedious process of dismantling the drone to remove all aspects of water. I removed the propellers, landing gear, propeller guards, motor guards, and all of the body screws to open the body. I used compressed air to forced the residual water out of every crack, crevice, and underneath all of the boards. I then left the drone open to air for a little over 24 hours.<br />The battery that was in the drone at the time of the crash was exposed to water, so I put it in some rice to hopefully absorb any moisture that could have entered the battery. Once I was confident the drone had dried fully, I begun the process of reassembling it. I used the styrofoam packaging in the box for support as I put it back together. Before I completed full reassembly, powered up the drone to verify functionality. I didn’t reattach the blade guards or the lower motor covers in case i had to take it back apart. As suspected, the camera was damaged from the fall but did not have water inside the lens. Due to the impact manual rotation via the controller is no longer an option. The camera tries to rotate, but clearly audible noises are heard as it tries to move. Video still transmits clearly from the unit and flying appears to be normal. I was a little nervous to fly after the crash, I performed some general maneuvers, landed and took off and flew up to 150’ altitude with no issues. Hoping this crash only paralyzed the camera. I can live with that!<br /><br />Happy flying!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zt7E2LmcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zt7E2LmcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zt7E2LmcL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AH5NWBR4ADJYXOFUI3FWZYXFE7MQ,1522624269769,0,True

Don’t buy this for beginners ScharkSpark instead!,"So far after going through a tricky process dealing with microscopic size screws I needed a magnifying glass to use to screw the locking ring onto the motor shaft. Now I know what collapsible units are better. This is NOT a beginner unit unless you live on a large flat farm with excellent GPS signal. I live in a suburb of Central Florida and we SHOULD HAVE perfect GPS signals. Each time you turn it on, you need to pair it, then go through this three step process of holding the unit while turning in circles while holding the drone in order to set the gimbles. Why? Don’t know what I think it’s stupid to do more than once unless you’re in a different location. Then I had to go outside to finally get the unit to find a weak GPS signal. The GPS feature is why I bought this unit! Then after all that I hit the one button take off, and it flew sideways and crashed into the side of my house. I tried a SharkSparc drone which came assembled, is much smaller, but has two cameras. Out of the box after charging it flew perfectly. It doesn’t have GPS or auto return. However the video and still photos were excellent! I’ll revise this after I take more time and if it still is this frustrating, it’s going back to Amazon with a final review of both the product and the seller. For $229 there are several other brands with similar features I could have bought.  Can’t afford an DJI even moderately priced unit with same features.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF2NDCB5HLWYEC76MB4ZKFJGRLTA,1558829909379,2,True
29,5.0,Simple to learn to and fly.,I have flown the small indoor drones for a couple of years but never got accustomed to controlling it with my iPhone. I did fly it outdoors a few times but there couldn't be any wind to maintain control.<br />So after reading the Amazon reviews and watching several You Tube videos I decided that this would be the drone for me. After a few practice flights in my backyard I felt very comfortable controlling the drone. I'm glad that I also purchased a spare battery to achieve more flying time. I live a block away from a large park and try to get over there almost every day. Many people stop and compliment me about my ability to fly the drone but don't know how easy it is to fly. There are many trees at one end of the park so my next challenge is to fly between and around the trees.<br />If you're shopping for your first drone this is a good one to start with.,[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHMF2AHN5BUKUZWRUILQRAX34FRQ,1527649826411,0,True

40,4.0,Economic Entry Level Drone,"[[VIDEOID:4214b83067c61c02307ea0e7fa15fc68]] This is a fantastic entry level drone.  I have piloted tons of RC aircraft into trees over the years (including this one), and the HS100 is the easiest aircraft I've ever flown (this time avoiding the trees).  I was instantly impressed with how well it maintained position even with 8-10 mph winds.  The auto-launch/land is a handy function to prevent damage to the drone.  The picture quality is not bad, I was able to take moving pictures from about 30 ft in the air while moving at a decent resolution.  While maneuvering at fast speeds the video becomes a little choppy but that is kind of expected.<br /><br />I generally impressed with this drone, but it does have its flaws.  The battery charge time is 5 hrs and the flight time is 15 minutes max.  This makes extra batteries a major necessity.  A personal issue I have with this drone is limited portability.  The propellers mount to the motors using a microscopic screw and cap.  This limits my desire to take it places in fear of losing the prop screws.  As of right now, I just leave the propellers on and hope I don't break a prop in transit.<br /><br />There's a chance it's my phone, but I noticed the video feedback is laggy and difficult to pilot with updates every 3 seconds.  Also if the feed lags it saves lagged (notice the jump in the footage skips).<br /><br />Overall, Holy Stone has constructed a nice piece of tech, and I would happily recommend this drone to anyone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XJn6Rp2IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XJn6Rp2IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XJn6Rp2IL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lk9zSeQcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lk9zSeQcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lk9zSeQcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGLGBVUHH7ODVECZMI7EJ7TH5NJA,1532524593211,0,False

He's really hard to buy for and we didn't want to do the usual gift card - go buy something for yourself thing. My sister suggested a drone since Dad was a Navy pilot back in the day. He's not very technically savvy, so we wanted something that would have some semi-autonomous features like auto-takeoff and land, return to home, gyro stabilization, etc. We were a little concerned that at under $250 this model might not have the stability and ease of operation that we were looking for. However, we ordered it, charged it and assembled it without very much fanfare. The manual does have some Chenglish that you have to overcome, but isn't too bad - I've seen much worse.<br />We took it to a wide open field for a test before giving it to Dad - so that we could make sure it worked properly and to ""train the trainers"" so that we could get him going. We first tried the auto take-off, and were amazed that - even with a slight variable breeze, the drone rose to around 5 feet and settled into a very stable hover - even with the breeze! Within 10 minutes, we were very comfortable navigating - and are all thrilled to see Dad trying out his new toy.

47,1.0,DO NOT BUY - HAVE PURCHASED TWO OF THESE - READ REVIEW IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY - WE ARE OUT $250,"We purchased this Holy Stone HS100 as a 2019 Christmas gift for an older, smart, coordinated, calm teen. He enjoyed it for a dozen or so runs, until in inexplicably fell straight from the sky, without prior warning. Luckily, he saw it and retrieved it, and it was within 30 days purchase, so we could return it. I debated whether or not to purchase another brand, given the fact that this model lasted just a few hours. In his excitement to use this, He had already purchased two extra batteries (at $40 each), so our returning it meant he would be out the $80. So, I re-read the glowing reviews, took the plunge, and decided to reorder the same model. By this time, the price had increased $40. I asked the company if they could price-match, since the drone had to be returned through no fault of ours. They said they could not, but that they could offer us another spare $40 battery. Ugh. Tough choice, but my son liked the model, had the two batteries, so I went ahead and repurchased. He used the second model for less than two hours total when it flew off to Neverland when the ""Return to Home"" function did not work. We are now out $250. [$170 purchase price + $80 two spare batteries] That adds up to $62.50 an hour and no drone to show for it. This is not calculating the cost of my time in returning the first drone, sending several emails to Holy Stone company, pouring over reviews, or scouring our neighborhood and woods for several hours hoping to find it so we could return it.<br />Note: Oh, and the additional battery the company was going to send, in lieu of price match, has not arrived.<br />Pros: Looks nice when your take it out of the box and admire it flying up, up and away.<br />Cons: RTH function did not work.<br />Cons: Battery life was not 18 minutes, hence extra batteries needed.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEKOB67JHLIBVFSJSNW5AKJTXXIA,1581520921248,12,True

51,5.0,Great Features and Value At This Price Point,"I’ve been wanting a drone for several years just to play around with but never could really justify spending the amount of $$$ for the features and video quality I wanted. I was just window shopping through Amazon at drones when I came across the HS100. For someone that was just going to use it once in a while, the $200 price of it was my limit for what for me was essentially a toy. What caught my eye was the HD 1920 / 1080P camera. That was the minimum quality I’d be happy with.<br /><br />This does require a learning curve to know what all the options available are and flying it while using those options.  I HIGHLY recommend that you keep it in beginners mode and fly in a wide open area with few obstacles so that you can learn flying it comfortably without worrying about crashing it into something or getting out of your line of sight.<br /><br />The flying time battery life being &lt;15 minutes is disappointing, but otherwise it is a great drone for $200.  I wish I had seen the 20% discount on an extra battery when I purchased it, I likely would have got one at the reduced price. The cost of an additional battery seems to be too expensive at regular price, so I don’t think I’ll be getting one which ultimately means I’ll end up flying it a lot less often because of the short amount of flying time in relation to how long it takes to charge the battery.<br /><br />I was however immensely impressed that the box came with a full 2nd set of propellers, screws & washers, and motor drive gears. That is awesome.<br /><br />Bottom line is if you’d be an occasional user and 12 to 15 minutes of flying time (with just the one battery) is ok with you, this is a great little drone. The manufacturer (Holy Stone) seems to be a good quality business that wants its customers to enjoy the product.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHOYFHKM6FEQ3WETEJX4GEUI6QRA,1568424849584,0,True

61,5.0,Size + Sophistication + Patience = New-found FUN!!!,"I ordered my HS100 on a Wednesday and it delivered three business days later. Excellent delivery service.  The packaging was typical Holy Stone excellence.  All parts were in the box and perfectly wrapped & secured. (It did take a minute to locate the included two sets of props - they are in a recess on the bottom of the styrofoam parts carrier).<br /><br />I studied the Users Manual for an evening and read the Holy Stone user groups comments on the HS100 before taking flight for the first time. This was time very well spent.  I have a friend who is a professional drone pilot photographer and got a little one-on-one coaching from him.  INFORMATION BEFORE YOU FLY is important for any aircraft but especially for your first &#34;upper end&#34; aircraft.<br /><br />I have other drones but this is by far the largest and most sophisticated drone in my hanger.  It is impressive, it is strong, and it is big compared to my others. I am respecting its power, weight, and size until I get a &#34;hands feel&#34; for the aircraft.<br /><br />The HS100 drone is powerful, especially compared to my first HS drone, the f181 (which remains my &#34;go-to&#34; favorite if I just want to take a few laps around the neighborhood).  The '100 is smooth to fly and the auto-land works beautifully.  Really have not had many initial problems other than having to wait a very long time to recharge the drone battery.<br /><br />I now have six flights with my HS100 in the first five days.  For these first flights I elected to not connect the WiFi system, preferring to concentrate on just bare bones flying at first.  I am a long-time pilot of both real aircraft and RC aircraft. It's easier for me to first understand the &#34;stick & rudder&#34; traits of an unfamiliar craft before learning the &#34;accessories&#34; of the craft.  I'm a &#34;Basics First&#34; type of pilot.<br /><br />NOTE!!!  It is critically important to go through the initial calibration steps listed in the Manual.  You will NOT fly until you do these tasks. Do the steps, period!  Understand why they are necessary. This is a MUST-DO and only takes a very few minutes.<br /><br />I will connect WiFi today, weather permitting.  I have not flown FPV on anything yet unless I was sitting in the cockpit.  Looking forward to seeing what the drone sees!<br /><br />The airborne battery pack takes awhile to charge but it charges smoothly...no heat, no problems other than 2-3 hours to replenish.  I would definitely like an additional battery. In the HS100 box is a coupon for a second battery.  I will pursue that today.<br /><br />The Controller is very comfortable to hold and recharges relatively quickly.  A future option might be the ability to replace the rechargeable LiPo's in the controller with AA-cells so you could be back in the air in a couple of minutes but this would actually predicate on having an extra Drone battery already charged and at the ready.<br /><br />These are my initial thoughts and first report.  After I have a few flights with the WiFi system I will file an updated report.  So far, so good.  &#34;Patience&#34; is the keyword for me now.  Who says you can't teach a 70-year-old real pilot and radio-control airplane pilot how to fly a drone?<br /><br />My initial rating is Five Stars, based on Four Stars for the drone out of the box but with a bonus Fifth Star for the splendid Customer Service folks at Holy Stone.  There are a couple of bugs that I expect will be worked out with future software updates but I would indeed expect fine-tuning to occur on a brand new model as it moves forward. I cannot fairly ding them for those initial little bugs as long as they continue to work them out. I think Holy Stone definitely has a potential winner here.<br /><br />HAPPY and SAFE FLYING!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHYXRH56ZRQW7YEKAMZQKIAIG63Q,1512404209776,88,True

63,4.0,This is a nice Drone - long review and suggestions.,"I have not flown a Drone before – I hope ‘drone’ is the right term. However, I have flown fly-bar-less full axis R/C helicopters, very aerobatic, using 6S, 4500mah batteries and I fly aerobatic airplanes, 10S batteries, almost daily. Point is, I’m not new to R/C but am new to FVP drones. As such, I never take my eyes off the plane / helicopter when flying R/C and it was very difficult to take my eyes off the drone when flying – just a habit for me. Once I figured out the HS100 would be in the same place if I took my eyes off it, which allowed me to look at my cell phone screen, seeing what the camera ‘sees’ it was a whole new experience for me. Quite interesting! After the first flight I took it off the “beginner” mode as it was stable, but responds quickly (QUICKLY) to any stick input on the transmitter – SO MOVE THE STICKS SLOWLY if you are an inexperienced flyer. This is one area I’d like to see improved – the more expensive transmitters have what’s called Dual Rates, allowing you to set the response of control surfaces (how has the plane / Heli responds to stick movements) allowing for smooth flight, or 3D type flying. I think it would be a simple software modification for the future allowing a variable rate (programmed by the user) or a 50% fixed rate of the ‘normal’ response to stick movement. Also, when flying R/C the left stick is not centered like this one, but it was not hard to get use to, and I think a good idea for this class of Drone. Push up, the Drone ascends, pull down, the Drone descends – simple enough.<br /><br />My assembly – straight forward but I had one screw out of 8, holding the blade guards in place where the plastic was ‘stripped / too large’ for the screw – no, I did not over-tighten, it was this way, but easily fixed. The extra parts provided are a nice tough too. The binding was simple; the calibration was a bit difficult for me to understand as I have not done this before. The text on the cell phone told me just what to do, but in the 2nd stage of calibration, it was unclear to me if I was to hold the Drone upside down, or at right angles to the ground. Perhaps changing the wording to “point the camera at the ground and rotate your body in a circle” would be easier to understand? YouTube cleared this up.<br /><br />I was a bit paranoid about the power up sequence, unsure when the Drone is actually Armed and ready to fly – but the screen on the cell phone tells you this – which is great – and I’ll assume the power to the motors are disabled until the screen tells you the Drone is “ready to fly”.  On my other RC models I have an “arming plug” and once this is plugged it, I know the plane is ready to go! I am so use to this arming plug it was uncomfortable for me to power on the Tx and drone and then start moving the sticks – for instance in Binding – move the left stick forward and backwards to start the binding sequence. Scary for me as the drone and Tx have power at that time – but not to worry, no issues, all worked fine. I never had the drone ‘active’ with blades turning when I was not ready.<br /><br />Having flown R/C with LiPo batteries for 15+ years, I would like to stress this is nothing to play around with. It can be very dangerous – and cause fires. READ THE YELLOW CAUTIONS PAPER that comes with the HS100. I read about one person who states the batteries caught fire – but I’m pretty sure this person left the USB charger (you provide – not included in the package) on at 2A, or was charging over 2A (WHICH YOU ARE TOLD NOT TO DO!!!!)… the caution specifically states NOT TO KEEP THE BATTERIES CHARGING – and you MUST MONITOR THIS. Yes, you will forget at some point, and you may be lucky, but if the USB charger keeps charging when the cells are charged, overcharging might occur. This is my next area of recommendation for Holy Stone – spend a little more money have provide a charger that monitors and charges the batteries the 7.4V pack (2 cells), then shuts OFF. WE KNOW PEOPLE WILL FORGET, WE KNOW THIS!!  You’ll note the USB is 5V and there is no way to charge 2 cells (at the same time) to 7.4V battery from a 5V source. So, the charger must charge one cell at a time and when the 1st cell is charged to some predetermined level, like 4.1V (4.2 would be ideal) then some circuitry must note this and then the 2nd cell starts to charge. The question becomes, what happens when the 2nd cell is charged? What happens if the 2nd cell is only partially charged? This may cause a problem as the current will be taken from both cells and the lower cell will discharge faster than the fully charged cell. Your are specifically told “Make sure to remove the batteries from the charger after charging is complete”, so I’ll assume the USB charger keeps pumping current into the battery – at some reduced current, but overnight charging is NOT RECOMMENDED – and can be dangerous!!<br /><br />Like others have reported, is the black dot you see on the video when looking into the sun. Never seen this before from a camera, but this camera has this problem. While not a huge issue as any video looking toward the sun is not good quality anyway, it would be nice to remove this issue.<br /><br />I am just starting to fly this drone and have not tried the ‘follow me’ mode or other features, but plan to give it a good test in the coming weeks. Also, I can’t compare this model to others as I have not flown drones before, but I think for the price, it’s a decent starting point for those that want GPS. If not, a cheaper version, the HS300 does not have GPS but looks like a good started Drone also.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AH6LKWPBCDE56W5J5AN53323QJDA,1513556983530,1,False
64,5.0,Easy to use,I purchased this product as a drone beginner . I have never flown a drone before but I have to say that this product is very easy to fly and is easy to learn how to control . The device has propellor guards which also help balance the drone in high winds and prevent crashes for new users. I bought this drone for photography and the camera is very crisp and clear. I like that it has a gps feature to return to you if it gets out of range and the follow me feature which hovers and follows you as you walk .

84,4.0,Nice Flying GPS Drone,"I was excited to see this was a GPS drone :-)  I like that it has the ability to set the max distance and altitude along with the height using the App. It will return to the exact spot where it took off from  when RTH is activated either automatically or when you press the home button. The snap in battery makes it so easy when it is time to install or remove it.  I was able to fly out about 600ft and reached a speed between 15 and 20mph which is good when fighting a light wind. The GPS held position very well which helps when trying to video and not worry if it will drift away.  The app works very well and also keeps track of your flights showing max height, speed and distance. They give you enough spare parts should you need them. I would suggest getting an extra battery so you can stay out longer when flying between charging.  I will try to post  some videos  later so you can see the quality of the camera.  Photos and Video can be started or stopped from the controller or the app. Both the controller and flight battery are rechargeable which is nice so you don't have to keep buying batteries.  Also I did want to mention that the app has a selection for VR which takes the screen and turns it into 2 so if you want to place your phone into a set of VR goggles you will feel like you are inside your drone looking down.  I have touched on many positive points of this drone and sure my Granddaughter is going to love it :-)  If anyone has any questions please write and I will try to answer what I can.  I have been flying drones and planes for many years.

85,5.0,"Fun and Easy to fly, right out of the box","[[VIDEOID:6bd4c54a62b81b647b09f2d7d47fabef]] I consider myself a beginner when it comes to drones. My first drone was an HS110 which I liked a lot.<br /><br />I decided to try a more advanced drone, and purchased an HS100 GPS. When I opened the box, I found the drone, extra guards and props, memory card, usb reader, as well as a screwdriver, screws and washers, and directions. It even included a nice branded notepad with pen, I suppose for logging my flights.<br /><br />When I followed them step by step, it appeared as if it didn’t pair correctly. Then I watched a youtube video, and learned that I needed to do a compass calibration before it would pair. No big deal.<br /><br />After I got it paired, I decided to start my first flight. There was a slight breeze that day, and the first thing I noticed is how well it maintained it’s position and altitude. I have a lot of trees around my house, so I was flying conservatively. Surprisingly, it was very easy to navigate around all the obstacles especially in the light wind.<br /><br />I recorded a couple flights, and was really impressed with the camera quality. I also liked the fact that I could remotely pivot the camera so it shoots directly under the drone while flying.<br /><br />Overall I’m really impressed with the quality of this drone, as well as how easy it was to fly.

My daughter knew I was contemplating buying a drone but hesitant because I’m not very skilled at remote aircraft. She got me this one for my Bday after researching drones. The first flight was amazingly simple this isn’t a drone that would crash easily. It flys super stabil and very controllable. I’ve tried both headless mode and regular and they both work well. First flight I used the geofence to keep it close by. Very cool that when battery is almost drained it comes back. The auto takeoff and landing is a very nice feature. The biggest setback isn’t the drone it’s the iPhone screen in the sun. That’s not HS fault for sure. The altitude pics from the 2k camera are very cool. Overall I’m very impressed and it was money well spent. It’s something I can actually enjoy because it is so easy to fly and not stressful. I want to enjoy doing something and not stress out about it. A friend who saw a Facebook post about my first flight ordered one that day!

101,5.0,"This is a lot of drone for the money, fun and easy to fly","[[VIDEOID:e2ec8c1f707c1ce68fa649790539c974]] The GPS mode keeps the HS100 stable in flight and gives you some insurance it will return back to the take off point if signal is lost or the battery runs low. Release the sticks and this thing will hover where it is without any help. All the parts and spare parts were in the box and the manual is easily readable. The phone app lets you dial in max altitude and range, for a little added safety. The response speed is adjustable so you do not need lightening reflexes for control. Be sure you register it at the official FAA web site, as a recreational small UAS, it costs $5 for 3 years. There are other sites that try to look like the FAA site and want way more than $5.<br />I do recommend the FAA's B4UFLY phone app. This app will let you be aware of any flight restrictions in your area. Fly safe and have fun!<br />Note: you need to do a short calibration procedure for the compass if in a different location, it is in the manual and takes about 10 seconds. Without GPS this is not easy to fly. Read the manual and check the LEDs to be sure you have GPS reception.<br />The camera can support a micro SD memory card up to 32 GB with a FAT or FAT32 format. I purchased this one [[ASIN:B010Q57T02 SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC UHS-I Card with Adapter, Grey/Red, Standard Packaging (SDSQUNC-032G-GN6MA)]] and it worked without any need to format it, it came as FAT32.<br />A spare battery or two are worth while investments. Let the HS-100 cool about 10 minutes before inserting a new battery.<br />I have included a short video taken between 20 and 60 feet in altitude. The winds were 5 mph gusting to 10. This is from the first time I took this up to try filming.<br />By the way, this will fly perfectly well without a WiFi phone connected. It can record to the internal camera memory card. I have started flying it without the phone, mainly because the WiFi cuts off (at about 120 Meters ) way before the maximum controller range (at about 500 Meters) is reached, that and the controller is just easier to hold without a phone stuck to the top. Just be sure you understand what the LED light mean with the different flashing patterns. You should not have any flashing LEDs at take off.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEQ4XXSZ4AHG4RQDIR74QRL5HEVQ,1519212698364,22,True

Return to home feature works well (give or take a few feet) so make sure you have a good amount of room to compensate for any variations in landing.  The battery life is as the documentation states - about 15 minutes.  I recommend picking up a 2nd or 3rd battery just to maximize your fly time.

132,4.0,Very good drone but poor battery performance (only getting 10 minutes when should be 18),"This is my first drone. I’ve flown RC Helicopters and airplanes before. I purchased this particular model because it is larger and heavier than most and I wanted a drone that could hopefully resist the wind where I live. After reading the manual I found the drone easy to assemble (have to attach landing gear and camera), charged transmitter & drone batteries, turned on transmitter and drone, paired them, calibrated the compass (be sure to read the instructions carefully about how to do this as I got it wrong first time) and gyro, then let it find GPS satellites (can take a minute or so).<br />First few flights went well as I grew more comfortable and flew higher and further, though I did experience a few crashes and hard landings due to operator error/inexperience! I stayed in Beginner’s Mode to start with then set maximum distance to 100’ (30m) and maximum height to 50’ (15m) for now. I avoid windy days or flying where there were people, cars, buildings, trees, etc. until I feel more confident about not crashing!<br />I bought a 32GB TF card so I could take photos and record videos on it and transfer to my PC. Then I downloaded the app, installed it on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy s7) and connected to drone via Wi-Fi so I could see what it was doing and record videos that way. Worked just fine. Good video quality but a bit shaky when drone is fighting wind.<br />After visiting some Facebook groups I learned about an app called UAV Forecast which recommends if its safe to fly based on Kp index, availability of satellites, wind, etc.<br />I have not yet tried RTH feature as I’m not sure I understand how it is supposed work. I want to wait until I have more open space and less wind to try it. Same with Follow Me.<br />Flight time is limited to about 10 minutes with the included 3500mAh battery (NOT the 15-18 minutes claimed by manufacturer unless that is for no maneuvers or fighting wind, etc.) so I’ll be getting another soon*. I already bought a spare set of propellers and landing gear as use so far and a few crashes has beaten up the originals quite a bit!<br />Note that due to the size and weight (26oz) of this drone I had to register it with the FAA, which was quick and easy ($5 for 3 years). I live within 5 miles of a medium airport which is Class D controlled airspace so am limited to 400’ altitude. I doubt I’ll ever have the confidence to go that high. 100’ perhaps. Also, drone flyers must get a TRUST certificate from the FAA. It is a quick and easy test.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm only getting flying time of about 10 minutes at best from this supposedly updated, intelligent 3500mAh battery that manufacturer claims should give 18 minutes of flight time. So I'm only getting just over half of that! Drone goes into low battery Return To Home mode after about 10 minutes. I always make sure it is fully charged (all four blue lights solid).

141,4.0,"Very tech advanced, and fun","My brother got me the hubsan x4 for Christmas and I loved it. I bought him this drone for his birthday in July and I would say it's amazing drone. Only ""comparison"" is that this one is slightly bigger, and more tech driven with the wifi app. But this means it drains battery faster than hubsan x4. Not disappointed but the battery life is way different. Hubsan x4 runs about 180 and this one about 220. If you want 20 minutes of flight time, with old fashion remote controller go with hubsan, if you want to fit in with the big boys and ""look"" like you have a 1500 drone, buy this holy stone.

142,4.0,"Very tech advanced, and fun","My brother got me the hubsan x4 for Christmas and I loved it. I bought him this drone for his birthday in July and I would say it's amazing drone. Only ""comparison"" is that this one is slightly bigger, and more tech driven with the wifi app. But this means it drains battery faster than hubsan x4. Not disappointed but the battery life is way different. Hubsan x4 runs about 180 and this one about 220.

154,5.0,"Very impressive GPS features, but disappointing Video Quality.","[[VIDEOID:e7e26a04dc0919f11e4414591fda1636]] I've really wanted a video drone for a long time and finally decided to buy the Holy Stone HS100 drone on Prime Day. I felt the price point was enticing enough to give it a try. I was very surprised at the sophistication of this drone. I spent about an hour assembling it. There isn't anything cheap about it. I felt that I got my money's worth alone on the flyability of this drone. It works great with the phone app. The GPS feature is really great for having a simple one-button touch to both launch and land the drone. It's fast too. I found the maneuverability to be very responsive. My concern with the GPS is that you need a strong signal to connect your phone to the drone. I was in a large field and had to walk around a bit to find an area with a strong GPS signal. I was a bit disappointed with the quality of video from this drone. I expected the 1080P HD camera to have a lot more detail. Instead, a lot of colors just blended in together. I felt the best looking video was that of things that were far off in the distance. Another concern was that the video was recorded in a .avi format. I'm a Mac user and can't view .avi. It's a Windows-exclusive video format. Yes, there are conversion apps out there, but it's another time and monetary expense to view the files. While the video did concern me, I did have to remind myself that this is not a professional video drone. And because of that I didn't take any points off. The video I get is blotchy, but still viewable. I did call support and they were quick to answer my questions and listen to my concerns. Also, Holy Stone offers a free battery for giving an Amazon review. That's a $40 savings right there...and a nice value-added reason for buying this drone. Bottom line, it's a feature-rich drone that has some impressive GPS qualities, but the video is not true high-definition quality. I would think this best for a teen who might be a budding video enthusiast. I'll use it a lot, but I'll keep my expectations low for the quality of video. All in all it's a good choice for a starter video drone.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHF5D6ZMCIDGGCJUQQCFQLNE362Q,1567786702676,0,True

The strong motors allow it to fly well on windy days, and the GPS keeps it from getting away from you.<br />Incredibly easy learning curve for a beginner... like myself! Just remember to recalibrate it before your flight... which takes less than a minute.<br />The 720p camera is clear and crisp, for about double the price I could've gotten a 1080p version; like I said I wanted to keep the price low for my 1st. drone.<br />This drone is quite rugged, and has survived a few hard landings without damage.<br />I have experienced no issues with the drone.

160,5.0,A good GPS drone!,"What an amazing drone!  Let me just say if you are in the market for a GPS drone but don't want to pay the high cost of a DJI, get this one.  Flying this drone is quite fun.  The GPS functions do work but they are not the most precise.  The return home will make the drone come back to its original take off within 5 feet (not too bad I guess).  The follow me is similar, it does keep up with your movements though it can be a bit jerky (sudden stops).  I ran 30 feet and the drone did fairly well in keeping up with me only to have a sudden stop.  In a low wind environment, the drone can hold its position quite well.  The remote feels fairly good in your hands.  You will need to charge the remote just like with the DJI's.  When you are attaching the blades, get a magnetic screw driver as it will save you so much time and anger.  You have to screw in 4 screws to secure the blades and they are really small.  Having the phone holder in the remote is a clever idea, it does come at a cost.  If you got a larger/thicker phone, you may run into issues for mounting it.  Perhaps HolyStone can make another remote or an add on for larger/thicker phones.  The phone app is fairly easy to use but it does have some connections for video feed.  HolyStone is making updates for the app which is making it better and more stable. I love the modular battery as it makes battery installation and removal easy.  Also it charges with a micro usb cable which is very nice.  Keep up the good work HolyStone!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEPRMHAF2QOMPHJRZDVV4YCTUFKQ,1512346472583,0,True

175,5.0,"Fell out of the sky, Holy Stone Replaced!","(Update)<br />After Holy Stone read me review, without me even asking they contacted me and offered to replace my drone. I'm so happy for the opportunity to return to flying. Holy Stone is an amazing company with exceptional customer service.<br /><br />(Original)<br />I was so excited to get my Holy Stone HS100-2k with GPS and fly it. I've owned a few Holy Stone quadcopters in the past and had always been pleased with them. I read the instructions and set out for my first flight. I was off and flying, the drone seemed to handle well enough for the price point and the video streaming was smooth even though my cell phone (Pixel 3XL) did not fit in the remote control's phone holder.<br /><br />While flying I pressed the land button on accident and attempted to accelerate up to cancel out of it. This didn't seem to work so I pressed the land button again still nothing as the drone continued to descend. So I pressed the landing button again and held it hoping that would cancel the landing. This shut off the motors completely while I was around 50 feet in the air. I watched in horror as my quad tumbled out of the sky in complete shock. Turns out after if you look on page 22 of the instructions holding the one key landing button for 2 seconds will stop the motors immediately and the drone will fall! Needless to say I was not impressed with this functionality at all and even less impressed that it was on page 22 and not in bold or red to stand out.<br /><br />I glued the quad back together and attempted to fly it again the next day, GPS synced and camera still worked. Pressed the one button take off button and the motor on the arm that broke off did not turn. I attempted this a few times and manually turned the propeller, no binding everything turned freely. The motor acted like it wasn't getting power. I took the motor cover off, powered the drone on in headless mode and used a multimeter to measured for a voltage on the power wires to the motor while pressing the take off button. Nothing.<br /><br />Long story short I opened the drone completely up and checked the MOSFET that is used to turn the non responsive motor on. Turns out the MOSFET's failed, the forward voltage between the gate and source according to the manufacture's datasheet should be 0.7V min, 1.2V typical, and 1.7V max. The three working MOSFETs all measured around between 1.05-1.2V with the failed one not turning on at all. If you want an exact replacement, they are FNK08N03D n-channel mosfets, they are a special order part and I should have it in 15-25 days :(","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815EyAOvwnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815EyAOvwnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815EyAOvwnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cMzUjgMeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cMzUjgMeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cMzUjgMeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGLBM5V6W4INMXIQALYB7NZZMNBQ,1607199334668,0,True
176,5.0,All the bells and whistles,"The HS100 has everything! HolyStone left nothing out when designing the HS100. It has a very stable GPS positioning system which allows it to remain steady even in moderate wind speeds. That same GPS system will return the drone back to its point of take off so there is no worry that it will fly away.<br /><br />The smart battery features a low voltage return to home failsafe. It can be charged by any standard cell phone charging usb. You can even use a portable power bank to recharge the battery.<br /><br />The controller is also a first for HolyStone and features a internal rechargeable lipo battery. No more AA batteries to purchase seperately.<br /><br />The APP is very user friendly and allows for live distance, height and speed readings. Other APP functions include a beginner mode which is on by default and keeps the drone within 30m until you are confortable. Great for beginners!<br /><br />HolyStone thought of everything and its all in the box for you.

When it arrived from Amazon, my husband couldn't believe it! What a cool gift!  He was so excited to put the unit together and try it out. It took him about 20 minutes to assemble the blades and protectors out of the box and was ready to fly. Loading the HS GPS Pro app was easy. Sinking to the wi-fi was simple and communication was very easy. He had a little trouble sinking the GPS, but once that was orientated, the HS100 was ready to fly. He marked his controller with the left and right, up and down, forward and backward, turn left and right before he brought the unit outside to fly. He also hooked a lanyard, which he had from a convention, to the controller so he could keep it level in front of him. It was starting to become dusk, so viewing the lights from the unit and the battery was really cool looking. When he started the motors, our two dogs, a Shetland Sheepdog and Poodle/Terrier mix, came out of nowhere to view the sight too! Hovering first just a few feet off the ground, he controlled the unit straight up to what we guessed to be around 250 feet.

One of my objectives was to get one not too complicated, but not too simple either.<br /><br />I put it together immediately. The directions were well written and clear; although the instructions for putting on the rotating blades assumed you were replacing them! But it was easy to see past that.<br /><br />Prep for takeoff involves calibrating it's internal compass and making sure it is connected with the GPS. Not hard. I found it best to turn on the aircraft first, and then the control panel. Next turn your iPhone on and connect to the Holystone wireless. Once that is accomplished the program on your iPhone will say 'ready for flight'.<br /><br />Don't do your first flight indoors. The drone is a little intimidating at first and you need room to handle it. It will hover at about five feet and wait for instructions.<br /><br />I realized quickly that when one instructed the drone to 'go forward', 'forward' meant the direction the camera was looking. Just something to remember.<br /><br />The 'come land at home key' is handy but be sure you have a lot of room for error as it will not come right back to your feet.<br /><br />The 760 p camera provides and excellent smooth video with great resolution. It is gimbeled so you can point it up and down, if you have enough coordination to do that while controlling flight!<br /><br />Flying it at first was a challenge, at least for me.

I'm 64 years old, so the fact that an old fart is trying to fly a drone for the first time, you can pretty much bet it's not going to go very well. It was even windy, gusts up to 10 MPH. Well these guys have built a very stable quadcopter with some real nice idiot-proof (old-age-proof) features. Once I figured out why the app was telling me the batteries were bad in the controller (I didn't pair the controller to the drone), the rest was a piece of cake! Calibrating the compass and all that good stuff! Then came the moment of proof. Pressed the launch button, and up it went, then hovered just below eye level. I played just enough to make sure it landed with the same button as it took off with, then I flew it a little way out and hit the Home button and it came right back to where it took off from and landed. Ohhhhhh, now I'm impressed. I played just a little more, trying to get it to go over to my neighbor's house when she and her children came home, but suddenly it would not listen to me and came right back home and landed. Battery was depleted.<br /><br />Fast forward weeks later, and I am getting pretty good at flying this thing. I need to get better because my dog wants to eat it, and there are trees everywhere. But I have played with all of the features, running it out of touch with the controller, running the battery down, and simply pressing the return to home button, and the HS100 comes right back home and lands safely.<br /><br />The only feature I have not tried is the Follow Me. I'll get around to that when I get my mountain bike back up and running.<br /><br />So for a cool drone that's very reasonably priced and idiot and old age proof, this is a great buy!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGNW3PCGXBNVE6W2OREULM2CGSSA,1521773353376,0,False

Calibration should be done steadily, on a level surface. Don't fly in marginal weather conditions. Get and use one of the drone weather/condition apps. Fly in an absolutely open area.

208,5.0,AWESOME DRONE!!!!!,[[VIDEOID:1f32672d6040c3e61f925ac919d4bf6a]] I LOVE this drone! I own many drones (quadcopters) and this just became my favorite! It is so easy to fly for a beginner and a novice flier. You can adjust the flight distance from 30 meters to 400 meters. It comes set to 30 meters until you learn all the controls and everything this little gem can do. You can't go wrong. when you reach 30 meters it returns back to you. When you get the hang of everything set it how ever far and high you want it to go! It has a &#34;follow me&#34; feature that the drone follows you were ever you go. I have not tried that yet but I will when I get to some open space. It also has a &#34;return home&#34; feature. Just push the home button and the drone rises and comes back and lands right where you took off. I have used that and I was amazed how close it landed to me!!! I think that is the best thing about this. The scariest part of drone flying is losing orientation (which way the drone is facing) that's 99% of anyone losing a drone. No worries with this one! Just push the home button and it'll come back to you!! I got about 13 mins fly time but It was fighting winds and recording video and taking pictures.I highly recommend the HS-100.

209,5.0,First I'd like to say that more experience drone users were very ...,"This is my 1st drone.  I purchased it base on other reviews and some research from other I know that have drones.  First I'd like to say that more experience drone users were very impressed with the quality and features of the HS100. Similar drones would cost at least twice as much.  Secondly, being the 1st time drone user, I was completely taken by how easy it was to fly and land.  This is great for beginners like me who don't want to crash or lose the drone.  The auto take off, auto landing, and return home features are great.  Also, the camera app is easy to use with real time video is also amazing.  Finally, I have to say that their support group is also amazing.  I had a couple basic questions regarding its use since I am a beginner, and their customer service was great.  I would recommend the FS100 especially for Newbies.  The price, ease of use, features, and great customer support make this a 5 star product.

215,5.0,Easy to Setup and Fly; Reasonable Price;  Feature Packed,"I’ve been in the RC flying Hobby for 40+ years. I have avoided Helicopters/Drones because they are notoriously known to be hard to setup, maintain and fly. The HS100 is an amazing EXCEPTION. Assembly, Setup and Flying is unbelievably EASY. The HS100 has many features that are in much more expensive drones. If you want to get into Helicopters and Drones this is the product to buy. The RTH (Return to Home) and Auto Takeoff and Land features get you into the air and back down on the ground very quickly, with little risk of crashing. The camera and SD Card worked better than I expected. The HS100 price is just right. Not too expensive for all the features you get and NOT so inexpensive that it is feature lacking. The HS100 is feature abundant!<br /><br />Some Recommendations:<br />Read the instructions carefully and a number of times before doing anything.<br />Inventory the parts carefully before assembling the Drone.<br />(I couldn't find some washers which were stuck down deep inside the box which I finally found).<br />Make sure everything is fully charged, HS100, Transmitter and your Cell Phone.<br />Insure your WiFi is turned on in your cell phone.<br />You can fly the drone without a cell phone, but using one gives you a lots of extra status information so you get the HS100 flying quickly.<br /><br />Install the propeller guards. Some people think they may not look that great. They work and it beats replacing props in the event of an oops.<br /><br />A Good Routine:<br />Have a spotter with you on your first few flights.<br />Check and recheck everything before your first flight.<br />Make a Check List. The instruction manual has a very good first flight check list (Good Starting Point).<br />DON’T fly if you see something wrong, FIX IT First!<br /><br />Buy an extra battery. 12 minutes is about average flying time.<br />Some people complain that it's too short. Believe me, you have to concentrate on flying any RC model, 12 minutes is a long time.<br />After flying, take a break, think about what happened and what you want to improve on.<br />Take notes. Holy Stone provides a notebook (great idea). All good pilots use log books.<br />Recharge the batteries then fly again (Drone &amp; Transmitter).<br />If you fly at a park with no power, you can get an inexpensive charger that runs off a 12v car outlet.<br /><br />Wether you fly full size aircraft or models, the rule is check and recheck to minimize something not setup correctly, thus avoiding the chance of a crash.<br /><br />When you are learning how to fly, the less distractions the better. Try to fly your first flight on a zero wind day (either early morning or in the evening when the wind is calm). The HS100 is very light, and very stable, so wind (if strong enough) can make the drone drift if you are not under GPS control.<br /><br />Remember: The HS100 has the auto controls so you can take off and land with almost no experience.<br /><br />However, if you want to start flying your drone far away and/or navigating around objects, you have to learn that the controls reverse as you change direction.<br /><br />When the Drone is flying away from you: the Left control turns the drone Left; the Right control turns the drone Right; This is from your view point to the drone.<br />When the Drone is flying towards you Left control turns the drone to your Right, the Right control turns the drone to your Left. This is from your viewpoint to the drone.<br /><br />A real good thing to do is find a friend that has an RC flight Simulator so you can get the hang of flying an RC model if you never have flown one before. Simulators are not necessary, but they can help you master the controls without having to think about it. The more instinctively you can control the drone the less chance of a crash. Some hobby shops now offer using a Simulator for a few hours at a time. The more you practice, the better you will get at flying. No magic here, just practice!<br /><br />Once I got the hang of flying the HS100, I did a roof inspection on my house and my neighbors house which is a good use for Drones.<br /><br />Sorry for being so long winded. I wish I had someone giving me some tips so I could have avoided some of my oops. I hope my review will get people excited about flying and help them get into flying the HS100. The HS100 is an EXCELLENT product and a heck of a lot of FUN to fly!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFCWNKLX5CLTAMTQOVDGEPNC4F7A,1525607337440,118,True
216,5.0,fun fun fun (revised),"I purchased this Holy Stone HS100 for my first time drone piloting experience. I have flown helicopters since I was a kid and I decided to dip my toe into the drone world. Received the HS100 and proceeded to go through the setup. Setup was easy and I had no problem pairing the drone to the controller and my phone. Time to fly. The maiden flight was in my backyard which is fairly large and I was able to grasp the controls in a few minutes performing figure 8 maneuvers, landings, take offs, etc until I started to feel more comfortable with the controller and the drones reaction time. I was very impressed with how responsive the drone was in the air along with how stable it was. As with any un-manned aircraft wind is always a concern, so I did a test flight with the drone on a fairly windy day here in Atlanta and to my surprise the drone handled 10-15 MPH winds with no problem. Taking the drone to higher altitudes I was even more amazed at how well the drone performed. I have yet to lose control over the drone from interference, or flying away etc. I think the most impressive thing for me being a helicopter pilot is how you can get the drone at a desired altitude and basically take your hands off the controls and maneuver the drone to take video and pictures. I would never even think of doing that with a helicopter.. whole different world. Build quality: the HS100 is build rather solid and doe snot feel cheap in your hands. The controller for this particular drone is a little small for my hands and a little unbalanced when you have a large cell phone attached to it but not a show stopper. I quickly got used to the controller and it to has a decent build quality. The controls are intuitive and pretty much placed where they make sense so I did not have to continuously refer to the manual to understand what buttons and sticks did what. I have not crashed the drone yet but I think it would hold up fairly well in that case. Battery life was decent at about accurate to the advertised flying time.  I don't think you can ever get enough battery life out of any drone as time does ""fly"" when having fun (pun intended). Price vs performance well I am no authority on that yet because as I  stated this is my first experience with a drone, but for me it was well worth the price I paid, and I look forward to the fun I will have with this guy.<br /><br />revision: So in the review above I stated that the drone was able to sustain decent flying in 10-15 mph winds. Well today is a windy day and after looking at the forecast we are having winds in the 15 MPH range so i wanted to test the HS100's capability. While the HS100 did hold its own I would not try to fly this particular drone in worst conditions than 15 MPH winds. I would suspect you will get even more of a battery drain due to constantly forcing the drone against the wind and or recovering from a gust. So just a FYI. One other thing I forgot to mention about the HS100 is the image quality from the camera. Not bad for a 1080P camera. Video was crisp and clear in the right lighting conditions and I would suggest as with any camera filming with the sun to the drones back for the best results. the Gimbal stabilizes the camera pretty good however on windy days some camera shake cannot be avoided. Other than that not bad at all. I recommend this drone especially for someone new to flying drones like me. However it does have enough features to satisfy the enthusiasts as well.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF3QVOXN3MTV2ZQ7XINLC64TQJNA,1587487965585,0,True

Then they answered with, ""some defects on the drone's circuit board resulting the issues you currently have with it"" and offered me a slight discount on a new drone. So the drone was defective out of the box and I'm not sure what the tests they asked me to do for them were to accomplish besides making the drone crash again.  The drone never flew and that should not be my problem - if you believe you make a good product with an occasional defect please replace it and not ask me to buy another.

235,4.0,New to drones - let's see how this works out...(Update 5/11/18),"New to the drone world, after only experiencing a small $20-$30 drone and practicing indoors.  Obviously, this is a much more capable unit. My experience from one weekend of trial and error are as follows:<br /><br />1)  First indoor flight without reading the manual in depth - crashed into wall.<br />2)  First outdoor flight - took off and pitched left, into the bushes.<br /><br />Let's read the manual a bit more...<br />3) Followed the pre-flight checklist, paired with the phone, aquired GPS, and we can take off.  Had about 3 basic flights roaming around which worked out well (ie - didn't crash into stuff)<br /><br />A few issues I've had:<br />Synching/pairing can be a tedious process. Turn on the controller, turn on the drone, connect to wifi, wait for GPS, spin around in circles, calibarte (each time mind you) then you can start to fly.<br />However, I can not get this thing to stream video reliably to my Samsung S9+ - it'll catch a glimpse of something here and there, but fly by phone? Maybe mine's defective, I don't know - but definitely have not gotten it to stream reliably.<br />It is as stable as can be in wind - this isn't a $1k+ drone, so it is what it is. Controls are good, return to home and takeoff/land work well.<br /><br />But - on the last flight, I used a combo of return to home and land - crashed it into the only chain link fence in the park and broke the rotor guard (thankfully I had it on!) - but with the spare parts I was able to swap that out fairly quickly.<br /><br />Definitely need more than 1 battery as these take an eternity to charge when you want to use it.<br /><br />Will update this review as needed for more real-world experience.<br />-----------------<br />UPDATE - 5/11/18<br /><br />Since flying this drone a bit more, I've gathered a bit more experience with some tips and tricks about this drone.<br /><br />First - take your time. This won't be something that you power on and fly in 10 seconds.<br /><br />Here's my process:<br />Turn on the controller<br />Turn on the drone<br />Pair the drone (quick up and down on the left controller)<br />Go into the app to view the camera<br />Calibrate - spin around in a circle with the drone, tilt the drone so the camera points to the sky, do another turn, the set the drone down on a flat surface.<br />Enter the app, and wait until you have a good GPS signal.

It will return home if battery gets low or it gets out of range.  There is also a &#34;follow me&#34; feature.  I did a good bit of research before selecting this model and I have been pleased with it so far.  Video quality is very good.

242,5.0,OUTSTANDING DRONE (HS100),"I ordered this drone after much research!  When it arrived, I read the manual COMPLETELY and proceeded to assemble and set it up.  It was very easy to set up and calibrate.  I am an EXTREME NOVICE to drones, and it was very easy for me to get my maiden flight underway.  It is an exceptional drone for the beginner, and I look forward to utilizing it to its fullest potential.  For the price point, it is a great product.  My neighbor, who is an experienced drone pilot, said that the ease of use and quality of this drone, he is purchasing 2 for his family!  (he has 2 kids, 10 and 11 years.)  He also said he wishes that this drone was manufactured 8 years ago (when he originally got his drone.)  Customer service was very helpful also, by sending me web links for instructions and tips with this drone.  I only wish that it came with 2 batteries!  But, I will be getting another to increase my flight time!  Damn, it's fun!!!!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AH63DMICRRGR67WXD37WO2ZRM5VA,1627671320064,0,True
243,5.0,Cool drone for the money!,"I like this drone! Out of the box you must put the blades on it. This is not an easy task, because the screws and washers are very small. Prepare yourself with a pair of tweezers. Also, I found it to be very helpful to magnetize the included screw driver. Over all I am very pleased with this drone. The camera is not the best though, 720P. The app is very good and the GPS feature works well. I haven't had an opportunity to try the Follow Me feature yet due to bad weather in my area. I will update this review as I test out all of the features of this drone. The main reason I only gave 4 stars instead of 5  at this time is because I noticed a drift which came from nowhere. I was hovering it and it suddenly went it's own way. I was able to recover it easily since I was in Headless mode. Not sure why it did this. I was not using the app at the time. Just the remote. The only other reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because of the camera. I think that if Holy Stone installed a better camera on this thing it would rank second to none! It flies well and is very responsive. I have also flown it with the app and the GPS brings it back home within 3 feet of where you calibrate it.  This is a great feature, especially if the remote loses power or the battery on the drone gets low. It will fly back to the spot where you calibrated it. Again, I'll update this review as I try out other features.<br /><br />UPDATE: This is one fantastic piece of work! I changed from 4 stars to 5, partly because of &#34;user error&#34; during my issue with the drone drifting off suddenly, and mostly because of the extreme customer service I have experienced since having purchased this and the HS200.<br />The follow me feature on this one works well. Also, I love the 3-D feature when using the app! I can fly the drone and let someone else wear the goggles and they have a wonderful experience! The other feature I love is how stable this thing is when there is a bit of wind. I have hovered it during a breeze and just watched it. If the breeze blows it, it auto compensates and stays in place.<br /><br />Again, considering the cost, this drone is well worth every penny in my book. I think a camera upgrade is in the works as well. If so, I would give 6 stars if it were possible!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFSKZJDMOP5TWAAVS4HBOFW4KRRQ,1526517808337,0,False

Setup was a breeze and the directions were easy to understand and follow. Love the GPS function and the built in sd record, however the reader and card both ""malfunctioned"" when i tried to view it on my Windows 10 computer. not a big deal as i have others I can use and I think most companies wouldnt includes these items for free anyways. I did have some issues with the camera when trying to move it up and down with the remote as well, but i was able to fix it.<br /><br />The app is easy to use and straight forward and quality is very nice. I have looked at drones in the past and never purchased one because there are just to many to choose from and i was afraid to waste my money on a crappy drone and wasnt willing to pay the money for a really nice one without having experience. This was a best case scenario for me and I'm really excited to have this drone and will likely recommend it to everyone starting out with drones.<br /><br />Though it says 16+ and i wouldnt recommend young kids to fly it unsupervised, my 7 year old was able to fly it no problem. with dedicated landing, takeoff and fly home buttons its really simple for anyone to operate.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719SJptz8zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719SJptz8zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719SJptz8zL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEU2PAMUM6XVA5ESBP4KZK4CZS6A,1543775327318,0,False

Initially maybe did it like once a week for a few weeks then forgot about it for a while then a few months later again started playing with it and bought a second battery to get more fly time.  around the 10th flight the camera stopped moving.  which complicates flying.  When we called the company they said there is only a 90 day warranty.  So basically execpt this drone will fail in some way or another after 90 days and then become a paperweight.  When i inquired about a replacement camera they said sorry non in stock and none online.  Ok i get this is not a super expensive drone.  But i would think more than 10 flights.

I had many toy drones, none lasted more than 3 days of using, so I say this is the one closest to a real drone. Advice to persons new to flying drones, you need to familiarize and practice the controls at low altitude, practice in open space, be patient, this is not a toy so start slow.

Because such tiny screws are used to attach the propellers, I assembled mine on on a bed sheet. One caveat: My cell phone could not be properly clamped in the control unit, as needed to position the drone for photos.  Instead, I used a heavy rubber band to attach the phone to the control unit, which works fine.  One reviewer complained about poor service, but my experience was otherwise.  I was getting ""VPN interference"" messages when I first attempted to connect the cellphone app to the drone.  I emailed HolyStone and got a prompt reply to shut off my phone's ""MOBILE DATA"" and ""ROAMING"" features.  Problem solved.  Also, be cautioned that the ""Return Home"" feature takes several seconds to begin, although it works great. Good aerial photos with a nice, loud ""click"" sound, and good videos.

264,4.0,Better than a selfie stick,"I asked for and received this for my birthday. I was excited and assembled it all that night but wasn't willing to fly the drone for the first time at night. Instead I setup a charging station for the battery, 2 extra batteries I got, and transmitter. I read that you need to be careful to use the cables that came with the drone so I used those 3 cables (1 with the drone and 2 with the extra batteries). After the first battery showed fully charged I switched it to the transmitter and left it on charge all night.<br /><br />First thing in the morning I took the drone out and followed the setup directions. I had some trouble understanding the lights so I turned on the app and followed the on screen directions. Then I pressed the button to take off and ... nothing. I figured I did something wrong so I turned off the drone and transmitter then went through the process again.<br /><br />Only this time the app said the transmitter battery was too low. I went through that process several times before giving up and going inside. I called support and found they wouldn't be open for 5 hours because they are on the opposite coast. I was really frustrated and considered just returning the whole thing but did some searches. Turns out a review here gives the answer.<br /><br />When the app says the transmitter battery is too low and you know it is charged, just move the left control stick all the way up and all the way down.<br /><br />So second time out I did all the calibration, moved the control stick, then it still wouldn't take off so I activated the gyro calibration again by moving the left control to 11 and right to 1. The lights flashed a few second and when I pressed the take off button it spun up and lifted into the air.<br /><br />I think my surface when the gyro was calibrated wasn't perfectly horizontal because it was drifting a bit so I landed, picked a new spot and recalibrated the gyro and tried again. This time the drift was much better so I carefully tested the controls. Everything worked well and I walked it down the drive. I was very careful to stay back a few feet and make slow movements with the drone. We have a fair number of trees so the goal was to stay low and away.<br /><br />At one point I think I got too low relative to the sloping yard and the wash confused the drone. All the sudden it banked hard into the yard and flipped over even though I wasn't touching the controls at the moment.<br /><br />Fortunately the blades weren't damaged, just a little dirt. I recalibrated and tried again. This time I made a full circuit of the yard and sent the drone about 30' away, brought it back, took it from the basement walkout level to above the 2 story house, and made a transit above the house and back.<br /><br />Then I started testing the auto landing feature starting low then higher and eventually above the house down to the walk out level.<br /><br />Over all I'm really happy with how it performed. I took a few pictures and they are similar quality to my old iPhone5s. For the money I think this is a great starting drone. It's much easier to control than the mini drones I've had in the past.<br /><br />One interesting benefit, when I walked along the drive the wash was strong enough to clear the few leaves that had fallen.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHXPMQ7YOOHFIKJKAKBCJ2AF7UDA,1545400407893,0,True
265,4.0,"Worth the money, but buy extra batteries.","[[VIDEOID:27b0880080008a7ad81d8ef38281f4bd]] So far, so good. I was debating between this and splurging on a Phantom 3 Advanced. This one had good reviews, and it was much less expensive. I'm still pretty new to flying, so I figured if I break one I would rather break a less expensive one. The GPS is super handy for maintaining a hover and flying in wind. The camera is very sufficient for my level of use. A full gimbal would be nice, but that comes with more expensive models. You get what you pay for. The controls are easy to learn, including the ones for pivoting the camera, managing recording and picture taking. I REALLY like the App. It is very cool to watch the camera feed while flying, and the status indicators on the app are much easier to see than the indicator lights on the controls. I did buy a two-pack of batteries, which was offered at a discount on Amazon at the time of purchase. The flight time goes by fast, especially if there is a little bit of wind and the motors have to work harder. A max of 15 minute flight time and a 3-6 hour recharge time for the batteries is kind of a bummer. I have a total of three batteries, so it isn't as bad of a wait. I also purchased the spare parts pack. So far, the only thing I have damaged are the rotor guards, but I suppose that is their purpose. Better to damage a guard than a rotor and motor.<br /><br />So to summarize, I think it was worth the money.

275,5.0,More durable than expected,"Ordered this drone to practice flying before considering purchasing a more advanced drone.  Out of the box, it was easy to add the blades and get things going.  Take off and landing is a breeze with the automated process.  Battery life is ok for what you pay for.  I haven't tested maximum range (you have to loosen up flight rules to get maximum range/altitude).  Camera synced up with my kids tablets and they found it fun.  If I was rating this based on the camera, I'd rate it 3 stars.  But I've had a couple of hard landings (pilot error) including an epic one.  In short, I crashed it 60 foot up in a tree and got it wedge in a crook in the branches.  I figured it was toast, as everything I tried failed to bring it down.  Eventually, we had a severe storm move through the area, and it fell (60 feet) during the storm.  The landing skid took a good hit and partially broke, but its still good enough for routine landings.  The camera got knocked loose from its mount, but snapped back into place and works like new.  And perhaps more impressively, since I didn't know it had come out of the tree during the storm, it survived 3.5 inches of rain.  I found it the next morning, took it inside, and let it dry for a couple of days.  Charge the battery, go through the preflight routine, and it fired right up.

It has far exceeded my expectations!<br /><br />I have owned and flown other drones in the past but they have always been difficult to control and break before I really get to master them. This drone is extremely simple to get started with and takes fantastic pictures!

330,5.0,Super easy to fly! Camera plastic is very cheap. Upgraded camera is a battery hog!,"I am writing this review to highlight what I liked and a couple of things I didn't.  The drone arrived with fast as always free prime shipping. The box is proper and packaged securely.  Assembly was simple even with instructions being in translated English. Pretty straight forward set up and calibration.  I stayed in beginners mode for the first day to be safe. This is only my 2nd drone, and the first was a child toy that was junk. I was prepared for a few crashes while learning how to fly it. However, It was the exact opposite! This drone basicly flew itself. Easy take off, easy land! GPS and return home worked perfect! Very good beginner/hobby drone. I was very impressed with battery life and total control.<br /><br />Now, I will say that my first crash was a bit upsetting. The drone went to ""motor protection"" mode and basically just fell from the sky with no control. I was pretty disappointed when I realized the camera had smashed to pieces... (not repairable) . I went back online and bought the upgrade version camera (1080p). Plug and play simple install.<br /><br />The upgrade 1080p camera works well, but has been a battery hog and cuts flight time in half. There is no option to buy a replacement 720 camera or I would go back to it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dx5TeZxCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dx5TeZxCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dx5TeZxCL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEBVXJANI5VPEGXWWLL2QSBNILKQ,1533376772417,0,True

It's very maneuverable and it's stable in flight. I took some video that I can see on my phone but the file was too big to transfer. So I'll go out tomorrow and try for a shorter one. It was only about 5-6 minutes but it wound up being over 30mb and my phone just refused to send it anywhere. But this bird is fabulous. Besides the fact that the customer service with this company is about the best I've ever seen, this drone is on the way to giving DJ some serious competition. The quality of the video is really good and I'm so sorry I couldn't show it but I'll have something better up tomorrow. I would recommend this drone without reservation. Had a chance to go out and fly again. Unfortunately it's Saturday and I went to the park and it was full. LOL. Kids and dogs everywhere. BUT, when you've gotta fly, you've gotta fly.

So if you think you are missing them, flip the foam box over.<br /><br />First flight:<br /><br />This drone was easy to fly.  One button takeoff and landing really helps a novice flyer like myself. Was a little windy and drone flew well as the wind started to pick up.  When the wind got a little to much for my skill level, one touch landing saved the day.<br /><br />Controller:<br />The camera is not working on my controller.

The camera quality could be a little better 1080p etc but 720p video is still good. I would recommend this product to others.<br /><br />Only 2 negatives I have are not being able to move camera up or down, and the blades are a pain to install.<br /><br />Any advice on gimble dial troubles would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />First drone controller didn't charge and camera would not go up or down. I returned it no hassle and glad I bought another one. OMG this drone is so fun and easy to fly. I have no experience and was flying this well after 3 flights. My 12 yo daughter has flown it as well. She had a blast.<br /><br />I tried using follow me mode and it actually worked. I expected this function not to work from YouTube vids and forums, but mine did. I just followed the instructions to the letter.<br /><br />Watch wind speeds, any drone in this weight class I'm sure would have trouble in higher winds. I took it out for a flight one afternoon and the wind was calm. Half way through my flight winds picked up to 20mph and started pushing the drone around. I clicked home and it fought it's way back to me safely.<br /><br />Fast shipping, great product, and easy for a beginner. If you are looking for a good beginner drone, this is it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I9v5Tn4cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I9v5Tn4cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I9v5Tn4cL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wsnm0fFZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wsnm0fFZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Wsnm0fFZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zXWHFhEhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zXWHFhEhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zXWHFhEhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zkoTEowNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zkoTEowNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zkoTEowNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF76LH7KIG56OF4FRSF6VOLWEDGQ,1520100473328,18,True
357,4.0,Difficult to remove battery.,"I've had the HS100 for 2 weeks. This is my first drone. So far I have busted the landing gear by pushing the emergency stop button and watching it fall from 6'.  On second flight, I panicked thinking it was going to crash into the side of my house and pushed the ES button. Luckily, the drone comes with spare landing legs. That won't happen again.

360,5.0,Excellent Product and Value,"I’ve provided pictures of the unboxing experience. Very nice box and packaging to protect the drone during shipping. The blades seemed to be missing, but they are stored on the underside of the protective styrofoam. Drone is constructed very well and feels solid. In comparison to my Syma X5C, this is like a Cadillac. The instructions are very clear and easy to read, unlike other drone manuals I’ve seen. I highly recommend going on YouTube and watching quick demos which show how to set this up for the first time. I had trouble with calibration until I finally connected the app, which walks you through the process and makes it much more simple. The only other trouble I had was getting the screws into the caps for the blades. For some reason the screws sunk in far enough so that the caps slid on for the A sides, but coincidentally on the B sides the screws wouldn’t sink in far enough so I forced the caps on but the are a little uneven and wonky. That aside, I took it for a quick flight tonight since the drone had enough of a charge for a quick 5 minute flight. This thing flies like a dream, you press “take off” and it just fired up the engines and then launches into a hover at about 3 feet. Very smooth operation, and I turned the variable speed all of the way down since I was in a small yard and it was dark. Excellent for beginners, but I can tell that there’s so much more to offer for the advanced drone enthusiast. All of the beginner features can be turned off, so I hope to slowly advance with this drone over time. A very good purchase and I highly recommend.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711vtVwFCdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711vtVwFCdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711vtVwFCdL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719IWNvXipL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719IWNvXipL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719IWNvXipL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U4cWbINEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U4cWbINEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71U4cWbINEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k40HO31wL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k40HO31wL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71k40HO31wL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71llNEXLpkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71llNEXLpkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71llNEXLpkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qogNt2+VL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qogNt2+VL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qogNt2+VL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sCKtxhFtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sCKtxhFtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sCKtxhFtL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jNZJDbGRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jNZJDbGRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jNZJDbGRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vi3vXIscL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vi3vXIscL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vi3vXIscL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF6TN3LMPT72WFP6MRJ6QPXV2QFA,1524192456471,1,True

365,4.0,Service and courtesy.,"About a year ago I bought a Holy Stone HS 100 GPS drone.<br />Well the warranty had expired before I tried to fly it, what with having to apply and receive my FAA license and the hot AZ weather etc..<br />Long story, after scrupulously following the instructions, I lifted it off and with a big smile on my face, I toggled the forward command and off it went, and went, and went, never to be seen again.<br />Well after expressing my disappointment on Amazon, I got a message from the manufacturer, nice guy called Max, who said that in spite of the expired warranty, considering the circumstances, he would look into it.  Last week I decided to give them a call back. Got a nice lady, Mila, who apologized for the inconvenience and would place an order for me....day before yesterday, brand new drone shows up.🤗🤗🤗<br />I would have to give a 10+++ for their service and business ethics. I cannot remark on the product quality as yet, but I have confidence that the first model must have been a fluke, a glitch or something as I haven't seen any complaints on line from other purchasers.<br />In any case my experience with HolyStone has been positive and I can vouch for the integrity of the company.<br />W.

366,4.0,Excellent Beginner Quadcopter,"My fiance bought me the HS100 for my birthday knowing that I had been wanting a ""hobby"" drone for a while. I had a much smaller and cheaper Holy Stone that I flew around the house and basement so this was a logical step up. I've worked in a hobby shop and have quite extensive experience with RC cars, planes, and helicopters, but never had anything other than a small ""toy"" drone before the HS100.<br /><br />I probably spent an hour assembling it, reviewing the manual, and watching a few YouTube videos while the drone battery and controller batteries charged. They're standard micro USB which makes it super convenient to charge on the go or in the car.<br /><br />I took it outside in our front yard with a light breeze. I used the auto take-off and landing function a few times just to make sure everything worked. The first battery I never let the drone get more than ~50 feet from me just to familiarize myself with it and build up a level of trust and comfort. This thing is incredibly steady and easy to fly. I never expected a drone at this price point to fly so well.<br /><br />The biggest downfall is the video can be a bit shaky since there's no image stabilization or true gimbal. However, at this price point, I can forgive that. Also, the Android app could use a little work and the LED indicators on the controller can be difficult to see in direct sunlight. None of these are major issues or would keep me from recommending the HS100 to a friend.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF745EPOKH2DSOCE26KPCYDDLIAA,1535427185826,0,False

It is responsive, has a pretty good camera, and is a lot of fun to fly.  There are a few negatives, though, since this isn't a $4,000 drone.  The assembly instructions aren't quit right (the camera is already installed so those directions aren't needed; screws packaged as &#34;extra&#34; are needed for the initial assembly; etc.)  The tradeoff between battery weight and flight time gives it only about 20 minutes aloft before a recharge.  And it is a bit stubborn sometimes to pick up a GPS signal - which is required for the thing to fly.  However, the positives of price and overall quality make up for the negatives.

My grandson got one for Christmas and after failing miserably to help him get it flying I decided to see if there were any easier drones to learn on.  I read a lot of reviews and finally settled on the HS100.  It's a good starter drone for me and although a bit more expensive it's still affordable.  I'm impressed with how easy it was to get ready to fly. The only real issue I had was installing the screws that attached the props.  Maybe Holy Stone will come up with a more user friendly way to do this but it doesn't detract from the overall satisfaction I have with the product.<br />First flight was amazing. I went to Holy Stones web site and viewed a couple videos to show how to set up and fly.  After calibrating the compass and getting GPS acquired, I set the throttle to the lowest setting and pushed the button for take-off.  It responded quickly but not fast enough to make me nervous.  I tried out all the functions and they all performed perfectly.<br />If your looking for a great starter drone you should give this one a try.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGGOTAFXKGFS65NMUI3DCYS4GK7A,1519159700158,0,True

GPS/Camera/App all work great, anywhere.","[[VIDEOID:7e4d839804980bfb00cad091ea6d8ec5]] Ok, story time first...I had gotten a TRNDLabs Fader from the Marlboro Rewards program which is a cool little toy...if it worked. It refused to connect to any of my three phones,  including a Galaxy S9, K7 (older), and a KeyONE through any app that should have allowed it, simply not in the WiFi list.<br /><br />So no camera, support was terrible and I was impatient..well, my first real flight outdoors it flew off back to Hong Kong for all I know, with no camera and it just taking a stroll all by itself I will never be sure.<br /><br />That was my first drone...talk about a hobby killer.<br /><br />I decided to give this hobby one last shot, did tons of research and came across this little diamond in the rough, a little more expensive than the Fader, (both on sale at the time of this review), but with many more features such as GPS (a must for beginners who don't want to buy 7 drones in a month), return home, follow me, and an app that actually works!<br /><br />Not only does it work and connect  even in a packed signal zone, it confirms your GPS, the camera is great and it provides enough control to return and land your drone along with others features I haven't even tried to use yet.<br /><br />I have no idea why it didn't have great ratings, I am a dev myself and I think it works flawlessly, although I can't speak for its full feature set, I can say it has enough to save your butt if your controller gives you an issue or your not using it at the time (I.E. You set the drone to follow you).<br /><br />As you can guess, I was pretty pensive about bringing a drone to the great outdoors again for a first flight after that experience...well, i'm over that fear.<br /><br />Not only is customer support fast and responsive, they are truly behind their products...even sent me out a crash pack after crashing indoors out of my own stupidity, since I was truly afraid to test it outside when I contacted them about one touch landing with the controller.<br /><br />NOTE:<br /><br />Give the drone a bit of time to reach the expected takeoff height or redo your calibration, that turned out to be the issue in my case.<br /><br />With that out of the way, lets get down to the meat and bones of what I can say so far with the limited testing I have been doing while working with support over that.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />This is pretty long so for impatience sake, It does EVERYTHING it says it does, and I mean everything, without fail...and if it doesn't, customer support will handle it in a heatbeat.<br /><br />But here is the long version anyways.<br /><br />GPS, Camera, Controller, and App all function great, it had good signal even near a Wendy's and an ATM that were open, and a closed Dunkins which I have guest saved WiFi signal from saved on my phone. I still had perfect signal<br /><br />Return home when I tried it (after my indoor crash) was a tad off the exact placement, but not enough to bother you unless you set up a landing pad with a bullseye on it...or your foolish enough to fly it off the edge a cliff lol.<br />That may have been because of my propellors at the time being banged up, even then it flew ten times better than my Fader did without any trimming (a more precise calibration) needed, and I did do the trimming on the Fader.<br /><br />It truly hovers in place after the one button takeoff and it even has a beginner mode to prevent you from flying too far or too high (in the phone app settings) which you can later change for more advanced flight.<br /><br />It will also return home itself if you go beyond that or if the battery on either the drone or controller gets dangerously low.<br /><br />Did I mention its a toy that isn't a toy?<br /><br />When I put this together like a 6 yr. olds Christmas gift I thought I got a new tonka truck and was quite disappointed at first.<br /><br />It had an almost fully charged battery in the package, same with the controller, attach two landling legs with a twist and insert motion, attach the camera and twist to click (which has a protective cover on it that feels cheap, but does the job)...and you can literally start flying it on the spot. I charged the battery and controller fully personally, but it can be done if you wanted to test it right away.<br /><br />Oh ya, the point of all this. As I said, I crashed indoors my first flight...those propellors can move something beautifully scary, the sound it made hitting the low table made me think I destroyed one of the two.<br />If I did, it was the table (meh, who cares)...because the drone still flies good enough to insult most others, even in reviews.<br /><br />I'm gonna be frank, I can't drive a decently fast remote control car to save my life, I have only flown the Fader before this which was obviously defective...and I already have this spinning 360 degrees in a circle to catch myself on camera, tilting to the side in the air (so tempted to try a full flip), this has simple flight controls, 3 skill (speed) settings, and does exactly what you press when you press it.<br /><br />It's easy to fly, but has enough options to make remembered all the buttons more of a process than flying itself due to all the options...it can be switched into headless mode (direction you press is the direction it goes...regardless which direction the drone is in)<br /><br />A major plus, it has VR mode right on the app, still looking for a good headset right now...thats gonna be a blast. I have a wired Oculus Rift so I know how VR is in general, but flying in real life surroundings in VR...thats a whole new box of joy.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Battery charging time for such a short flight time is a nightmare, along with the price of batteries...but I knew this when I purchased the drone, so to knock off stars for it would be unfair, and pretty ridiculous on my part.<br /><br />The lower priced versions with less visual quality and no GPS on Amazon come with a spare AND a carrying case, both of which I need to get next.<br /><br />I do suggest a few batteries for this one, charging time is 3+ hours, but I gotta say its worth it...The camera is beautiful even at night and GPS is a must for anyone new to the hobby who is flying near anything that could cause them to lose sight of the drone...or you risk a Fader fly away like what happened to my first drone heh.<br /><br />As I said about others having a carrying case, this could use one, taking the legs off and on to put it in the box, which does have a carrying handle at least, would get annoying constantly especially if your walking 15 minutes with it to get about the same flight time on a single battery. Again, I was aware and its not a deal breaker...its worth investing a little extra for this one, it really is just that good.<br /><br />Update:<br />Found alot of things mentioning a free battery, its true. Got one on the way, and I even found it under the gallery in the App (I do not know if it was a recent update).<br /><br />the customer consideration/care/support from this company is beyond what people make it out to be. I can't recommend buying a drone anywhere else--and I have had mine approx. a month.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />The one thing the Fader had on this drone is the sleek design, this thing is a beast and not very pretty...but you don't see shrek getting stuck on a tiny tree branch either, so it has a plus side at the same time.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Buy? Now.<br /><br />Buying? Battery+++<br /><br />Walking? Case.<br /><br />Problem? Support.<br /><br />Searching? Stop.<br /><br />------------------<br />Am I Satisfied?<br />------------------<br /><br />Beyond what I thought was possible after the first drone. Best Bang for your buck right here, without question...and the support is truly one of a kind, I got responses through the Amazon app at 1 AM and 4 AM at certain points during my takeoff concern since I was flying at night, I live in the city and my options are limited right now.<br /><br />On a last note, this does require being registered, I don't see this as a pro or a con, since needing to do this means you have a big boys toy...but it is a minor annoyance in some peoples eyes.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ylkKwywYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ylkKwywYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ylkKwywYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lhyp4F0nL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lhyp4F0nL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lhyp4F0nL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGQY5XQ3K4ELDYI3QMS23E24B2ZQ,1593094406156,1,True

This allows during the learning process to get all back in place when you lost control, and take a deep breath.

440,4.0,"Start learning in slow speed and with ""headless"" mode.","I had very little confusion assembling. Just a little but the diagrams seem to be accurate.  It took a couple of hours.  I had to try it out without taking all the time to read all the info. It crashed a few times and broke the propeller guards.  Luckily they include an extra couple so I had immediate repairs.  I decided to find a place with more room which helped a lot. I finally got better at controlling. Don't move the controller stick too fast - small moves are best at first.  Also I discovered it defaults to 2nd of 3 speeds so I put it in the lowest speed and that helped.<br /><br />Another feature which helped was &#34;headless&#34; once I figured out the controller to make it go into that mode.  The second day I took it slow and had watched several how to fly videos explaining the contoller and all the led lights.  I did not crash once.  The headless feature worked.  The camera both photo and video worked.  I might get it yet.  My next big step is figuring out the app.  I flew it and took pictures without seeing them on the app but maybe tomorrow it will become better after more research.  One step land and takeoff works.  Fun to watch it land itself - it is slow and almost lands and then goes up a bit and then finally lands.  Motor sounds cool<br /><br />The propellers took a major beating from the initial crashes.  This drone is much heavier than my first one which was indestructible.  But they kept working. One time I had to unbend them but the plastic is resilient.  Now they are nicked up a bit but still work.  Luckily, also, 4 extra propellers are included.  I have not changed them yet.<br /><br />Not too much trouble getting the controller paired with the drone.  I don't know how you could fly this thing without headless mode, but I guess it must be possible LOL.  I know I am going to have a lot of fun with this drone.  I feel like it is easier to control than my previous lighter drone.  I got it because of the increased flying time of the battery and the follow me feature which I have not tried yet.  The battery does take several hours to charge.  I did not keep perfect track but it seems like about 7 hours last night.  Maybe I can track it closer this time.

The iPhone/SmartPhone interface was easy to install and configure and on Christmas Day we had our inaugural flight.  What a fun device, easy to fly, the camera is awesome and we have thoroughly enjoyed time with this device.  Battery flight time is about 20-30 minutes which is good.

476,5.0,"Stable, Easy to Fly and Good Camera Quality","[[VIDEOID:dd83d8ca31c7b616683542864e2c8198]] The Holystone HS100 drone is an advanced drone jam packed with load of features. I have couple of other drones but neither of them is as good as this one.<br /><br />The drone comes with very good transmission range, I took the drone to 116 meters in altitude and it was very much responsive, and in control; stability of the drone at that altitude was very impressive, it was holding its altitude pretty well which was very much visible in the video recordings. Video recordings at that level was smooth and stable. The features that makes me very comfortable while flying this drone is the Auto Return in case of signal drops or out of range or best, when the battery starts running low on power. I came across all the 3 scenarios and was happy to see that drone started coming back to its take-off location. Transmitter is powerful and reconnects on its own as soon as drone comes back in the range. This drone has a built in self monitoring system that keeps check on the battery charge and the distance its away from the take-off location, it starts Auto returning to the take off position as soon as it senses that the charge just enough to go back to the base.<br /><br />Take-off and landing is super easy, it comes with one-key take-off and landing button on transmitter. While flying if you click land button, drone will auto land vertically down, controlling the speed on its own. This drone also comes with Smart Return to home option that means no matter wherever the drone is, on clicking Return To Home button, it will come back to the start location. It does not have obstacle avoidance so before hitting Return to Home button make sure it has clear path. The drone is also equipped with Follow Me mode, which is very cool. The follow me mode operates using Smart Phone GPS signal following you wherever you go; I used it while flying the drone and it worked pretty well. There is headless flying mode option in the drone too, this feature is very useful for beginners when you are learning flying a drone.<br /><br />The drone comes with wide angle HD camera recording the videos in 720P; it can record the video or take the pictures in high definition. It comes with 90 degree Camera angle adjustment allowing you to record videos at multiple angle. While recording the video, transmitter keeps on continuously beeping, I really wish if there was a way to mute that. I recorded the videos from 116 Meters and the quality of the recording is very good. When connected to smart phone, drone is able to stream LIVE video’s. Camera comes with microSD card slot to store the recorded videos and pictures. Although when connected to smart phones, 2 minute videos are also recorded on the smart phone, while full videos are recorded and stored in attached microSD card. Since smart phone is connected over 2.4 ghz WIFI channel, the connectivity is limited and is lost after reaching certain altitude, definitely its not connected when flying at 100m altitude. I used their iOS app, it comes with lot of features including viewing live streaming in VR mode. The app also maintains the flying log showing the details like, Altitude, Distance and Speed per flight. The app also provides various flying status like “Waiting for GPS single”, “Transmitter not connected” and bunch of other details, helping first time flyer to get use to this Drone in no time. Talking about flying time, one full charge gives approximately 15 minutes of continuous fly time, which is pretty good. The only thing I think needs to be improved is the battery charging time, it take about 3-5 hours to get a full charge.<br /><br />The drone comes with extra spare parts, starting from landing gears to propellers, propeller guards, blade caps to screws, almost all the spare parts except for extra battery. I really liked that they provide those extra spare parts, haven’t seen many other manufacturers doing that. It also comes with a User Guide providing assembling instructions plus guide on setup and various modes. I used the guide to learn all the modes it comes with.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEU7CNZGN6GJINHPXK5SWT632H2Q,1517366104936,588,True

478,5.0,"Great Drone, Buy it!","[[VIDEOID:e6ea3d38456efadb70bd0703a004ef56]] After doing a fair amount of research, I decided to purchased the Holy Stone HS100 Drone from Amazon. This drone has all he features I was looking for and a few others as well. I definitely wanted GPS Navigation and a Return to Home functionality. It also comes with a “Follow me” Function, automatic take off and landing and you can fly manually without GPS if you wanted to; the altitude sensor will help keep the flight stable.<br />The removable Camera takes really nice pictures and the video is surprisingly clear and colorful in 720p HD. I was also sold on the overall size and look of this drone (not some mini thing) I think it looks really cool. The controller is easy to operate and feels very ergonomic.<br />I have seen some concerns from other reviews about how long it takes for the batteries to charge. I use my Samsung fast charger and it takes about 3 hours to charge,  however I strongly suggest getting another battery as two batteries makes for a really nice time out flying.<br />You may also get a Free battery from Holy Stone if you post an Honest review. I can Honestly say I am having a lot of fun flying this Drone.<br />My first flight seemed short but after a couple of recharges the batteries are now lasting almost 15 minutes of flight time. I am very happy with my Purchase of this drone and I didn’t have to spend a Thousand Dollars just to have some fun and get some great videos.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGGSMVHGW3CPMKCFC3I4XJPM5NYQ,1523207929801,2,True

The screwdrivers they supplied were just the right size and it was very nice to see that the package includes more than enough screws and such parts, in case you lose a few, as well as replacement propeller blades (I almost broke one the first time out) and other parts that might get damaged if you slam into a wall or a hard landing surface.<br /><br />Making the connection between the controller and the drone was very easy as was the step to calibrate the internal compass.  I connected my phone to the drone's wifi, attached it to the controller, and was surprised to see that the drone's camera was already on and sending the picture to my phone.<br /><br />With a little trepidation, I set the drone on the grass out back and pressed the lift-off button.  It rose and hovered about five feet above the ground, and stayed in place very well.  The motion controls worked very naturally, and I could soon turn the drone and fly in any direction I wanted.<br /><br />I suddenly realized that the yard has a lot of relatively low hanging branches, but could easily avoid them.  This was really a lot easier than I expected.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it then started to rain a little and I had to bring the drone down.  It was at this point that I realized I didn't remember how to land it and turn it off, and the instructions were on a table some distance away.  But the drone was hovering very stably and I was able to grab it from below and turn the power off manually.

492,4.0,Great drone for the price,"I bought this drone for my 12 year old son. He was able to pick it up fairly quickly. It’s easy to fly, and you get some pretty good distance and speed. Winds on my first flight were about 10mph, gusting to 15. I was shocked at how steady this thing stayed in those winds. There was a little movement at times, but for the most part it hovered relatively still even in these winds. I kept getting a warning that my transmitter voltage was low. But after some google searching I felt pretty stupid. When you turn the drone on, don’t forget to pair it by moving the left joystick up and down. The warning went away and I was good to go.<br /><br />Cons: at this price point there’s bound to be some cons. First, after maybe 100-150 feet away, it seems like I lose the ability to fly using live view. The camera just freezes and doesn’t come back on until I move closer. I’m a little confused by this, as I see YouTube videos of people flying it further but maintaining a solid connection. There’s almost no existing troubleshooting documentation regarding troubleshooting the camera or connection issues. So I have no clue how to fix this. However, it doesn’t affect flight if you have a line of sight. You can still fly it without the camera.<br /><br />RTH leaves something to be desired. It works, but it’s just not as accurate as other more expensive drones. It landed about 50 feet from the takeoff point. So my suggestion is make sure you’re in an open area when you take off and account for this accuracy.<br /><br />Another con is the camera movement. When tilting the camera in flight, it appears to move very slowly (if at all). Another confusing issue with virtually no troubleshooting help.<br /><br />The cons aren’t a huge deal to me, as you get what you pay for and doesn’t really affect the overall performance. But to some, it might be annoying. But with all things considered, it flys a lot better than what I honestly expected, and is a great beginning drone. I’d definitely purchase another for my other kids",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFPXR7AEPSDHTT3C53ZM3U67EPEA,1570994074021,0,False

Eventually, they replaced the drone free of charge, and even let me keep the broken system to use for spare parts, which have since come in quite useful.<br /><br />Any inconvenience I experienced to obtain a working drone was more than made up for by the quality of the system itself. GPS mode has proved a useful asset, helping the drone maintain the proper position in flight, and ensuring a safe descent from high-altitude flights. I personally recommend buying this product only if you are fluent with the controls of a quadcopter, simply to avoid crashing or losing this incredible piece of tech.<br /><br />This is a hobby grade drone--neither amateur nor professional. Its balance is superior. Camera stills are excellent and video is fairly good. It does not have obstacle avoidance or an automatic gimbal, but other than that, it has all the bells and whistles of leading professional drones, so you get a great bang for your buck.<br /><br />My flying experiences have revealed that the drone is easily controlled, even at altitudes of three hundred feet. It automatically senses and fights wind as well.<br /><br />In short, this is a top-quality drone for those that are interested in the hobby, and have at least some experience. It is a very rewarding product.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AG3BVYBJWCABUD66NQAPPAPTFUDA,1533858234413,0,True

Also for whatever reason, every time we turn it on, it has to go thru the whole entire calibration process again. We were happy it came with spare parts, as we have used most of them since it does not land gently on return to home.

Down side is the battery charge rate(3 to 6 hours) versus the flying time per charge (12 to 15 min). The camera takes great pics and videos. Assembly for someone with patience is easy, there are very small screws that hold the props on if you are not patient or not very good with your small motor skills this might be difficult.

If you are looking for an entry drone packed with features this is the one.<br /><br />Transmitter issues.<br /><br />For all those that say they charge their transmitter only for the app to say that its low on battery.....try this. Turn on transmitter (after its charged), turn on drone and set down. Connect phone to drone wifi, turn off mobile data (very important)  if you get the red warning about the transmitter battery then move the left joystick up then down......you're welcome.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UM67d9+QL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UM67d9+QL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UM67d9+QL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61c1UT6a4WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61c1UT6a4WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61c1UT6a4WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wc2OXzltL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wc2OXzltL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wc2OXzltL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFDWFY55A5F5QNQPQ7WKIMYVAQWA,1530840147663,1,True

565,5.0,Great Mid-Range RC Drone for the Money,"I held off a couple of months before writing this review.  Just needed to see if there was anything that didn't make a positive impression.<br /><br />The machine arrived on schedule.  The packaging and machine was all in one piece.  Except, though, the drone comes with a few pieces to install on the machine.  So, I guess, it wasn't 'all' in one piece.<br /><br />The installation instructions are easy for any to read and, carry out.  (Read & Follow them.)<br /><br />There are instructions for setting up the drone for flight and, the precautions needed to keep your drone in one piece and, in your possession.  (You don't want to heed those instructions?  OK, do as I did.)<br /><br />When just starting to learn to fly this drone.  Keep it close to you, minimum winds, not too high and away from the trees.  That's what I SHOULD have done.  About 50 feet up, a little bit of wind moved it over the top of 40 ft. trees, about 80 feet away, where, New Pilot Panic, set in and had the drone flying into the top of the trees.<br /><br />Fortunately, after my three attempts to even try to spot the drone in the trees, my 'Eagle Eyed' wife, found it in the thorn infested forest, at the base of the tree, in the crux of a stump from a dead tree.  No damage to the machine after a 40 foot fall and, hitting something hard.  Not bad!<br /><br />A suggestion you might wish to follow is; put your name and phone number on your drone.  Also, you may wish to do what I did, (after the temporary loss), that being, attaching a small LED flasher, with Velcro, to the top of your drone.  Turn it on, day or night, when flying.  (Can't find your lost drone in the day?  You'll find it at night.)<br /><br />The only thing about the drone that wouldn't get 5-Stars is, the visual quality of the camera.  It's not equal to what you would see from cameras on other more expensive drones.  But then again, who would expect that?  It is, clear and good enough to easily see where you're going, if you're using your cell phone screen or, a Pad.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGDQXJKVPCVMSDIC7KRAIEXNW43A,1544900473069,3,True

It's worth the time to read the instructions fully before taking your first flight ... not just the flight controls (up, down, left, right, forward, backward, ...), but the extra goodies like speed control, camera control, follow me, and calibrations. Then go out and have a blast.<br /><br />The GPS return to home is very accurate based on my experience, as is the automatic return if power is low.

600,5.0,Super happy with the HS100,"Recently, I crashed my HS110 into the lake behind my house. As I needed a suggestion as to what model drone to purchase next, I called Holy Stone customer support and spoke with Libby. She suggested the HS100! This turned out to be a great suggestion. I LOVE this drone! It flies just as promised. Highlights include auto take off and land, super hovering, and the camera - WOW!! Love the gamble control and the resolution is outstanding.

602,5.0,Best BANG for your $$$ BUCK! 5 STARS!,"This drone is by far one of the best I have owned. The packaging all the way up to the operation of the drone was smooth. Easy to put together and the battery just slides in and out with no problems charging. The flight time for this size of a drone is fairly decent (12-15 mins avg.) It does require the app to operate the drone which I am not too fond of but getting used to. From the prospective of a pilot that has flown toy drones all the way up to high end drones this one hits the mark for the $$. It handles very well and the GPS technology that went into the thought of this drone takes the cake. The (RTH) return to home key brings the drone back to where you took off from, SUPER impressive! The camera is pretty good but has a very minimal lag to the app and takes some great shots because of the drones stability. You can literally set the controller down and it will stay in one spot, then if the battery starts to die the drone (tells) itself will bring it back to your takeoff spot. My apologize for such a lengthy review but when you have a nice product you want people to know that they are getting QUALITY and what their hard earned $$ paid for. Not to mention, all the other features that I left out about that would be listed in the product description. As an frequent flyer this model (HS100) is the best bang for your buck for sure. Holy Stone still making great product and will handle any questions you have. Holy Stone really takes pride in their product and their customers!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710OGyQO4tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710OGyQO4tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710OGyQO4tL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-ecIsNJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-ecIsNJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I-ecIsNJL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DX2oKz+RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DX2oKz+RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DX2oKz+RL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFKWO2CNLYXSELIS3XBZ5M5BTMMQ,1511825717500,19,True

606,5.0,Capable Drone.  For around 200 dollars- it’s hard to beat!,"This is my second drone.  The other one is much smaller and less capable.  Bottom line - I wanted a larger more capable drone, but didn’t want to spend a ton of money on something that is really a toy.  Taking photos of your house is very cool- but not 700 dollar cool for me personally.  Like everyone else- did my research and decided on this.  Overall- has met most expectations.  I am still surprised when you can buy something like this for a couple hundred dollars-  It has GPS for crying out loud.  That gives you the ability to do a ton.  It will auto return if needed- like if you push the panic button, or it looses comm with the controller, or battery power gets low.  Great feature on more expensive drones.  The camera is not bad either- wish the photos were a little higher MB- but pics and video comes out nice.  The drone stores the better res photos on the memory card on the drone-  it also downloads compressed photo/video to your phone.  I thought the photos on my phone after the flight were what it was capable of- but after looking at the memory card I’m satisfied with the results.  Expectation has to be tempered just a bit- this is a ton of stuff on a drone that you can fly pretty high- higher really than I need, except to go “dang- that’s cool- wife, check out how night that is.”  Some other features that are nice = the controller lets you swivel that camera up and down- you can choose from three speeds as it is flying- you can choose a distance and height restriction  of the fight on the app  (great for first couple flights) - follow me feature- and once again the return home.  I’m also impressed at how the GPS will keep it hovering in one spot and not drift with the wind.  You can see it start to drift- then the GPS kicks in and will correct it.  One issue I’ve had is sometimes when the drone gets out of sight (like flying it to the front of the house while I ‘m in the back) I loose The video feed and have to get back in line of sight to recapture the feed.  The drone though will do a great job of hovering without drifting if you stop putting in control commands.  Battery takes a long time to charge- but I ordered a second one after the first week.  Two flights is about enough for me before charging again.  They also give a ton of spare parts.<br />Overall- hard to beat.. and its a ton of fun to fly.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFWFKYY7YWQ7O5OUGEXY6NJLNB3Q,1559794040067,3,True

I was very pleasantly surprised at how nice the video and photos came out and how steady this remained even in beginner mode with GPS.

Everything assembled just as the instruction said, and the directions for pairing the remote to the drone, calibrating the drone, and then flying the drone all worked just as written.  I've enjoyed flying this, and the remote control works well.  What has been frustrating is the poor connection between the wifi (generated by the drone's camera) and my iPhone X, the newest version of the iPhone running the most recent iOS.  I rarely get live video, and the connection is inconsistent on viewing the status of the drone.  Additionally, even when using the remote control buttons, the camera has not been consistently listening to commands.  I've only gotten it to record video 50% of the time, and the same with still photos.  My best video footage came up unrecorded so far.  That has been my only disappointment with the drone.

It was just past the rooftop to our two story home; there was no damage. She came in upset and put it on the charger. Today, we go out to try and get the sunset, and we don’t get that far. It did have a sketchy start and didn’t lift off that well, but then it seemed to continue on just fine…again, it just falls out of the sky, this time I witnessed it myself, and a propeller broke off, I’m guessing because it was higher, so more force? I came in here to look at the return policy and of course there is no recourse. Perhaps they can send a new propeller..until this happens again? We shall see. Anyways, save your money. The reviews and photos are stellar, and while it does take great photos, you will see that it tends to fall out of the sky for LOTS of other consumers.

685,5.0,Only drawback is 720p video resolution everything else is great,This is my first drone so having essentially zero experience at piloting I have been very surprised at how easy the HS100 is to fly.<br />Just release the controls to neutral and the thing just hovers where ever it is and you can gradually begin to fly it where<br />you want it to go. It is then your job to get smoother with the controls because a smooth flight means nicer video can be shot by the<br />720p video camera.  One thing to consider is the video camera though. In this era of jitter correcting Go-Pros that have 1080p or better<br />the camera on the HS 100 is the only weak point of this drone.  And by weak I only mean is 720p going to be good enough video<br />quality for you and what you want to film with this machine.  I wish the resolution was better but this is my first drone and for 279.00<br />I believe it is a great deal to get your start at owning and piloting a hobby drone.<br /><br />There is a small amount of &#34;some assembly required &#34; when you get this drone out of the box and that is to attach the propellers.<br />The 4 screws that you must use (one to each propeller) are quite small and it is a fiddly bit of kit to get tiny screws into tiny holes<br />but have patience and good light and you can get it done. When I went to start charging up the battery's I found that the drone<br />battery charged nicely but the controller was DOA right out of the box. It would not charge up and only 1 light was lit on it's panel.<br /><br />I called Holy Stone cust serv and talked to a guy named Salmon who was very helpful and after we got over a small language barrier<br />He told me that they were sending me another drone package with a good controller and maybe I will get lucky and the drone in the<br />box will be good too. He was right. The controller that came worked perfectly and the drone in the box worked just fine too. So now I<br />have 2 good drones for the price of 1 and I have ordered a second controller for 30 bucks from amazon.<br /><br />I intend to give the second drone and controller to a good friend of mine who has expressed interest in shall we say<br />droning around.,[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHHS2C5YAZ3HVMUBTL3O6QVLA3EQ,1516404796044,1,True

Every. Single. Time. So instead of crashing it, I pounded it into smithereens. Completely. Nothing left but a few large pieces<br />and a lot of tiny ones. And now I'm buying another one. So if you've got a short temper, don't buy this thing. It'll drive you crazy.<br />Got another one. Tried to fly it. First I had to calibrate it 10 times before it was satisfied and I could fly.

After a few more practice flights, will try without the beginner mode turned on.  Although my flight time was short today, mainly due to the wind picking up and causing the drone to use up the battery time to maintain excellent control of the drone and not forcing it to crash.

The startup procedure with calibration is fairly simple and you can start flying fairly quickly. Do NOT ever fly this drone indoors. I had several hard crashes into trees amd telephone poles my first few days of flying. This drone responds very abruptly so dont try to fly in in close spaces. It can fly fairly fast and has a decent range for the wifi. Realistically about 300 meters or so. The altitide hold and stabilization works very well, as does the return to home feature. I was pleasantly surprised how well it returns to the exact spot of takeoff. It holds up well through crashes so far. The only thing that broke very quickly for me was the landing gear's twist to lock function. I recommend setting up and leaving the landing gear on. I think it broke my 3rd or 4th time of removal and reinstall. I super glued it and just left it on. The blades are flexible and tough, having survived numerous crashes.

The Holy Stone worked just as it stated, and did even better than I was expecting.<br /><br />Ok, aside from the excitement about finally getting to fly, let me tell you about my experience with this Drone. First off, there are some really great videos online that make it easy to see how to operate. Not only that, but once you do start flying the system is very stable and extremely responsive. It has some great features (not all of which Ive tested yet) like the take off and land function. That feature alone will save you from replacing blades.

The calibration of the compass a little less so but was accomplished in a few minutes. Connecting with app on the phone was also straightforward.

I tried everything suggested by Customer Support (which is very good), but could not solve this problem.

Only challenge was the battery was drained just as I as getting into the flying experience, so definitely going to need more batteries.

769,5.0,A decent drone for beginners.  Outstanding customer service,"I bought this drone for a newly formed Drone Club at the middle school I work at.  We had purchased several other drones to get the kids started and to learn some basic principles of flight.  After graduating up past two other drone models, we started on this one.  After receiving it, I put everything together and flew it in my back yard just to test things out.  Satisfied, I brought it to school and presented it to the drone club.  I was embarrassed when I could not get it to complete the GPS calibration.  After many tries, we gave up, made a video of how we were trying to get it to calibrate.  I had contacted Holy Stone support and after they watched the video, they sent me a replacement.  Because it appeared the first one was defective, they told me to keep it for parts.  When the new one arrived, I again tested it in my back yard and all seemed good.  No GPS connection issues and it flew as expected.  On the next Drone Club day, I had one of the kids go through the set up process and GPS calibration.  No problems were encountered and it flew fine.  One the next attempt to fly, I set it up, moved to a new location and tried the GPS calibration.  If failed.  Nothing I did would make it calibrate successfully.  One of the kids tried it again and to my surprise, it calibrated without any problems.  To make a long story shorter, I discovered that the malfunctioning GPS calibration was my fault.  When I tested each drone at my house, I was wearing causal clothes.  When I was trying to fly it at the school, I was wearing a uniform.  Part of that uniform was a body cam attached to the chest area.  The body cam is held in place with a strong magnet under the uniform shirt.  The magnet was causing the drone calibration to malfunction.  It was completely my fault, not the drone or equipment.  To add to my ongoing embarrassment, I tried calibrating the first drone without the body cam and it worked flawlessly.  So to be fair, I contacted Holy Stone and told them what happened and I offered to send the replacement drone back.  Surprisingly, they told me to keep both!  That my friends is great customer service!  It wasn't even their problem but they took care of the client, me!<br /><br />So now about the drone.  It is an easy drone to fly.  the controller is larger than most but it fit snug and comfortable in my hands.  The camera controls were easy to use and the photos and videos were very good.  I got about 20 minutes of flight time on a fully charged battery in calm winds.  Shorter battery life when it was a bit breezy.  I leave the prop guard on because the kids are still learning.  I haven't seen that the prop guards have any adverse effect on the performance.  There are still a few features we haven't used (follow me, return to home, etc) so I can't comment on them.  But overall, I like the performance of the drone and would recommend it for a beginner or intermediate user.<br /><br />Thank you Holy Stone for your support and understanding!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AG3V7CDVIWYO5KJTDOSOISC26SWQ,1579403708180,0,True

After connecting, it was very cool. The app is easy to use and can save photos to phone and give you video feed. Has a cool follow me function excited to try.

Once I finally got it paired with the controller and my iPhone, it was pretty simple and worked pretty well.  But then after only a few uses one of the motors seized and would no longer turn.

798,5.0,Excellent choice for beginner,"I have wanted to purchased a drone for recreational use for quite some time.  Until I found the reviews for  the Holy  Stone HS100 I didn't think I would find a drone with a good camera and good navigation that also had beginner failsafe options.  I've had the drone for a few days and have flown four times.  My first flight was a bit of a letdown as I had trouble controlling the direction of flight.  Then I realized the problems I was encountering were of my own making.  Reading other reviews and watching videos had given me a lot of good information and pointers but I had missed one important point.  The right hand joystick controls forward, backward, right, left flight.  What I had missed, however, that the direction the camera is pointing is relevant.  If the camera is pointing away from you then the joystick movements mirror the directions the drone will fly.  Pull the joystick left and the drone will fly left, etc.  If you camera is facing you however, then the drone will fly in the opposite direction of the joystick control.  In other words, the camera's face will lead the drone to go left, right, forward or backwards as you direct it with the joystick.  Once I understood that then controlling the movement of the drone was a breeze.  I have been very pleased with the ""go home"" feature and as a beginner it's reassuring to know that it will return home automatically when the battery charge gets too low for safe flight.  All in all, I'm glad I waited for this drone to make my purchase and anticipate many happy hours of flight.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AERMALQ52CKACUP7PPMCQ2IYIJ7A,1561893869784,2,True

803,5.0,Features and Functionality,"I selected the HS100 drone from Holy Stone because it offered the features and functionality in which I was interested. It offered ease-of-use right out of the box as well as the power and stability for which I was hoping. The camera while being 720p takes relatively good quality pictures and the 90 degree adjustable tilt is an excellent feature.  The battery life is between 10 and 15 minutes, which is sufficient for my needs; I purchased additional batteries to extend flight time as needed. A draw-back is the recharge time for the batteries - 3-6 hours. Another short coming are the user instructions.  They are lacking in many areas.  One in particular is the assembly of the propellers; it does not go in to sufficient detail on securing the locking hub.  Fortunately there are You-Tube videos that cover all aspects of the assembly.  If the instructions pointed the user to the videos that would be a great start.

So based on my past experience, I decided to step up to the HS100 and I am certainly happy I did.  This thing is the most fun I have had flying drones so far.  GPS sure makes a great difference!<br /><br />You will see my first flight video here from take-off to landing. I was a little nervous, so please forgive some jerkiness. The day was overcast and there was a breeze.  Even with the breeze, the drone held position excellently while hovering due to the GPS.  Even when the drone was caught by a gust of wind, it would reposition back to the original hover point by itself.  You will notice I used the camera to demonstrate moving it up and down as well.<br /><br />The assembly was very straight forward and easy to understand.  It only involved assembling the propellers and propeller guards.  Unfortunately for me, I have large fingers and the assembly uses very small screws.  This presented a real challenge for me, but I was able to get it done.<br /><br />The camera is cool too.  While the drone is in the air, you can adjust the camera up or down to get the shot you want. You can take pictures or videos by using the transmitter control or your iPhone. iPad, or other capable devices. The photos and/or videos can be stored on the included TF card (micro SD) or on your phone or tablet.<br /><br />The size of the drone is larger than any of my previous drones.  Assembled, it is aproximately 19.5 inches wide, 19.5 inches long, and 7 inches high.  The motors seem to be more powerful than my other drones as well.  Additionally, the battery is much larger providing up to 15 minutes, almost double the flying time of my other drones.<br /><br />Can you tell I REALLY like it?","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ghMoHPJjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ghMoHPJjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ghMoHPJjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vFsPAO36L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vFsPAO36L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vFsPAO36L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81p8tOcaxWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81p8tOcaxWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81p8tOcaxWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGIGLHTXIGLDNF2HUYOIU5BH2C6A,1512158103241,2,True

Pictures are not crisp and areas of the pictures are washed out.<br /><br />Follow up comments - contacted Holy Stone about camera issue - I followed all of the recommendations they suggested with no success.  They offered to send a replacement part kit on 4/7 and a replacement camera on 4/17. To date I have not received either! I'm nearing the point of returning this product. The drone itself is very good but if you can't take a decent picture with it it defeats my purpose for having it.<br /><br />Follow up 4/30. After e-mail discussion with June at Holy Stone she sent me a part kit and replacement camera. The picture quality is much better with the new camera installed. Happy with my purchase now :) I must say Holy stone stands behind their product!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81X90iKGMvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81X90iKGMvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81X90iKGMvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ojXO3DfBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ojXO3DfBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ojXO3DfBL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGEB74VIVBPU3SC5PA7Q7DDVZVFA,1554477139948,1,True

824,5.0,The BEST drone for beginners,"I bought this drone back in October 2018 and it was waiting in the box for its time for 4 long months, as I was abroad.<br />In the 1st week of March 2019, I finally was back and could give it a try.<br />As a complete newbie to drones (it's my 1st drone), I was quite worried of crushing it right during the 1st flight.<br />However, Holy Stone HS100 proved all its positive reviews here and was very easy to fly and control.<br />I can not explain in words the joy I felt during the 1st flight. It was just awesome! You must feel it!<br />The 1st flight lasted about 14-15 mins, the 2nd and 3rd ones a bit shorter, 11-13 mins, as it has been a bit windy here recently.<br />I also checked the HS100's app's VR mode and it not only works, but gives you a feeling of being a pilot or a bird up in the sky.<br />Overall, my score is 10 out of 10. Will buy it again as a gift for friends/family.

We opened ours on Christmas day and assembled it the instructions were clear and it took around 30 minutes.  Make sure to have very thin Philips head screwdrivers to attach the legs.<br /><br />The app is very good and has instructions to calibrate the compass which are accurate but I still misread them a couple of times.  Luckily I had a 12 year old around to tell me I was wrong;)  On our maiden flight the drone worked well and responded to the controls effectively.  The camera was pretty cool and we got some good footage.<br /><br />Unfortunately I crashed the drown when the wind caught it and broke a part.

829,5.0,Great first drone when moving from 'toy' drones,"I purchased this after not crashing a few 30-50 dollar quad drones. The first thing that struck me was the size. It's big... and it has some weight to it which is a plus when flying in light gusts of wind. After getting GPS dialed in (which took about 30 seconds) it was airborne. The flight time is impressive. I'm guessing around 10-12 minutes depending on conditions and how hard your flying it. Order an extra battery if you buy this. Flying for 10-15 then waiting a few hours to fly again wasn't happening for me.<br /><br />Return Home is amazing. I've just flown it full throttle nearly out of site and when it loses comms with the remote... it waits a moment or two then cruises back.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Batteries has a charge meter built in to them<br />-Solidly built<br />-GPS - return home feature is awesome<br />-pan / tilt on the camera a really nice feature<br />Cons:<br />-Not super portable<br />-720p camera isn't very impressive but works well nonetheless<br />-need to be sure to STOP recording before powering drone off and removing sd card, otherwise the video can become corrupt<br /><br />Overall, I really like this drone.

832,3.0,A decent step up from a Sub $100 Drone,"Looking for a step up from a Target/Walmart $70 drone but don't want to drop over $1k on a DJI? Just starting out and want something with more features than a sub $100 drone? This is probably the drone for you.<br /><br />First of all, be realistic. This is a sub $500 drone. You're not going to get 4k video or a camera on a gimbal. You're going to get an ""OK"" drone.<br /><br />Flight: This drone handles pretty well. I spent a good hour zooming around the yard and taking it up to max FAA allowed altitude (400 ft). It handles much better than cheaper drones, which is what I expected. The dial on the left hand side of the controller adjusts your speed, which is great for beginners. You can start out slow until you get the feel for flying it and then increase the speed as your comfortable. I was able to quickly do figure 8's in a fairly quick and controlled manner. The controls are responsive enough that you can inch in and hover close to an object (as long as you keep visual line of sight, more on this in a bit). If you lose your orientation on the drone releasing both sticks halts the drone pretty quickly so you can get your bearings again. Overall, a very easy to fly drone.<br /><br />You'll need to register your drone with the FAA and and put your registration number on the drone, so budget in another $5 and skip the value meal at McDonalds.<br /><br />Battery life: I was getting between 10-15 minutes per battery (I have three), which is again, exactly what I expected given the specs from the manufacturer and the conditions I was flying in.<br /><br />Camera: The camera is 780p. It's not going to be crisp or clean like a 1080 or a 4k. The dial on the right hand side of the controller is used to tilt the camera up or down. No side to side panning is available. However, I noticed that at times the camera wouldn't respond to the controller signal to tilt. This seemed to happen the further the drone got away from the controller, which is a shame.<br /><br />The App: This is where points get lost. The app seems ok at first. If you're looking to do FPV flying, this is NOT the drone you're looking for. As I started flying the video on the app (On my iPhone 7+) was just ok. Several times I lost connection with the drone totally or the video would just freeze. At first I thought this was due to distance, but even in a small radius of under 100 feet, the app would lose connection to the drone. For the price of the drone, I would have expected the app to function better. Because of this, flying FPV is at your own risk, best to have a spotter with you.<br /><br />Overall: As the title says, if you're looking to step up from sub $100 drones to something a bit more full featured, you'll be happy with this drone. Easy to fly and responsive. The lower end camera is a bit of a disappointment, but this falls in to the realm of ""getting what you pay for."" The app needs some serious work to make this drone ready for FPV, which is advertised.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711er74xhXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711er74xhXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711er74xhXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AE5CIYNYCTCFWIVWI5FQQ4DBTRDQ,1537237185476,13,True
833,5.0,Great Value Drone - Easy Operation,"First Drone.  I waited until the prices dropped from the super expensive units, to more reasonably priced units.  I was not disappointed with this purchase.  The limited assembly required my eye glass readers to get the small screws in the pre drilled holes, but that was the only hurdle for me.  The booklet supplemented by the video at their website made for an easy setup and first flight.  I will be using the beginner mode until I get the hang of it, but all in all it was simple simple simple to operate.  Hooking up to my android phone with their app was easy once connected to the HS100 wifi.  Camera worked well.  Assisted take off and landing was excellent.

After getting it I flew it a couple of times to try learning it and crashed it quite a few times.<br /><br />Now with the pandemic and being at home more, plus fair weather I decided to take the drone back out after reading the instructions and watching videos and I have to say this time it is a dramatically different experience.  I'm still learning but after changing flight modes to something that worked better for me as a gamer.<br /><br />After getting over this learning curve I have been able to use the drone to survey the roof of my house, as well as a couple of other family members, and have fun ""chasing"" my niece/nephew and dog around the yard.  With as much fun that I'm having I wish I took the time to learn how to use it better much sooner.<br /><br />My original battery that I barely used failed to a point of not recharging, but it was easy to find and order additional batteries, which also makes it easier to enjoy being able to fly more and while different batteries recharge.

855,5.0,"Fun Drone, AMAZING SUPPORT, (still reviewing)","(Update: 7/8/19)<br />Finally had a day to test. Did a head to head test with drone A (replacement drone sent by support) vs drone B (Original Drone received). I was correct, drone B does have issues; Home still does send the drone to the skies until disengaged (today, however, was the 1st day that descend worked properly after disengaging Home), but drone A worked great with Home. I was able to try both drones several times and each time, same scenario, drone A flew right back to home, drone B just went straight up.<br />Thank you to Holy Stone for your amazing support. You backed your product and that goes a long way.<br /><br />(update: 7/4/19)<br />Holy Stone's support has been great! I can certainly say that, as another drone has been sent out / received (MUCH APPRECIATED!). UNFORTUNATELY I've only had one day to test - we've been pretty windy the last couple days, so I've flown one day. Here's what I can take from that process:<br />For some reason, I'm not sure if it was me or not, but the new drone went together flawlessly. The 1st one had problems with the caps on top of the rudders, only one would fit correctly, the other three seemed to have a slight gap. Drone 2, the rudder caps went on perfect, smooth, easy, and super flush.<br />My only flight seemed okay. I didn't go too crazy, but one VERY important thing seemed to work correctly, descend, however, I only tried Home once, but disengaged function to fly a bit more.<br />I'll definitely update as I fly and use the Home function - just too windy lately to safely fly without waking up at 6am.<br />I'm updating my score a point for the great support from Holy Stone and how smoothly setup went - however, I will update as I have the opportunity to fly more - hopefully another point (to 5) as my confidence hopefully grows wt the 2nd drone.<br />(Side note: bought a Holy Stone micro drone and LOVE IT!)<br /><br />(Initial review)<br />Stable flight, decent camera though very slow to change viewing angle. Most everything about this drone is solid but one important function, 'Home'. When my drone is 50'+ away from me, the Home sends the drone straight up. I can hit Home a 2nd time and the operation will stop as will the drone's assention. But when I hit Home again.... straight up again! I have noticed that Home will work within a 15' to 30' range - everthing else will work as well BUT when this error happens, the descend doesn't work properly either.<br />Due to my experiences, I don't trust this drone to come back when the Home button is pressed nor do I with a low battery. I will follow the FAA protocol and NEVER let this drone out of my line of site, although when I first experienced the Home issue, that drone just kept going up and up, so high I could barely see it. At that time I discovered something else. The descend (left joystick down) doesn't work well either in conjunction with the home issue. Instead of holding the left joystick down, i have to toggle from center to down, and come down about 15, 20 feet at a time.<br />The support sent me new remote but that didn't fix the problem. So for me, I won't ever use Home, it seems to mess the drone up. I told my support agent that it's still happening but as long as I know what to expect, I'll deal with it as it is a lower cost, medium sized drone. I'm not going to claim I'm satisfied with it, but who knows, perhaps it's the park I'm going to? Will revise my review if my experience improves.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFX26C6Y2JJ77EIC4XQAUZPG3IXQ,1561580151746,1,True

857,1.0,Disappointed with battery quality and customer service,"I received this drone for a Christmas 2018 and flew it once after getting it. It then sat in storage until Memorial Day 2019 when I tried to charge the battery it would not charge, only showing the indicator lights shown in the attached photo. I called Holy Stone customer service only to be informed that the drone was out of warranty and that I must have overcharged the battery. I explained that I only used the drone once within a month of purchase and I was careful about charging the battery. The customer service agent said I could not prove I had only flown it once. I offered to send him the flight log from my Holy Stone app showing only one flight in December and he said it wouldn’t help because it was out of warranty and told me to buy another battery from Holy Stone.<br /><br />I’m very disappointed that the battery went bad after one flight and that after all the positive reviews left on Amazon about Holy Stone customer service they were not willing to be helpful.<br /><br />Based on my experience I will not buy another HS product and recommend if you are considering an HS that you look elsewhere, probably DJI.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ham2dqlXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ham2dqlXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ham2dqlXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFK7QF54NQCY2WILGLGG264CSC7A,1558818212572,2,False
858,4.0,Easier to use and more sophisticated than I expected,"My family got me the HS 100 GPS for my birthday.  This may be a toy, but a very sophisticated toy and a riot to use!  The automatic take off and landing, and return to home features really shorten the learning curve, and the compass, GPS, and gyroscope make flying a breeze.  Just take it easy when you first start.  Don't make your first flight where there are lots of things to run into.  The toughest thing is probably keeping the joystick controls straight.  It's not difficult, just takes some getting used to.  The pictures it takes are surprisingly clear and sharp.  This drone exceeded my expectations in all ways but one: the battery life.  You get about 20 minutes of flight from a full battery.  Right now the company is offering a free spare battery if you leave a review on Amazon.  Buying additional batteries is expensive, but you will have so much fun with this drone you may find them to be a good investment.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGNOCSKF2TZL4MV42VWYB2CO2GYA,1590246347521,0,False

887,4.0,Great drone for the price point!,"This drone is very good for the money. I am new to the drone hobby but have enjoyed it greatly.  I have a Yuneec Breeze and a Force 1 F100 Ghost. The Yuneec is great as a &#34;selfie drone&#34;that has gps but not much fun other wise. It is slow and not challenging to fly (Good or bad). The Force1 F100 is a fun drone with no gps.  It us powerful and very challenging to fly, especially when there is wind. Fun but nerve wracking!  This HS 100 is a great balance between the two. It has the power of the F100 (even more) and the GPS capability of the Breeze. At this price point it is an awesome drone that can make a user feel confident that they will not lose it due to the GPS capability. Minus 1 star for SLIGHTLY difficult to install blades, camera image quality, and long charging time for battery.  However overall very happy with this purchase!",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFH4CXJEYHFK3D2PSDMPU4RFJI5Q,1524640632949,3,True
888,3.0,Might as well get a dj phantom.,For this price might as well she'll out $200 more and get a dj phantom. Why do drones have Auto takeoff and Landing auto return home GPS satellite positioning it's because you need computer assistance to fly them (fly by wire).  So don't waste your money on any drone that doesn't at least have all of these features. That's my opinion.  I've wasted alot of money on cheap drones.,[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFJNU6475LTGFZRROAOOZI6ZSOCA,1519909900086,2,True

890,4.0,Decent drone with good features for the $$,"This is a good drone with plenty of power and ~15 minutes of flight time.  The 720p camera leaves something to be desired in this day and age of digital photography.  The gimbal control is decent and is goodfor getting the proper video angle.  Press and HOLD the button to move the camera up and down the gimbal.  The 1080p camera upgrade is worth it if you're into photography and video.  FPV is... a... BLAST!  Fly the drone while someone else wears the FPV for a VR experience... or wear it yourself for the perfect photo/video shot.<br /><br />This is a great drone unless you plan to fly it over water (I live lakeside).  I have found a scenario that will put the drone into a direct descent that cannot be aborted until it hits the ground (or in my case the water).  Fortunately the drone bounces right back up (believe it or not on both land and water) and is immediately controllable.  The battery is decent with a good LED level indicator.  It only comes with 1 battery and replacements are not cheap.<br /><br />Range is limited if using a phone connected to the drone via WiFi.  I have not tested the range without the phone connected as it is difficult to calibrate the drone without the phone and if you're taking video or pictures, the phone is essential otherwise you're shooting in the blind.<br /><br />I have stuck with Holy Stone for my intermediate drone purchases (as well as a couple of others) for their durability (it bounced off the lake and made it to shore!), cost, features, and customer support (Camille is awesome and responds pretty much the same day with a smile that shows through email.  They even offered to replace a drone that I sunk in the lake but it was honestly my fault and I couldn't in good conscious let them do that.  I'm moving to DJI for my personal hobby drone but that is apples compared to oranges.  I have 3 boys ages 9-12 and will purchase Holy Stone drones for them for several models to come","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713nP5uOF2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713nP5uOF2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713nP5uOF2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OlPKHTsdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OlPKHTsdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OlPKHTsdL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YN++Ml8uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YN++Ml8uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YN++Ml8uL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zeGLeSn9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zeGLeSn9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zeGLeSn9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C1Yp3mN3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C1Yp3mN3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C1Yp3mN3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHLH4NFQE4FMKMM7CDTT4HVL6XDQ,1538546625868,0,True

I just pushed the landing button again to manually correct the drone where I want it to land and then hit the landing button once more for a smooth touchdown.

Good video and even with the wind gusts we had today It is a very stable drone.  The size and weight along with the powerful motors keep it stable.

934,5.0,Great starter drone if you are on the fence.,"This thing is amazing for the price! Got it on a lightning deal. I was looking at toy drones for sometime now, but they always fall short no gps or gyro.<br /><br />When I saw the specs on this thing GPS, gyro, compass, auto takeoff / landing, and long flight time I had to pull the trigger.<br /><br />I was expecting it to be a joke but after flying this thing around I would say it delivered. The unit flys stable and stays put with only slight drift when you take your hands off the controls. The battery life delivers 15-20mins of fly time. I have flown it in 15mph wind and was able to control it. Auto take off and landing works every time.<br /><br />I also crashed it into a 4x4 wood post due to wind sheer and it kept flying no damage (was flying with no prop gard). No damage at all.<br /><br />Now for the two things that I don’t care about (also knew about when I purchased). But if you are looking for this it maybe a deal breaker. The camera isn’t that good from what I have seen with day and night tests. The second thing is battery charging takes some time due to usb cable charging only. Takes me about 4 hours at 2amps.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AG3MX3NZVUI4PJQ2TK6ZFEJNHNPA,1523017717238,0,False

The technology that is in this drone for the price is amazing. I really like the return home function especially if you loose site of your drone. Hit return home and it will ascend to the predetermined altitude you set in the app and come right back to where you took off from. Another great feature is the return home on low battery or loss of controller signal. NOTE: The drone will take the most direct route back to its take off spot when it returns for low battery, so if there are obstacles in the way, I suggest if you get the low battery warning hit the return home button. It will then rise to the predetermined altitude. The only negative I can say is it takes about four hours to charge the battery. I bought several extras to increase my daily flying times. I highly recommend you buying this drone.

It is easy to learn and control.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61253dMULdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61253dMULdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61253dMULdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61H-bTNB4rL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61H-bTNB4rL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61H-bTNB4rL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGHQHGHM2X2M7ATLWXBOJKQCIZ2A,1521819212928,0,True

980,4.0,What a great support Team as well as product,"I purchase the HS 100 drone and I must say that I have had an exceptional experience with both drone and support team.  I received my drone for my birthday and went through the easy to follow instructions.  Starting on Beginner Mode you are limited as to the distance you can fly.  After a few weeks and many camping trips, as I am retired, I used the Beginner mode for quite a while.  Without realizing it, and frankly, not using the drone much, I tried to move it from Beginner Mode to Pro Mode allowing for more range of flight.  I am not using this drone for commercial purposes but really hobby.  I tried and tried to move it from Beginner to Pro with no results and it would always default to Beginner.  I called up Support and and received some of the best instruction from several different people.  All were very helpful but alas, no solution could be found.  After 6 attempts on one flight the drone went nuts and flew into a tree, I had been using the ""Follow me"" feature at the time.  One of the agents for Holy Stone had contacted me to get more info and I informed the agent that the drone was no more and I expected to be dropped like a hot potato but to my surprise the agent passed my information along to the Techs but also up the chain.  The result astounded me as the company contacted me and had decided to send me a new drone even though it was 1 month out of warranty.  Even there follow up since has been great and I am a Holy Stone fan as they are people of their word.  Thank you Holy Stone from San Antonio, TX and this household.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zE025GLIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zE025GLIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zE025GLIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFMWLI4ZY4L4VDKDMYTZWBK5WBTQ,1576272610059,0,True

Flown it at least twice a day during my spare time and work from home conditions we're in to blow off some steam.  Every time i fly i get a new experience and a new level of confidence out of a good 15 minute fly time.  Only thing i didnt expect was how steady the video is as well as photography.  I am definitely looking forward to my upgrade with Holy Stone in the near future.  I absolutely feel i made a great buy.  Note: transmitter on first, then drone, set wifi on your device, open your APP, a quick calibration with your drone and you are flying.

989,5.0,Pretty Cool,"Melissa Jacob &#60;mellie2880@gmail.com&#62;<br /><br />Sun, Aug 26, 1:21 PM (3 days ago)<br /><br />Total Drone newbie.  Wanted to get one to oversee construction of new home from above.  Overall, this is a really neat device.  If you are TOTALLY new to drones and have never used one and have no help from anyone that has used one, just know to be patient in some parts of the assembly and setup.  Read instructions and seek out YouTube videos for help.  It is well worth it when you are done with setup.  But here are some things I learned:<br /><br />First step - Charge your controller and your drone battery.  Do this FIRST.  Both use USB cord provided, but only one is provided, so you will need two.  My battery came ~3/4 charged and my controller was fully charged.<br /><br />Second step is drone assembly:  1) putting on propellers.  This is the most difficult part.  The screws provided - those in the same bag as the  black fixed ring) are quite small.  It took me a good half an hour to do all four propellers, but you get better as you go along (screwdriver provided is magnetic and does help with attaching screws.  Just be patient and make sure you have something to catch the screw because it will fall before you finally get it screwed in, and you don't want it to bounce.  They do provide extra screws, but just make sure you work with something under you to catch the screw.  The rest of the assembly is easy (2)  propeller guards, 3) push in CHARGED battery).  4) Landing gear comes already assembled as does SD card.<br /><br />Third step is pairing with your phone (I haven't yet tried it without phone).  I have iPhone 7.<br />1) Download the Holy Stone app on your phone - free<br />2) Turn on the controller<br />3) Turn on the battery on the drone - the lights on the battery will indicate charge level - 4 lights is fully charged; the lights on the drone will flash white and pink/red before successful pairing and calibration<br />4) In your phone settings, go to your WIFI and select the Holy Stone WIFI signal<br />5) Open the Holy Stone app and click the enter device button in the center of the opening page of the app<br />6) CALIBRATE THE DRONE - this part did not work for me a couple of times, but it was MY fault.  I was rotating the drone the wrong way.  Make sure you watch the Holy Stone You Tube videos to get this part right)<br /><br />Calibrate step #1:  With the drone sitting on the ground normally, rotate the drone counterclockwise in this plane - stand over it and look down on it aerially, and rotate it as it stands on the ground counterclockwise like you are turning off a faucet.  Two of the lights on the drone should stop blinking and turn blue when this is successful.<br /><br />Calibrate Step #2: This is where I messed up---- rotate the drone with the propeller guards perpendicular to the ground (turn the drone 90 degrees as if it is on its side) and rotate the drone with the propeller guards rotating in a plane parallel to the ground - do not rotate the drone as if you are turning a car steering wheel which is what I did.  Watch the video and it is clear.  Once you rotate the drone successfully the second time, the second two lights stop blinking and turn white. So you have all 4 lights on the drone not blinking; two of them are white and two of them are blue.<br /><br />If you are inside (which I don't recommend unless it is a big space) you have to turn off the GPS button (button with compass picture on it on the controller on the left side) as you don't get GPS inside.  Just go outside to an area that is free of trees, phone/electrical lines, etc.<br /><br />You are ready to fly.  Get familiar with the controls (up and down, left and right, rotate).  This part was actually the easiest.  The Follow me function worked great!  Really neat and actually a little creepy....  The video and picture buttons also worked fine - in fight, press the video or picture button to record the flight (video needs to be off to take a picture).  These videos and pictures went directly to my iPhone camera Roll.<br /><br />The battery life was about 15 min.  This is typical.  Go get extra batteries.  I have also learned the rotating part to calibrate is also typical of drones.  But once you have done it once, it is super easy to do it again.  All of these instructions are probably unnecessary for those that have used a drone at least once before in their life.  These are meant for those that have NEVER touched a drone.  And you should only need these instructions once...<br /><br />I recommend planning your fight a little before you start as battery life is precious,  The drone lights will start blinking red when the battery is low, and if you are using your phone, the drone and controller battery life is shown in the app.<br /><br />So very happy with my purchase.  Seems like a good mid-range drone for a hobbyist,  Can't wait to see the videos from our construction.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF4XQIRY7UIGV5QNL3Y3WUZJQ6FA,1535595721116,4,True

1014,3.0,"OK toy, but lacks features and app compatibility.","Our initial unit had a bad remote. At 1st it seemed to connect, but we did not make it through the calibration before it lost connection and nothing worked to get them synced up again. The remote would make its beeps and light up as if connected, but the drone's lights stayed red and the app said low battery on the remote. We tried recharging multiple times and even with other chargers and it was always the same. The 1st reply from Holy Stone was a form letter with the instructions from the manual. Then they asked for video of the issues to arrange a return. At that point we just setup a return with Amazon. Once we told HS about the return they were suddenly interested in helping resolve the issue and offered to send a new remote, and if that did not work a new drone. I had already disassembled everything and boxed it up, but went ahead and cancelled the Amazon return to give them a chance to fix things. The new remote arrived and it did connect, so I reassembled everything and tried it out. It was able to fly and seemed an OK toy. The video connection was spotty, and I did not have it up that high, but in range it looked decent. My biggest issue is that I recently moved and was planning to use this to help mark a straight property line through some trees using the advertised ""GPS assisted flight: Provides you with accurate positioning details of your drone."" (1st bullet point in the description at the time of this review). After I got the drone connected and working I looked at the flight log and found it only had very basic info that looked to be the average altitude, speed and the flight time of each flight. The was no positioning data at all. I contacted them again to ask about this and was told only 700 models had that functionality and that no other Android apps were compatible with their drones. After quoting the description they said they would contact the main office and let me know. After almost a week I decided that this had been enough hassle and requested a refund. They said to just do so through Amazon. My main reason for not waiting longer was to ensure I could do a refund through Amazon and that they were not trying to drag things out past the return window.<br /><br />In summary, the drone is not great and I would suggest going with DJI or similar (which is what we will be doing) and support can be good depending on who you get, but overall I cannot recommend buying from Holy Stone.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHNZPJJ3QRVRKZY6HP6YDY4SAT6A,1569264954193,0,True

The instructions are clear and assembly was easy.  So far, the drone functions seem to behave as advertised.  The GPS functions work well.  In my usage to date I have found only a few issues that I can comment on.  First is image quality.  The images and movies, even on the on-board SD card, are highly compressed, so the still picture quality is not what it could be.  Also, for the videos especially, the colors do not seem to be as vivid as they should be.  Perhaps there is an adjustment somewhere to modify the record quality of the video and images, but I could not find it.  Second, the stored video format and codec for the movies do not allow them to be imported into iMovie.  I will need to download a video converter to convert the video to a compatible format in order to make video clips with image stabilization.  Overall, the price point and quality of the HS-100 is pretty remarkable given its features.  Lastly, the battery life seems to be as advertised, but the recharge time is 4-5 hours, also as advertised.  This drone was a gift, had I ordered it myself I would have purchased an extra battery, because 10-15 min of fly time is generally not adequate for me to get a filming session just right.  The extra battery is a must in my opinion, and I will be ordering the two-pack that is available for this drone.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AH7GAPSS7IS2UF674JRA2IAA3VRA,1543491189779,0,False

It flies very nicely, very stable under automatic GPS control, yet easy to maneuver when not.  I had it up in the mountains once and between the wind and peaks there was no GPS and it was being buffeted all over the place.  Despite this I was able to fly it accurately w/out running into any of the trees that surrounded us.  I love the video that it takes and the integration with my iPhone 7.  It's a great little app that runs it and it's very communicative letting you know what's going on with the drone through the video feed and the scroll at the bottom that gives the current drone status.  The battery takes a little longer to charge up than the other two did but it also runs about 5 minutes longer which is appreciated.<br />Overall it's been a great drone and I'm having a great time with it.

1052,5.0,Best budget drone for beginners,Before buying the HS100 I did my research on what is the best drone out there. The things I was look were easy to fly durable and must have a great camera. The HS100 has all of this things. Right from beginning I calibrated the drone and found how easy and fast it took to setup and fly it took at least 5 minutes in total to get up in the air (it may take you less time I just needed to make sure I did it correctly). The second thing that impressed me about the HS100 is the durability. While starting up my drone for the first I got my drone stuck on a tree. I managed to bring it but it took a nasty fall. I thought that was it since it was a cheap Chinese drone but that was not the case. To my surprise The HS100 took that fall like a champ and still worked normally. The final thing that impressed me was the camera. Although 2k the camera shows really great quality photos and videos the stability can be improved on but this is old drone so I didn’t expect much of it and for the price it was met many of expectations.<br /><br />Recently I needed a part for my drone so I hit up holy stone directly and got a very quick response. I see many reviews about how holy stone has the worst customer service but I am here to put all that to rest. Holy stone customer service went above and beyond for me to find the part that I needed for my HS100.

After about 8 hours of flying, and hundreds of movies, while flying around a soccer goal post the drone stopped flying and fell about 7 feet to the ground. The camera popped off, but worse, one of the wires from the camera connector pulled out. Impossible to repair. I emailed Holy Stone. After exchanging several emails, they offered to send me a replacement (720p vs the 1080p) camera - I thought. I was surprised when a box with a NEW HS100 (780p) arrived!!!

1058,5.0,***stay tuned***,"*****NEW UPDATE*****  Holy Stone reaches out to me and decided that they would replace my lost drone on good faith!!!  After emailing back and forth, I got a new one!!!!!  Thanks to a great company!!!!  So simple to use, absolutely an enjoyable experience from takeoff!  ****UPDATE— I was flying my drone one morning at about 20-30 ft altitude, not more than 40-50 ft away from me, when for some reason the drone gained enough altitude to get into the winds of a storm front that had passed through hours earlier.  Long story short, I was attempting to get it back to me and it was laboring and making minimal progress.  I didn’t want to dump it, so instead of that, I decided to hit “ return to home”.  Immediately, my drone gained altitude WAY beyond the limits I set of 40 ft return, made it to 100+ ft altitude and quit resisting the winds, instead it appeared to take on a mind of its own and go with the winds.  I chased after it trying feverishly to dump the remote and make it crash land all to no avail.  As it went out of sight, I couldn’t help wonder why it didnt have better fail safes in place to prevent loss of product.<br /><br />HOLY STONE— make it right with me.  Help me get back to flying drones, Holy Stone products.  Otherwise I will look elsewhere to find a much safer, trustworthy brand.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGH7Y7PY3HEPX623A7OZQCVCZJTA,1541659535455,0,True

1061,3.0,Great beginner drone,"Update: 30 June 2020 - Got it working and after multiple attempts it seems to be agreeing with my phone. Had to go through the steps and got a wifi not safe warning but just pressed OK.  Anyway took it up and it handled the windy day decently.  The degree of set up trial and error is frustrating but I think it may be working now.  Overall if you want to learn then this may be an option not overly costly and will make your flying skills work hard.  Any other more expensive drone would then be a dream to fly.  Good luck and have a great flight.<br />Update June 4, 2020:  Received a Free replacement drone.  This one does record on the micro SD card.  However the remote to my phone still says the battery on the drone is empty even though it is fully charged. It does fly for about 15 minutes. Overall an inexpensive drone to learn with but the connections are not the best via the Android phone. 64 bit phone with 64 gig card and wifi connected. Motoforce 2Z phone. I will see how the new MAVIC Mini does compared to the HolystoneEasy to set up and have fun with my kids learning to operate and fly a drone.  I may look into a more advanced drone once we get things figured out on our skills of operation.  Update: Returned the drone for a refund. I have bought a Mavic instead. I have had a change for the worse.  The camera would not record any video no matter what card I put in it 2g, 4g, 8g , 16 g etc.  All the cards were formatted and worked in dashcams, video cameras and my phone. Still no video.  The wife connection was nearly impossible to achieve after the first flight. The remote would show low battery voltage and not connect to the phone. The phone is a motoforce 2z 64bit with Android 7.1.1 and has all the requirements to operate. Of course the good reviews may be deemed from the fact that they offer free batteries for reviews.  I never got a battery as they said it would take up to a month to get it to me from CHINA and they had batteries in stock on amazon ready in less then 3-4 days.  Not sure what is going on with this Holy Stone company but this has been my experience.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pHey+tRjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pHey+tRjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pHey+tRjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pHey+tRjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pHey+tRjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71pHey+tRjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tej9XkvTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tej9XkvTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tej9XkvTL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF5CDL2VXCCRPFDCX6EHGBYWAM4A,1590422903507,0,True

The auto-takeoff and return to home feature are fantastic for new users.  I’ve especially liked it in those moments when I’ve panicked the first few flights.  (Watch out for the wind, it will affect the GPS on your return to home landing). I’ve had so much fun flying my first drone so far!

We actually got it caught in a tree but after we got it down, we got it right back into the air.<br /><br />I flew it for the first minute or so and handed it to my son and he flew it until the battery died.  In all, I think we got 10-12 minutes of flying time.<br /><br />For the money, I would definitely recommend this drone.  This is our first drone and I would agree that it is fairly simple to fly.

Very easy to fly. Also takes great pictures. Has a fly home feature when the battery is getting low, so you won’t loose the drone. Also has a follow me feature.

I came across this one on Amazon, it was only $135 with the coupon! I read some good reviews on the HS 100 and decided to give it a shot. I am glad I did. When I took it out of the box, I was impressed by the quality. It looks and feels well made, and sturdy. This drone was easy for a beginner to set up and use Within 45 minutes, I read through the instructions and set the whole thing up.  Day one I was up and flying in an open space by my house. The app that you can download is easy and fun to use. The 2k camera takes good pictures and video as well.

The drone is one of their larger models and is easy to handle. This is not like some of the other ones I bought for friends and family that had a more sports like the design. This is excellent for flying around, taking nice pictures and videos to enjoy. I live near the woods, so it is nice taking pictures of nature around my house. The GPS feature is pretty cool because it will follow you around if that mode is on. Hovers well in place and is responsive to whatever you do. The one feature I love is how the controller now can be charged and no longer need AA batteries. My wife was getting annoyed with how many batteries I was buying for all the toys I buy on Amazon, and this a lone was an excellent addition.<br /><br />Read the directions for the drone and make sure you take your time learning how it operates before you go crazy.

1142,5.0,Sturdy entry level camera drone!,"First, I have to mention that this is my first camera style drone. I have played around with the little $30 mini drones but never one with these features and capabilities. I have had this drone for 2 days so far and taken it up 4 different times so far.<br /><br />When I got the drone I found the assembly was easy (once I realized the prop blades were on the underside of the box). The box included a bunch of spare parts, including a second full set of props and a second set of landing skids. The written instructions on how to pair the drone, app, and controller were not detailed enough for me but there were a ton of youtube videos that demonstrated this. After watching one I was able to get the drone flying easily. The cell phone clamp will just barely hold my samsung galaxy s9+ with a otterbox defender case. I am REALLY impressed with this drones durability. The first time I took this drone up I did not pay attention to how low the battery had gotten and I started to lose power before I could land. The drone made a VERY rough landing on its skids from about 15 feet and the drone took it like a champ. Since then I have kept a MUCH closer eye on my battery indicator and have not had any additional mishaps since then. The battery life seems fairly accurate from the description and I am getting between 12 and 15 minutes of flight time per charge. The battery seems to charge from drained to full in about 4 hrs using the included cable and a standard cell phone USB wall charger. I am planning on purchasing additional batteries since they are really easy to swap on the fly. The camera, while not the best, does a reasonable job of taking pictures and video. One complaint I do have is that when you are recording video the app beeps every 2-4 seconds as a reminder. While on short video clips this doesn’t bother me to much, when recording longer video clips I find it can be distracting. Another thing I have noticed is that I can look at pictures taken by the drone on my cell phone but I usually have to pull the drones SD card to watch the videos. Again, since 99% of what I do with this drone is take photos this is not a big deal but I feel it does need to be mentioned. The flight controls are really easy and I am more than comfortable with the range of the drone. I have taken it up to an altitude of 60 meters and flown it a distance of 30 meters away. I might get comfortable enough to fly it where I can’t see it but I am not willing to do that yet.<br /><br />Over all I have been enjoying this drone very much.

1143,1.0,Never really performed well,"First time out, drone failed to hover properly. After a few seconds, the drone would drift into an everwidening circle, becoming increasingly unstable, and only responded when checked repeatedly with the controls. After about 40 days (ten days after the warranty expired), one of the motors failed. I ordered a replacement motor and began a laborious and eventually fuitless effort to fix the unit. I think there was something wrong with the unit at the outset, but I didn't know enough to recognize it.  My lesson learned is that you get what you pay for. I was disapointed that my first drone experience turned out so negatively. Would not buy again from Holy Stone.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFBBKSJVKXM5GWOQLMH427DICG5A,1615568000104,1,True

1148,5.0,The key functionalities of this drone can be learned much faster than other drone.,"I bought this drone because the Holy Stone brand is given high praise and stellar reviews from several drone /tech sites and also larger well known tech sites. The HS100 drone is very easy to learn to fly and is larger and more stable than any drone in its price range. The selling point of the HS100 is its GPS, follow me function, 15 minute flight time, and headless mode. All of these characteristics in this drone are amazing features that go well beyond the given price range. Honestly spending more would probably get you a better camera (1080P), but you would not get a drone that has a better flying experience and ease of use in this range....totally worth buying the Holy Stone HS100 Drone, money well spent.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61W4NPvw+uL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61W4NPvw+uL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61W4NPvw+uL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF6J7QALUV5FI7XG52OYWWFNB3NQ,1611272200470,0,True

All the extra features that come with this package will cost you an arm and a leg if it was through another company. I haven't had a chance to fly the drone yet since it was delivered late. BUT assembly was straightforward, and it didn't take long to have it ready to fly. Also the controls are simple enough for someone who has never flown before to understand. I highly recommend this purchase even if your new flying drones. Another plus is the customer service at Holy Stone cannot be beat, any issue you may have can be fixed.<br />The only thing I noticed after taking it out of the box under good lighting is that there where scuff marks on the drone, but after contacting Holy Stone within minutes they immediately rectified this matter.

1157,1.0,BEWARE!!!,"The propeller assembly is a real PAIN to put on!  It consists of a copper washer, a teeny TINY screw, a spacer, and of course the propeller blade.  One must line up a hole in a silver pin with a hole in the spacer, THEN somehow manage to insert the tiny screw so it will remain while you fumble with an accompanying phillips head screwdriver in order to line up with the screw head and turn until it is firmly secured.  Then the exposed spacer with the screwhead is sealed with a cap.  THIS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH.  This is MICROSURGERY you're performing here, and those with sausage fingers and/or poor vision may be in for a real struggle.  The drone comes with extra screws and spacers, but no wonder!  You'll lose a LOT of them, especially if you crash the drone and destroy the fragile propeller blades, requiring replacement (BTW, don't be too hasty in throwing away the styrofoam packing.  Extra blades are included, underneath and inside the material)!  In addition, the package containing the copper washers had some kind of gooey lubricant inside, probably meant as a lubricant for the blades.  This got on my fingers, and in turn, in my eyes, on my face, etc. (and it burned).  I thought I might use it to keep the miniscule screw on the tip of the screwdriver, but no.  BRAINSTORM: I do have a pack of gum.  Maybe I will chew a stick, then use a bit of the wad to steady the screw just at the hole while I screw it in (Don't laugh.  I AM NOT a watch repairman.  Most of us aren't.)  WISH ME LUCK.

It maneuvered pretty good, the return to home feature is really helpful. The video quality is quite good as long as you keep it straight going, once you start doing a lot of zigs and zags the video gets a little grainy. For some reason I could not take good photos but I don't want to say the camera is bad yet. I have only been able to fly it a few times but so far I have loved it. I would love to take it out on a mountain or near the beach to test it on a bigger surface area.<br />I sincerely hope they improve the battery life on this, I got around 13 mins of flying time and it was too short.

1188,5.0,Best value for money..!!!,"I totally loved it, it is very powerful and nicely built drone. It is really sturdy. I crashed into walls 2 times and nothing happened to even propellers. it is a good drone to start with, I am a beginner this is my first drone after simulator and I am off to a good start. I really loved the app, it shows the status of the remote battery, drone battery, GPS location on the map, and a crisp cam image. I was really amazed by the image clarity. It has a setting to switch between beginner and pro flying mode which makes it a good fit for new bee like me.<br /><br />Just one thing, don't forget to buy a propeller guard if you are not so confident with your skills. I was using this in VR mode and didn't control it well and it crashed into my toe and got a cut. so for kids, be aware of what you are getting into. This drone is a really good piece.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615NPssLd5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615NPssLd5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615NPssLd5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b2mRq-rAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b2mRq-rAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b2mRq-rAL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jsfA9w3HL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jsfA9w3HL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jsfA9w3HL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nNJ2RWm3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nNJ2RWm3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nNJ2RWm3L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712HvaCkRML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712HvaCkRML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712HvaCkRML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718d8ZiZAQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718d8ZiZAQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718d8ZiZAQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DSY8CAPbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DSY8CAPbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DSY8CAPbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZfVrGMfnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZfVrGMfnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZfVrGMfnL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71odydIEHSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71odydIEHSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71odydIEHSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFWBC7JUF57X7RIXS6Q7ODS7G45Q,1589174778335,0,True

You will need to put on the blades and blade guards. The hardest part about that was holding those tiny little screws, lol. Batteries on reciever and drone charged, drone registered. Yes you have to register the drone with the FAA. Did it online, took 10 minutes and $5.00 and I had my numbers. Easy peasy. After following the calibration instructions the first flight went exceptionally well. The HS100 is responsive and very easy to fly. The follow me feature was a hoot. Almost like have a pet flying around following you.lol. And the RTH feature works very well. The drone comes to you very quickly stops near you and lands. Very cool indeed. The biggest reason my husband chose this drone was the camera. I have a small drone and the video is choppy at its best. Let me tell you what, the HS100's camera takes good pictures and decent video. I can actually use my VR headset with this drone and there's no choppiness! I absolutely LOVE the HS100. I have not found anything I don't like about this drone.

The assembly was easy and most parts for  assembly come with extra parts, a great touch. You can also access the video on the manufactures web page for additional instructions. We did have a problem at first pairing the drone to the controller, but the video helped to show what we were not doing correctly. It was very surprising when we first got the drone airborne at how hard it is to control the height and speed of the drone. My two year old Grandson just loved watching the drone and insisted it was a helicopter, not a drone. I can see having extra batteries for the drone is necessary, as you only get fifteen minutes of flight time and It goes fast. Charging the drone batteries takes about three hours, so extra batteries help greatly the flight time. The drone is made with plastic and appears to be a durable material, as he had some fast and hard crashes learning to fly the drone. However, a very windy day is not going to be good on controlling the drone due to it's light weight. Overall just seeing my Grandson's sheer delight in watching us fly the drone made this a very good purchase so far.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFKJRXOFCZRQYTDSUI2Y3ZPBC4XQ,1523283221832,0,True

I set all the parts out, identified them against<br />the parts listing, then put everything together.  Very easy assembly...<br />I watched a bunch of YouTube videos, then decided to take it to my local middle school field.  No wind, perfectly clear day.  Auto take off, auto land, auto take off, auto land.  Then, I decided to take a nice flight in the rookie mode.  All went well.  I was very surprised just how responsive it is.  Takes great pictures and very nice videos.  Even though you can retrieve the videos from the included micro-SD card, I prefer to record them on my iPhone.  That is certainly a nice feature.<br />After several weeks of flying, I realized that my camera was not articulating.  I checked online videos to verify that I knew what I was doing, I sent a message to Holy Stone customer support.  I was astounded just how quickly Iris Chen responded to my request.  She was very patient with me and my number of questions.  After verifying that it was indeed a problem with the camera, she sent another out.  I received the camera in a few days...After installing it, VOILA!  So impressed that it worked perfectly!  I am a true believer in their Customer Support.

1234,5.0,Great drone for just about anyone,"This is my 3rd drone I have owned, all different ones. The first one handheld terrible, and the mothers burned out after a little over a week. The second one was great, but a good gust of wind carried it away, and I never saw it again. Because of that I wanted a good drone that couldn’t fly away like that, and had a good camera. So after all of the reasearch I did I found this particular drone I knew it was the best bang for my buck. The features on the drone are frat, it is so simple, but still can do so much. The camera is really clear. It is great for people who are just getting into the hobby, or who want a good reliable drone. I really do love this model, and would strongly recommend it.<br /><br />The only issues I had were that the drone can only stay connected to your phone at about 30 meters, but that is still a really good distance to work with. I also had a small issue with the WiFi that connects to your phone, but my research into the issue showed that it is quite rare, and the customer serves rep was super helpful and fixed the problem with no extra charge.<br />This drone is 100% worth the money in my personal opinion, and I do not leave reviews often, or always so positive.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AG6KSMEZBCV7WQWLM2DUXQHBPYAQ,1527212921284,0,True

If I hadn't received this as a gift I probably would not have bought it myself, I generally era on the side of you get what you pay for and have learned a lot of hard lessons over the years of trying to go the cheaper route with products.  So far I believe this quad breaks that mold.<br /><br />I love all the fail safes this drone offers that protects it from a beginner like me from ruining it.<br />- Return home button:  I almost ran it into a pine tree and hit the button and it immediately turned around and came right back to me, tragedy avoided.<br />- Emergency landing button:  I was flying it low altitude and again almost ran it into some objects and didn't know if the return home would avoid them so hit the emergency landing button and it sets it self down rather quickly.<br />- You can set the parameters of altitude and distance it will go from you and if it will stop at what you set them for, very smooth.<br />- Feel like your getting out of control a little bit, let go of the sticks and it immediately stops, corrects itself, and holds position/altitude.<br />- Follow me button: It works well, haven't put this feature to the max potential yet but it worked well testing the feature.<br />- Camera: Holds steady and takes good clear pictures and video even when on the move.<br /><br />So far I love it.<br />Chris",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEM5B2KOOX4EJ5RK6XLDR25POIWQ,1521987018651,0,False
1253,5.0,A great drone for Beginners!,"I received this drone for Christmas, but couldn't use it until the middle of January, when temperatures ran into the 40's.  Preparing the drone for its first flight was easy, but the manual could have been a bit more precise about how the fixed rings fit in place for each rotor blade.  After figuring all that out, I just had to wait until the next day for it's maiden flight.<br /><br />I was very nervous and unsure about flying this drone for the first time, but with the app on my Android phone, I was easily able to set up the compass.  The app told me when the GPS signal was strong enough and the drone was ready to fly.  I hit One Button Take-off on the remote controller and we were in the air.  Thank goodness for Beginner Mode.<br /><br />While still getting used to the controls, I have found the HS100 to be very easy to fly.  Each new flight (I just finished my third run) I get more daring and venture further from the launch site.  The Return to Home feature works beautifully, as does the One Button Landing.  I have yet to try the Follow-me mode, as we have too many trees in the area.  I like that the drone lights flash red to warn you that the battery is low, prompting you to land as soon as possible.<br /><br />Overall, I would have to say that the HS100 is proving to be a great device for someone like me who is just starting out with a drone.  Once I get more comfortable with the controls, I will turn off Beginner Mode and see how much more I can do.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHVUZBM5RQHDVTZVS2LFQ4Z4I23Q,1519525459765,0,False

The follow me, return home and other control features makes the HS100 pilot friendly. The battery flight time averages more than 15 minutes. To extend my flight time I purchased additional batteries.

It is easy to fly and while i have yet to record a video with the camera I was able to take some good pictures with it.  Very well built and sturdy. The blades were a bit of a nuisance to put on but that is me being picky due to my big hands and the small screws that are used to secure the blades in place.  Thers have packaging it came in was convenient and I will say I was scared for a bit because I could not find the blades but they are on the bottom of the styrofoam.

Propellers were already installed.  The controller battery did have charge bu I plugged it in for about 20 minutes. The drone battery seemed to be charged as well. Read the manual a couple of times before launch just to be sure I knew what I was doing. The GPS defiantly saved me in this wind which is why I did not take it too high. Ran for about 15 minutes off and on and still have some battery life. Great drone especially for the price and after a few runs I will pick up a Holy Stone foldable.

The auto take-off and auto land features are very helpful for a novice pilot. I have not flown it in very windy conditions and don't intend to, but it handles light windy days with no problem, maintaining it's position in hover. the battery is removable and is held in it's recess in the drone very securely, with no change of accidently coming out. the drone does not have object avoidance, so the pilot has to be careful of flying too close to branches, buildings, etc. This feature though is only offered on drones of much higher cost and is not important if the pilot avoids flying in areas that are too small for a drone that is this size.  It is also fairly tough and resilient to damage in minor accidents. Spare propellers and guards are provided, as well as spare landing gear. Other parts are readily available from the manufacturer. the manufacturer is very responsive to customer questions and provides quick service (from China) if extra parts are needed.

I will say the prop locks can be a pain with the little screws, and make sure you insert them in the side that has the indention for the screw head or the covers will not fit on.  Also make sure you do the calibration correctly or it will not fly-hard to see the lights outside during the bright sunshine, so may want to calibrate early AM or late PM.

I could not believe how easy and stable this Holystone HS 100 drone is to operate. My neighbors son came over to watch and when you impress a 12 year old you know you have something great! Another item I have to mention is the customer service is outstanding. I recently purchased a new Samsung S20 and began having connectivity issues with my drone. I reached out to Holystone's customer service for help and they walked me through trouble shooting my new phone to get me up and flying again.

1315,3.0,"It's decent, but has some issues.","PROS:<br />-Easy to learn to fly.<br />-Good interface with the controller and phone app; phone held in place with a clip that should fit any phone, with or without a case.<br />-Very stable as long as it has a GPS signal. Will maintain its position even in wind.<br />-Good vertical & horizontal speed.<br />-Impressive max height, just below FAA limits.<br />-Easy to assemble with tools included, and some replacement parts.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-I've had issues with the camera, but the Holy Stone is going to replace it (details below).<br />-Camera mounting is not gyroscopic, so expect sudden dramatic movements any time you start or stop forward or lateral motion.<br />-Landing can be dicey. I'll get it over the spot where I want it to land, and hit the auto-land button, and it will often move around a bit before landing off the target. I once tried to land on a picnic table on a deck, but instead it flew off the edge of the deck, hit the side of the deck, and crashed in some plants.<br />-&#34;Follow me&#34; mode will not work. First time I tried, the drone just hovered in place, despite having good GPS signal in a wide-open field on a clear day. Second time I tried, it worked for a few seconds, but then started flying in circles that got wider and wider.<br />-On rare occasions, it will lurch forward or to the left immediately after takeoff, and be completely unstable and uncontrollable until I force it to land. I've broken landing gear twice because of this, and bent props. Manufacturer first said this is due to a gust of wind (it's not) and then said it's because I'm not controlling it right (it's not). It's because either the left 2 props or front 2 props aren't turning fast enough, and can only be fixed by shutting down and restarting.<br /><br />Holy Stone is willing to send a replacement camera, but not the whole drone. Here are the issues I had with the camera:<br />-Video is often poor quality, pixelated, and has interruptions.<br />-At least 1/3rd of the time, the video will freeze either immediately after hitting record, or at some point during flight. This results in flying blind, and a corrupted video file. It won't record again until I shut down the drone, the controller, and the app, and then restart all three.<br />-I can tilt the camera up & down manually, but NOT with the controller as intended.<br />-They had me troubleshoot the camera by formatting the SD card, and trying a different formatted SD card. Didn't work, so they'll replace it.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'd be on the fence about recommending it. I'm glad they agreed to replace the camera. But not replacing the drone might mean these issues are standard.<br /><br />Note: Review may be updated once I receive the camera, and if the issues keep happening.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFSA3HHRMIQYAVZYSRZQPYQITNUA,1539830225747,14,True

1321,5.0,super simple and idiot proof,"I have looked at drones for some time now and have not pulled the trigger because of cost for what I wanted. Then I found the Holy Stone HS100. What a great drone this turned out to be. This is my first drone and I couldn't be happier.<br />The set up was fairly simple and getting it in the air for the first time was flawless. I did make one call to customer support about the initial pairing, but they got me fixed up with no problems. I have flown about 5 times now to get myself used to the controls and it is amazing how quick it is to get used to. No crashes and it does everything I want.<br />The pictures are good for my purposes but I'm sure some people would want a 1080 camera. I understand the better camera drains the battery faster, so I will stick with the 720. I purchased the case from Holy Stone and it was top notch. It is the only one I found that did not require the removal of the propellers, which would be a real pain. Along with two extra batteries, I am set for a ton of fun.

Have only made our first couple of flights, but it's been easy to get started. Assembly was a snap, and my wife (who is not mechanically inclined) was able to fly the drone on her first try. Haven't done anything exotic yet, but  can already tell this is going to be pretty easy and a great way to see if she'll enjoy photography with a drone before moving on the more expensive models. We have had a couple crashes with trees and then also took advantage of the ""emergency landing"" feature. The HS100 bounced back nicely from the impacts. I did install the propeller guards - which I'd definitely recommend AT LEAST while we're still novice pilots. Initial thoughts are this is a good product for the price.

On the second time, before flying the drone, the app informed that the remote control was with no battery (but it was charged). After fully recharging the remote control the problem remained. After about 5 minutes insisting on trying to fly the drone (holy stone hs100) we made it because the app finally recognized the battery was full. Another thing: the material which the drone is made of is not the best quality. It could be a bit more resistant. The remote control looks like a cheap toy. But the drone is working well despite the battery recognition by the app.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I25fPPu-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I25fPPu-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I25fPPu-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PsbW4VE7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PsbW4VE7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PsbW4VE7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81whyS5rtlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81whyS5rtlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81whyS5rtlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AH7FC7MCKVQSOAMYHAJJPMBO46ZQ,1535069483883,0,True
1351,4.0,Great new toy. Awesome support.,This is a cool product. I have never had a drone before. It will take some practice flying as well as calibrating it each time that you use it. I feel that once I get more comfortable using it it will be simple to get going. It is cool to use though. I need to take it out to a field to really get it going. Also I wish it came apart easier for storage but since it is screwed together it will just sit taking up room while not in use. Pretty simple to get it going. I just have to have the instructions on hand in order to calibrate it and fly in the right direction. I will love it the more comfortable I get. Plus customer support is A+... I give the support 5 stars. They are very responsive! Best support experience I have ever had.,[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEV7NWABNCA2X72KAZKLMYAMGO5A,1528764238268,0,True
1352,5.0,Great drone at a great price!,"I just received the Holy Stone HS100 Drone as a gift. It's my first Drone and it's very easy to operate and has technology and functions that many other Drones have but at a much better price point. The GPS, auto land, auto take off, and return home are a great benefit that I can utilize until I get in more practice. Everything works as it's suppose to and having an extra battery or two will definitely make recharge time not as noticeable. The Holy Stone HS100 is definitely the right choice for not only a beginner but even skilled pilots and has most of the options either would want or require. My Nephew Definitely made the right choice by choosing the HS100 and I look forward to purchasing more Drones from Holy Stone in the future!<br />Gari B.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFVF5A36YV6EV4SDR5VRESJXSOEA,1524234239616,0,True

1354,5.0,Great Drone and Great Customer Service,"The Holy Stone HS100 (GPS) is a great drone packed with many features that make it fun and safe to fly. The included 720P camera can be rotated up and down while flying which allows for better photos, videos and FPV (First Person View). GPS enables one button Take-Off, Landing, Return to Home, Low-Battery Return to Home and Transmitter Disconnect Return to Home. All great features that should help prevent even beginners from losing this drone. GPS is a Must Have on any drone that will be flown outdoors.<br /><br />The HS GPS PRO phone app works well on my Android phone and displays live FPV from the camera. This app is packed with a lot of information pertaining to the drone, transmitter and flight details. Most all transmitter functions can be carried out through the phone app. You will see the battery status of the drone and transmitter. Also, the current speed, distance and altitude are all visible on-screen as you fly (the distance and altitude can be limited in the phone app and any one of three flying speeds can be selected on the transmitter). The phone app also logs flight information so you can look back at the max distance, speed and altitude pertaining to each of your flights. You can also view your pictures and videos in the “Gallery” of the phone app at any time after your flight. Explore this app, especially the “Learn” and “Help” buttons, before your first flight.<br /><br />The drone battery takes several hours to charge and provides a decent flight time of approximately 15 minutes. An additional battery is definitely recommended so you can enjoy more than one flight per outing.<br /><br />A few things learned along the way: Start your video recording from the phone app, not on the transmitter. This will prevent the constant beeping while recording. Also, go into the menu of the phone app and turn OFF “Beginner Mode” if you do not want to calibrate the compass every time you fly. However, any time you change location you should always calibrate the compass before you make your first flight.<br /><br />Holy Stone is an excellent company and has one of the best Customer Service Teams in the business. I did have to contact them for a question and for a problem with my drone. Alex replied to each of my emails within a few hours. He and I emailed back and forth several times as he worked with me on my problem. Alex determined the cause of the problem and arranged for a replacement. Alex was courteous the entire time and he was genuinely interested in resolving my problem so that I was happy with my purchase. The replacement flies great and flying the HS100 has become a new and exciting hobby for me. Holy Stone will go the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your purchase.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEXO2SKIPQV6JJGCCSWDEJNR66NQ,1522792266649,0,True

1393,5.0,Amazing Drone for a great price,I bought this drone for my son’s 12th birthday. He loves it! It is fairly easy to learn especially with the take off/landing feature and return home. I like that is has a beginner mode so it limits how high and far he can take it. The pictures and video the drone takes are the main reason we bought this and I am very impressed by it.

1394,4.0,"Fairly easy to use, durable","I haven't tried using the drone without a phone, since I like seeing what the drone's camera is seeing, but using it with one is pretty okay - it takes some time (a couple minutes) to create the direct Wi-Fi connection from the phone to the drone, and for the drone to get a GPS signal, but once it's ready to fly, it works well - the iOS app has a new user feature that limits the height and distance to 30 meters; with that mode disabled, you can still adjust the maximum height, up to the FAA-mandated maximum height of 120 m (400 feet), so you know you're still flying within the height rules (remember to register with the FAA; it's only $5 for 3 years.)<br /><br />Luckily, I decided to add the blade guards (kind of like training wheels for drones), so even thought I've dug into the ground while landing, flew into a tree (I think its battery was drained and was lowering itself down), and the outside of the garage (always maintain constant eye contact with your drone), the only damage is scrapes and garage paint on the blades and top of the drone.<br /><br />The only issue I have is my phone doesn't keep a good ad-hoc Wi-Fi connection to the camera (which appears to have its own antenna), especially when attempting to record video; this could either be due the camera's antenna, or my phone (iPhone 11 Pro with a silicone case, clipped into the phone holder in the remote control).",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGNP4XPHALNFY2MVFXQF2DXC43JA,1592183267326,0,False

I contacted Holy Stone via email and they responded immediately. They were sympathetic and asked that I email them photos of the damage. I did so and within a day they replied and said they would replace the drone and that my son could keep the damaged one for spare parts in the future! We can't wait for the weather to improve a bit so we can get outside and fly again.<br />In short, the drone is well made, easy to set up and maneuver and Holy Stone have some of the kindest and most accommodating customer service I have ever encountered.

Though I don't have much experience in drone flying, this one seems to be a good one to try out before investing serious money into something with more features. As a beginner, the controls have some getting used to. R/C cars is what I've played with before and this is a bit different, but with some practice it won't take too long to figure out. The remote feels a little cheep, but the drone itself had no issues getting into the air. A few times toward the end of the battery life of the drone, the motors seemed to run a little haywire. This could have been a delayed response from the remote though, I'm not sure. Be sure to follow the set up and sync instructions in the manual and you'll be flying in no time.<br />PROS: Easy to understand remote, simple assembly, detailed instructions, ""Beginners"" setting when first practicing<br />CONS: Short battery life (12-15minutes), Long charge time (2-3 hours), cheep/lightweight remote.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PHmLUQWUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PHmLUQWUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PHmLUQWUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91NHRzV2wLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91NHRzV2wLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91NHRzV2wLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91nA7Z72fWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91nA7Z72fWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91nA7Z72fWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHOUAPPLI6BDU3LFPUEFUXZGG2DQ,1606836789110,0,False

1436,4.0,Great beginner Drone,"This drone is a great drone for beginners who want a little more than just a toy.  I found the controller easy to use with some good features.  The ""Return to Home"" feature will bring your drone back to the starting place, but be careful as it will not avoid hazards.  Basically a straight line via GPS.  The camera gimble will move from 90 to 180 degrees (straight down), but it is a little slow, so give it time.  The photo quality is excellent.  I was able to get good shots of my house and roof (checking shingles).  The battery I found to be decent in time ~15 mins.  So once you get the hang of it, I recommend that you get multiple batteries.  I will be upgrading at some point, but this is a definite great drone to start with.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFQG44O3JB33WG4H7IXKAEBIILWA,1564531671185,0,True

Ya the flight time is only half that of the more expensive pro drones it was still fun watching him play around .

1462,5.0,Very Cool Tool,"[[VIDEOID:c56f5a2ec3469fb085cdba714ec22612]] I am a senior citizen who can no longer climb on roofs to check things like gutter leaks or leaks in the solar pool heater, so I bought the HS 100 to help me out. I am very impressed with the drone's performance, even in the hands of a drone rookie. Let's start with assembly... I found the assembly instructions easy to understand and all parts, including spare rotors and rotor protectors were present. I would suggest that when installing the rotors you start the screw in the hole in the rotor first, then line it up and tighten it. That avoids dropped and lost tiny screws. As far as flying it, I am COMPLETELY INEXPERIENCED but the instructions were clear enough to get me going. I was really impressed with the auto-takeoff feature. I pushed the button and it took off and hovered at five feet until I  gave gave it further commands. I also like the fact that when you push the joystick forward and then release it, the drone does not continue forward, but stops and hovers. I was afraid I would have to reverse direction to get it to stop. The auto-landing feature also worked well. I just flew it over my head to a point in front of me and pushed the ""land"" button and it settled to the ground. Another great feature is that the camera can be adjusted downward in flight so you don't have to point the drone downward to get roof photos. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I still have a lot to learn and need a lot more practice because it responds very quickly and is subject to unwanted direction changes if the wind kicks up. A video is worth a thousand words so have a look at my maiden voyage, which I have attached.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AG6FHVSEBF4LBS342Q2WWQLZXFMQ,1544627630532,1,True

I do have to configure it to a GPS every time I fly it, which I thought was only required in new locations, but it's not a big deal.

1475,5.0,"Powerful, stable, great range and very user friendly......","Finally had a chance to fly this drone after waiting for the weather to cooperate.  It was still a bit breezy today but I was getting anxious to fly so I went ahead and gave it a shot.  I was surprised how stable this thing was even in the windy conditions.  My first impression after one flight is that this is going to be everything I was hoping for in a bigger sized drone.  The range on this is amazing.  I was a little nervous to let it get too far away for my first flight with it, but I sent it pretty high and probably flew it a good 300' away from me and it handled just like it was next to me.  The WIFI stayed connected to my phone the whole time and I could see perfectly where I was flying.  At times I had a little lag on my phone screen, but that may be my phone because it acts up on some other apps as well.  Once I have a nice calm day I am going to take it out in a field and see just how far I can take this away from me and I'll give an update.  Assembly of the blades and guards was easy, downloading the app and connecting to my phone worked without any problems and I also love the fact that the charger cable for the controller and drone battery is the same as my phone so If I lose it or something happens to it I can just use my phone charger.  Another bonus is that the controller has a built in battery.  Configuring the drone for the first flight and sinking it with the controller was easy, just follow the directions in the book or the on screen directions in the app for your phone.  One cool feature of the app is that it has a flight log that tells you the date and time, how far you flew, what your speed was and your altitude.  I flew until I received a low battery warning on the drone and then all I did was push the return to home button and it flew back to me automatically and hovered above me until I pressed the automatic take off/land button and it landed itself pretty much within about a foot of where it took off from.  The only problem I had was getting the gimble dial to work for adjusting the camera tilt when flying.  It was working on the ground before I took off, so it may have been that I just wasn't seeing the adjustment on my phone screen or something.  I will try more of the functions next time I fly, like the follow me mode, headless mode, and maybe even fly with the no GPS mode.  I am extremely happy so far with this drone, and  I feel like I got a high end drone without having to break the bank.  I will give more updates as I have time to fly more.

Do yourself a favor and read the instructions first. I spent a few minutes trying to figure out why it wouldn't take off. It has a take-off / landing button on the remote - press the button and it takes off and hovers a few feet off the ground. Landings are automatic as well and very smooth. I'm impressed with how gentle the auto-landing is.<br /><br />Like all Holy Stone drones, they give you a lot of extra parts. Mine came with two sets of rotors and rotor guards, plus extra hardware for mounting everything.<br /><br />I found the iPhone app easy to use, but it doesn't always connect to the video feed. I've found that it works reliably if I keep the phone close to the drone until the video starts.<br /><br />Flying is very easy and the GPS hold works well. The return to home function also works quite well. I haven't tried the auto-follow function yet because there a lot of trees in my immediate area. With it set in Beginner mode my 8-year old was able to fly it around the park near our house. It's not suitable for children on their own, though.

1485,5.0,Nice Starter drone and great service,"Very nice drone to get started.  I like the fact that it has an on board SD card and is very sturdy. Being a heavier drone it did require registration with the FAA in the US. Here's a tip not apparent from the manual.  Once you turn on the drone and pair with the remote, connect your phone to the Drone's wifi before doing anything else.  Then launch the app.  You can then use the app to check the status of the drone while you are Calibrating the Compass and Gyro.  The manual doesn't mention connecting the app until after all the setup. One of the many things I liked was how fast the GPS locked on.  It was so fast that the app almost immediately went to ready to fly. I also found the beginner mode helpful in keeping me from getting ahead of myself.  Finally, I did have a small issue with the joysticks sticking on the remote.  Holy Stone was very responsive and sent me a replacement immediately.  I can say this was my main reason for buying this drone over some of the other brands. Their reputation for great service.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGNTBL7V7RN2C3MEL443HNVGFYDA,1610026170078,0,True

The drone is very smart and the GPS feature is incredible. It's really nice to know that if it loses connection to my controller that it will automatically return to where it took off. I lost another drone because it did not have that feature. The battery does take some time to charge but it will give you a good 10 to 15 minutes of flying time. I still have to figure out all the features but so far I really enjoyed using it. It's very intelligent and it senses if there's something blocking one of the rotors. I put the drone down on the ground and there was a long piece of grass that was in the area of the rotor. As a result, the rotor did not spin because it sensed that there was something that may be damaged if it did try to turn. Very smart and very safe.

So far, the controls are exactly like my previous model and the almost 90 degree remote camera adjusting is exactly what I need. It does handle a bit differently than the HS120, but that's due to it being over twice the weight. An FAA is required since its 700 grams.<br /><br />The only thing I have not found to be impressive is the flight time, which is advertised at 18 minutes however realistically it gets about 10. I ordered another battery, so I'll update when it arrives to compare.<br /><br />The camera quality isn't spectacular, but for the price and its ability to change the angle from the remote , I'd give it 5 stars. What's really cool which I never saw advertised was the little rubber bushings that the camera mount has- they act almost as suspension for the camera unit and appears to help resist damage if you hit the camera on anything.<br /><br />This unit does NOT come with a carry case, which is kinda bizarre to me.

1552,5.0,AWESOME DRONE,"[[VIDEOID:7ef3fe1e5d7e0a73f4f457a5cc55e295]] I started off with Holy stones F181W and it is a great drone, I have crashed it many times while learning and flying it hard. Customer service has been great, Libby has been a great help to figure things out. I now have the Hs100, this is such a nice drone. The first time I pushed the take off button I was impressed with the power of those big props. I have flown it many times even past it's transmission range. It was so nice that it just came back like a good dog and I didn't lose it. The flat black finish of the drone looks stealthy. The camera works great and is so nice that it pivots up and down so you can see things and not have to raise or lower the drone to view something below. I like the read out that shows your current height, distance away, battery level in the controller and most of all the battery level in the drone. Return to home works AWESOME, it lands within a couple feet of where you started. I would suggest that after you get used to it you adjust the limits on height and distance in the app. A nice feature is the return height so it doesn't return to you and fly right into an object or a tree, it will return to your spot at the pre-set altitude and drop right down to you. GPS is super stable, I can let go of the controls and it just waits for me wherever I stop it even in a good breeze.

1576,5.0,A Beast of a Drone!,"[[VIDEOID:34672533608912c73a70ab1273ed144e]] Yes I would recommend the HS100 for anyone looking for a higher quality drone.  (Scroll to bottom for quick list of pros and cons)<br /><br />This is only the second drone I have ever owned (the first one being a Holy Stone HS110) so I identify as a &quot;pilot in training&quot;.  Firstly, I can't speak highly enough of Holy Stone's customer service.  Never have I interacted with a company that is as friendly, quick to help and will go above and beyond to make their customers satisfied.  Seriously they are awesome.<br /><br />The HS100 is easy to fly and even has a &quot;Beginner mode&quot; that limits altitude, flight distance etc, to ensure it doesn't fly off out of your control.  It has other cool features like &quot;Follow Me&quot; where the drone actually follows your mobile phone's GPS signal and a &quot;Return Home&quot; function that has the drone fly back to where it took off with one click of a button.  The camera is much improved from the HS110 and I'm looking forward to getting nice aerial photos/videos.  You can even pivot the camera up and down to get the best angle.  I really appreciate the detachable battery that has indicator lights on it letting you know how much battery remains and easily slides in and out of the drone for quick swapping/charging.  The battery also lasts much longer with flight times of about 15 minutes (vs 4-8 min of the HS110).  The controller also has it's own rechargeable battery which is a nice improvement.<br /><br />My primary dislike is my smart phone not syncing with the companion app which is a big frustration since I can't see what the drone's camera sees.  I noticed another reviewer had this same complaint which was solved by rebooting the phone so I'll try that next time.  The drone is designed with the expectation of flying it in conjunction with a smart phone although it is flyable without requiring a phone.  Pretty much every time I want to fly it I have to configure the gyros and compass systems which involves holding the drone and spinning around in a circle which adds a couple of minutes of &quot;preflight time&quot;.  This is necessary due to the many complex features of the HS100 whereas the HS110 is more of a toy that is &quot;turn on and go&quot;.  The many features of the HS100 means there is a higher learning curve before I'll be comfortable knowing all its &quot;bells and whistles&quot;.  For instance the controller has 8 different LED indicators which will be great once I'm familiar with them but for now is a little overwhelming.  (Headless mode vs GPS mode vs Follow Me mode etc)  These are hardly negatives since it just makes me want to fly it more!  Also, my old drone can do trick flips which are pretty fun while this drone does not flip.  It makes up for it by being a supercharged beast that despite its size can really tear through the air.  Lastly, the propellers are packaged in a hidden compartment underneath the Styrofoam box!  I contacted customer service thinking I was missing them and she finally told me to look at the bottom of the packaging and there they were!  So make sure you have your propellers before you throw out the packaging!<br /><br />Despite my few complaints, I still feel this is a 5 star product and if you are looking for a high quality drone with a good camera, look no further.  This is a beast of a drone and I can't wait to learn how to utilize the many features it offers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Best Customer Service<br />*Easy to pilot, good choice for beginners<br />*Lots of cool features<br />*Good camera that can pivot up/down<br />*Detachable powerful battery giving 15min flight time<br />*Rechargeable controller<br />*Very sturdy and powerful drone<br />*Very sleek looking<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Companion app doesn't consistently sync with phone<br />*Doesn't perform trick flips<br />*Propellers hidden in bottom of packaging<br />*Too many features to learn! :-)","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NhU7yiAIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NhU7yiAIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NhU7yiAIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XF58BHyyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XF58BHyyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XF58BHyyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cHaCFDJoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cHaCFDJoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cHaCFDJoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Z3iW3wRQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Z3iW3wRQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Z3iW3wRQL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91yALrVPViL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91yALrVPViL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91yALrVPViL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEBLZ2T5TEENMAOYCBNFM6ZTQC5A,1512354113170,6,True

1592,4.0,"Joy stick controller says "" low battery"" the HS100 drone would not fly... How I fixed this problem.","Update: 8/4/2019  I originally gave my HS 100 drone a three star but now a 4 star.<br />1.  I have been in contact with at least six Holy Stone members.  (Zare was the very patient, and understanding and worked with me directly on my problem. )  All members of their team were concerned about my comments.  I thought my controller battery was bad because it always indicated low voltage.  I even took it apart and considered replacing the battery.  Holy Stone sent me a new HS100 and controller to replace the one I previously could not get to work.  I could not get the replacement to work either... the controller still indicated  ""low battery"".  Today I watched a short You Tube video about the controller and realized that the problem I was having was not with the controller at all nor the batteries in the controller... ""  Here is what I had been doing wrong...When I pair the controller to the drone I had always tilted the  joy stick to the 12 o'clock position as show in all the videos.  The message on my HS pro controller app always stated the battery was low.... hence I could not get the drone to fly.<br />Here was the fix... when you pair the drone to the controller,  slip the left hand joy stick to the 12 o'clock position and also down to the 6 o'clock position (this was stated in the instruction book).  At this point you will hear a beep, and the flashing yellow light on the joy stick controller will stop flashing.  You HS pro app on your I phone will now read … ready to fly.  I am sorry to have taken so long to figure all this out.  I read the book, three times, watched at least 8 hours of You Tube videos, and have probably 10 follow up letter from the courteous folks at Holy Stone.<br />I flew my HS 100 today and went through four (now six) different drone batteries each lasting about 10-12 minutes.  The joy stick controller never had to be recharged so there was never a problem with the controller battery as I had originally suspected.<br /><br />Also...Make sure you match the blades A-A and B-B.  I accidentally had one blade mismatched and every time it took off it nosed down into the grass.  This was an easy fix... I matched the correct the blade, took about two minutes.<br /><br />I hit a pine tree today and the drone crashed down about ten feet, the camera rolled around on the ground like the head had fallen off:)  I reconnected the camera and flew the drone … camera and drone worked perfectly.<br />My wife even took control of the HS 100 on one flight and flew it without ever have touched a controller before...it went well up until she flew the  drone out of site, behind a tree, at which time she handed the controller back and said "" you take over!""<br /><br />Still give it a four stars because the camera could be better, and it took awhile to work out the problem that ""I"" had with the pairing of the drone to the controller... a simple flip of the switch, up and then down... not just up.<br /><br />Would I recommend the HS100... sure lots of fun.  In noticed Holy Stone has an HS 700 out.  I will take a look at this one in the future.<br /><br />To all the staff at Holy Stone, where ever you are... Thanks for being so courteous and helpful.<br /><br />The HS100 was fun to fly.  I am a novice and did not know anything about flying drones.

1606,4.0,WATCH FOR TREEEEEEEEEEES!!!,"Anyone considering buying a GREAT drone for a beginner, should check this out. Holy Stone has been a great company to deal with so far and to me, that goes a long way. I ordered my drone one evening and received the drone the very next evening. I was shocked that they sent it so quickly! So for my first flight... I read the manual, followed the directions and after charging both the controller and the drone batteries, I was off! I live on 6 1/2 acres of wooded land with a couple of clearings. I started the drone and pressed the automatic takeoff button. It started flying, zipped off the ground and sat there about 6 feet off the ground. It held it's position beautifully! I took control and started flying around and having a great time. Then I zigged when I should have zagged. Lol! I got the drone stuck at the top of a 60' pine tree on the VERY first flight!!<br /><br />Long story short... With an extension ladder, a pole saw and a very nervous 30 year old nephew, the drone came out of the tree. All the way to the ground. THUD! I just knew it had to be damaged. I ran over and everything was intact and flawless! So I took it to the center of the clearing and baby stepped the controller. It flew AMAZING and the whole family enjoyed watching it fly around effortlessly. The camera rotates up and down if you want to change the camera angle and it looks really good. No, it isn't a 4K image, or even a 1080p image. I could have spent a few more bucks and got a Parrot Bebop 2 but I wanted a drone with great customer service and one that was easy to fly for a beginner. I got both in this drone and it does exactly as it promises. And it came with a lot of spare parts. Propellers, landing gears, extra screws, washers, etc.. The controller works great and the instruction manual is pretty top notch as well.<br /><br />My only downside to this drone which kept me from giving it 5 stars is the battery. It takes 3-4 hours at least to charge it and you only get 10-15 minutes of flight time. They do send you an extra battery for free though, so thats good. But that charge time... ehhh.....

It flies well and was easy to use.  As a beginner drone, I would have highly recommend it.  However, we just took it out again and now the remote control battery won't charge.  First, I charged it for an hour, then 4 hours, then 24 hours with no result.  I called customer service who told me it was my fault the remote was no longer working because I charged it for greater than 3-6 hours???  They told me I had to buy a new battery and directed me to their website.  We both looked while I was on the phone and could not find the replacement battery for the HS 100.  I was told it must be out of stock.  They took my info and will get back to me.<br /><br />This seems to be an awfully short lifespan for a remote control battery.  The battery for the drone appears to be working fine.  I'm hoping to get better results from customer service and will amend this review accordingly.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was almost immediately contacted following the original review (by email) with instructions to correct my issue.  This did not involve replacing the battery.  It's not clear why the original call didn't give me the same info.<br /><br />Regardless, as I mentioned above, the drone itself works well, flies well, and hovers well. The beginners mode allows my son to fly it without fear getting too far.  He did fly it into a tree however and it fell a good 30 feet to the ground.

1624,5.0,It is a great beginner intro unit,"UPDATED REVIEW<br />After posting my review, Holy Stone reached out with me to verify the exact details.  After a brief discussion, they took matters above customer service and replaced the item, as opposed to discrediting my input. The 5 stars relate to this, and also the overall experience with the drone.  It is almost “stupid-proof”, almost.  (You can’t fix stupid).<br /><br />Regardless, thank you for the wonderful experience and attention to our unfortunate initial experience.<br /><br />I would give a 5 star, but only if it didnt fall out of the sky.  It says it will return if the battery goes low (automatically), but it dropped onto the concrete and more drone.<br /><br />Prior to that, It is a great beginner intro unit. It will exceed expectations, but watch the battery and use the landing feature to avoid needless hard landings.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l8tLn2hFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l8tLn2hFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l8tLn2hFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGHZKJRRTOUJ3MNWELDOOL5W45GA,1525232062215,0,False

1637,5.0,My First Large drone - Quite Amazing,I've have this little drone that is so small you could put it in your shirt pocket. I would play with my cat with it. It was just a toy and completely terrible controlling it. It had a mind of it's own.<br />Now I have just flew the HS100 for the first time today and it was perfect. Very easy to control and fun to fly. No crashes either. Took it up to about 100 feet. On board camera is very nice providing execellent videos and pictures in HD. WiFi connection with my phone was easily done. Over all I'm very happy with it. Certainly measures up to those thousand dollar drones.<br />I think the only thing that could use a tune up is the software as it keeps reporting at the beginning that your controller battery is low. But simply moving the left control stick up and down acouple time seems to fix it while the drone is sitting on the ground not sure why. I'm going to need an additional battery because I love flying this drone.

1642,4.0,Detailed Review from a New Drone Flyer - Feature Rich at a Good Value Price - BUT with a really lousy camera,"This is going to be a bit of a detailed review. For those who want to get right to the point, this is a feature-rich, well constructed drone that is excellent for beginners and experienced flyers alike. Now for a bit more detail.<br /><br />To start, I am a novice drone flyer but I have a lot of friends that have been flying drones for years. I've heard stories of drones flying away never to be seen again so I was looking for a drone that was beginner friendly but that was feature rich enough that as I get better as a flyer, my drone can continue to grow with me and in six months, I'm not looking to upgrade. Likewise, I didn't want to break the bank. I wasn't even sure how much I was going to like flying drones (a LOT) and in case I crashed or lost the drone, didn't want to be out a lot of cash. I received a lot of recommendations to get a DJI but didn't want to spend that kind of money. Looking at the feature set, camera and flight time of the HS100, I thought it was a very good value for the price. Lastly, my main reason for getting a drone was to take aerial photographs and video for construction planning and real estate marketing.<br /><br />The components were well organized in the box and securely packaged. From first glance, you could tell this was probably a well thought out product. I was surprised and very happy to see that that HS100 comes with a replacement set of rotor blades and landing gear. I've flown RC planes before and as I've mentioned, heard plenty of drone crash stories so I know that at some point, these spares are going to come in handy.<br /><br />Assembly is a quick and easy and Holy Stone provides two small screwdrivers that are the only needed tools. That was another nice touch since some of the screws are very small and you would need an eyeglass screwdriver to install them. So far so good. I liked the build quality and look of the drone. Drones are a cool thing and they should look cool :) and this one does. The remote control is very lightweight which is nice so you aren't lugging around a clunky remote while you are flying. The physical integration of the remote with my iPhone was seamless.<br /><br />Next I tried to setup the drone for the first time and had difficulty because the pre flight instructions are not very clear. At least they weren't to me. This is the only knock on this drone so far and I would have given it a 4-star rating but I called Holystone's tech support and to my total surprise - someone answered the phone. They emailed me a link to a brief YouTube video showing a preflight tutorial that was easy to use and had me flying in minutes. Nice job guys. I'd still like to have more documentation on things like: Can you fly the drone without a cell phone connected and if so, how? Can you take off and land manually (not in the auto mode)?<br /><br />Flying was a total blast. As previously mentioned, this is my first drone so I don't have any comparison but I've flown remote controlled airplanes before and this is MUCH easier. Auto take off and landing is a fantastic feature for beginners - it's going to save a lot of broken parts - and it makes flying the drone easy. All the controls are well placed on the console and the drone is very stable in flight. Take your hands off the controls and it essentially hovers in place. The stabilization is very effective and I had the drone zipping around in front of my house in minutes. The controls to me have just the right amount of sensitivity - the drone is very nimble but if you press one of the joysticks all the way down, the drone doesn't just go flying off out of control. I live on the beach and it was a windy day so I started in the lee of the house and kept the HS100 close to the ground. I wanted to make sure the wind wasn't going to take the drone or cause a crash. Then I flew it up into the wind above the top of the roof of my house and I was surprised to see how well it handled in the wind. One tip: don't try and take pictures or especially video on a windy day. As stabilized as the drone is, it still bounced around in the wind and you end up with off axis images and really jerky video.<br /><br />As with all drones, flight time isn't as long as I would want it to be. I didn't time my flights but it seemed like that batteries lasted 10-15 minutes. I ordered this with a spare battery and would highly recommend you do too. In fact, a couple of spares would be a good thing because the last thing you want it to get into flying and then have to quit right as you're starting to have fun. The batteries take a while to charge (a couple of hours).<br /><br />I've just started using the camera and video features and as noted, they don't work well in a lot of wind. I'm waiting for a calm morning and then will fly up high and shoot some footage and stills.  I tried playing with the camera pan feature but don't think I've been able to get it to work yet. As I do more flying - higher altitude and longer distance, and take more imagery and video. I'll update this review.<br /><br />As of now, I'm very happy with this drone and think it provided the right set of features for me - a beginner that wants to be able to grow into more advanced flying. And the price was right.<br /><br />First Update: I've been flying the drone for a week now and can definitively say it's great for a beginner. In GPS mode, with the auto takeoff and landing, it's fairly hard to crash. In addition, when in this mode and you take your hands off the controls, the drone comes to a hover in place. So if things are getting out of control, all you need to do is let go of the controls and the drone will come to a stop and hover. Then you could even hit the autoland button if you needed.  It is very stable and relatively easy to fly and I was surprised at how well it did in windy conditions. The four engines produce enough force to allow the drone to fly into a stiff breeze and keep it steady in hover even when windy. I live on the beach and it's windy here a lot. Yet, it's highly maneuverable. Again, I don't have a lot of other drones to reference but this is fun to fly and can zip around. I disabled the beginner mode so I could take it higher and farther out and had no issues.  I like the look of the drone and so far it's been sturdy. I've only had two harder landings with no damage or issues. If you really want to enjoy this drone, you need at least one additional battery (2 total) or two would be better (3 total). It takes a couple hours to charge batteries and with only a single battery, you're done in 15 minutes or less.<br /><br />I've tried the non GPS mode which requires a lot more attention to flying but is still pretty stable. In addition, I used follow mode which worked great and the drone followed me as I rolled down the street on my beach cruiser. I would doubt that this drone could keep up with me down a trail on my mountain bike but if you are out jogging or walking, it will do the job. More to come as I get into the photo and video.<br /><br />Photos and Video: One of the main reasons I purchased this drone was to take aerial photography. If you want more detail, read on but in short the camera on this drone is really awful.  720p sounds great and the Holystone website doesn't give more detail other than it's &#34;epic&#34; but I would really say epically bad. For background, I've worked as a professional photographer and wanted to use the drone to shoot aerials of real estate. When I first looked at the captured images, I thought I had done something wrong. They were incredibly grainy and and lacked detail. I hadn't seen anything like that in a digital image in years which isn't surprising. Then I did more research. For comparison, the camera in this drone is under one megapixel and a current iPhone is 12MP. The original iPhone in 2007 was 3MP.  There are other things that go into image quality than just the resolution of the sensor including lens size and quality and processing engine and both are weak on the HS100. Images lack good contrast, saturated colors and it has a problem with even reasonably high dynamic ranges. Add that all together and you get some lousy images. I'm very disappointed in the poor performance of the camera especially given that it was one of my primary needs in a drone. My fault for not doing more hard research up front but the website purports the imagery to be hi-def and epic and I thought epic would be good enough.<br /><br />With that said, I'm dropping my review to Four Stars. This is still a very feature rich drone that is friendly for beginners and more advanced drone fliers. It is really fun to fly. Just don't get it if you are looking to do a lot of photography or videography.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AE6TO5YQAL6SWTXFVDIKYPRKTJNA,1522268208549,16,True

On the other hand, the battery runs out a bit too fast for my liking,and takes a long time to charge as well. I do not like how the drone is a WiFi network on the iphone 6s, instead of just being a bluetooth accessory. That made it hard for me to set up the drone at locations other than my house. The controller has a mount that attaches to your phone, but the back of my phone case is too large to fit into the mount.

1706,5.0,STURDY & FUN,"STURDY & FUN!!  I originally bought this drone to use as one that I could learn to fly manually.  I recently bought two Phantom 4 Pro drones, but I need to be able to fly manually before I put those in the air.  I didn't have very high expectations for the Holy Stone because the price is low, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The machine takes off easily, and the GPS keeps it in place quite well.  It was pretty breezy when I launched this little jewel for the first time.  I have to say that it has very good manners.  It is easy to control and it's predictable.  Of course the most important flying characteristic of any drone is the FUN FACTOR.  Again, this machine surprised me.  It's actually a blast to fly!  I didn't time my flights, but I think that I got somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 minutes, and as I said, it was pretty breezy.  I bought a couple of extra batteries.  You'll want to as well because they do take a while to charge.  My &#34;smart&#34; phone display is not that bright, so I mostly left it in my pocket and flew by keeping the drone in my sight.  That's another practice point, since I'm going for my Part 107.  The &#34;follow me&#34; works pretty well.  The camera is not stabilized, but the video wasn't bad.  The thing that impressed me the most is that this thing is STURDY.  Being brand new to flying quads, I crashed the Holy Stone into bushes, trees, and the side of a shed several times.  Not a single thing ever broke.  Each time, I picked it up, reset the compass, and took right off again.  For some reason, I needed to reset the compass several times.  That was really the only annoyance, and it was a minor one.  It sounds like a weed eater when it's going into a bush, but the props are flexible enough to take a pounding without serious damage.  After the beating that this thing took from my first flights, it still looks good, with only minor scuffs.  The build quality is pretty darned good.  It was easy to assemble and the instructions are decent.  The props do have to be screwed on, and you'll need to avoid the coffee before you do it, as you'll need steady hands.  If you are looking for a fun drone that flies well and makes an awesome trainer for more advanced machines, this is the one.  If you are a good flyer already and want a fun little &#34;grab it quick&#34; drone or one that you can start your kid on, then this is the one.

Right out of the box you can tell the drone body is a high quality flexible plastic that will allow it to survive some hits. Setup is simple, but necessary. Besides decreasing the size of the box it serves as a guide to teach you how to replace the propellers and propeller guards which is just a fact of life with any drones. It's easy and all tools and parts are included along with spare landing gear, propellers and crash guards. The product page doesn't mention it, but the camera is on a motorized gimbal that you can adjust in flight. The product page says you can adjust it 90 degrees, but I really wasn't sure if it was something you adjust before you fly. I was pleased to see you can move it in flight from the controller. Overall this is a great beginner drone that you would not be quick to replace even as you advance in skill. There are not really any features you would miss. The GPS is a great feature for keeping your drone where you want it, but you can turn it off and they offer a Trim mode which allows you to balance the drone in flight to keep it from drifting in any direction.<br />The drone itself is powerful but easy to fly. It defaults to a beginner mode that limits you to height and distance, but you can easily turn it off in the phone app once you feel comfortable. Headless mode makes the drone fly in relation to you, turn that off and it flies in the direction the drone is facing, it's the difference between flying through looking at the video screen or looking at your drone to fly it. One way might make more sense to others, but I think Headless might be the easiest to understand - you want the drone to back away from you you push forward or up on the stick, if you want it to come back to you then you pull back. Without headless mode pushing forward or up on the stick and it will fly whichever way the drone is facing.<br />Calibrating the drone is quick and easy. It involves rotating the drone in 360 degrees in the horizontal and vertical, and the bright flight LED's let you know if you were successful. It takes seconds really once you know what to do. From the controller itself you can adjust the speed of the drone with a dial as well as another dial to adjust the tilt of the 120 degree view 720 HD camera. Video can be viewed in the app and also recorded and saved to the included micro SD card. You also get a card reader that allows you to easily transfer video to your computer.

1790,1.0,"Replacement parts should be the same or better than the original, not lower quality","Well here is my update.... got everything set up, drone took off and landed and flew for about 3 minutes when it stopped because the controller was dead. Charged the controller again and it lasts about 1 minutes now before it dies. Called customer service and they keep disconnecting my call after about 5 minutes on hold. Waiting to hear back on answer from email on what the process is for returning the drone. Which is a shame because most if the reviews were so good.<br /><br />I'm starting with 3 stars because I haven't been able to fly it yet. So I'll update when I do. It arrived with a bad battery (wouldn't charge) so I called and emailed customer service and after several days of back and forth was able to convince them the battery was no good. So they finally sent me a new battery and I got it today. It is not the same battery it came with. The original, as advertised battery was a 7.4v 3500mAh, the one they sent me is only 2500mAh which means the flying time will be shorter by about 5 to 7 minutes. Which is a lot when you are talking about 18 minutes of use per battery, but at least it will charge. I'll give it a few tests flights and update if needed. I wish they would have sent me a replacement battery that was the same as advertised. I would contact them again, but I don't want to wait another 2 weeks before I can fly the drone.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEEN7JVHHUU6Q3SCC37CFMVXUZTQ,1588267845095,6,True

But once again, with the outstanding customer support they are known for, I have accepted the HS100 a big step up for them, with a legit entry into this market. I have seen some reviews posted by others and will not cover it all, from un-boxing to first flight. I am familiar with other GPS drones for a reference point. First and foremost, Fly Safe! Open area! Un-populated, especially with this one, she can be a bit finicky.  Maintain visual contact and never rely totally on GPS. This goes for all Drones. What I like About it? The stow away phone holder, fits my Galaxy S8 with Otterbox! RTH feature has worked every time flawlessly. The weight adds considerable stability in windy conditions. Being able to adjust camera angle in flight is huge step for HS. Follow me mode works close range well, just keep her close for remote range. The variable speed is great. I was pleasantly surprised by how fast and nimble she is. The rechargeable Li-ion remote holds charge very well. The option for GPS or not is great for &#34;seat of the pants&#34; flying. Photo's and Video's are stable and clear. Line up your shot b4 you hit record. The amount of information on app and controller is just the right amount for situational awareness. I strongly suggest that b4 each flight you at least do the gyro calibration! She responds much better. Gyro and compass Calibrations every time you relocate and fly. I do both every-time/every-flight. It only takes a second. Make a Pre-Flight checklist. I don't use Headless Mode so cannot comment on that. The Trim W/O GPS, once you learn it, works very well. Nice touch. In a Nut Shell, HS has stepped up their game! This is a sophisticated Drone and that takes patience and learning her before you go all out flying her. Watch the tutorials, read the Manual. Customer support is OUTSTANDING and will answer any question. If you are not used to this much info she gives you at once, TAKE IT SLOW AND EASY.  If you do, This Quad-copter will serve you well and keep your investment safe as you learn more and more. One issue I have is the battery charge time. It has a good flight time, but it just takes, to me, an excessive time to charge. I recommend two batteries for this reason.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Nr2WyCSyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Nr2WyCSyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Nr2WyCSyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91P4f1ksFoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91P4f1ksFoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91P4f1ksFoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AEWHIJJ77DLDD6D4F7XCFWB36VZA,1513734126650,27,True

1823,4.0,The automatic takeoff and landing works great except if you hold the button more than 2 ...,Received the unit as a birthday present on time. I do have some experience in flying drones but there is some things that this unit does not live up to in the price range. The camera is only a 720p so the pictures do not live up to the expectations at this price point. Additionally the flight time is only around 12 minutes and then takes 3-6 hours to recharge and that's a lot of down time for a unit of this caliber. The price of an additional battery is around $40:00 which pushes this unit well over the $300 dollar level. The automatic takeoff and landing works great except if you hold the button more than 2 seconds (beginners panic when the unit did not immediately respond to emergency landing) the unit goes into &#34;emergency stop&#34; and falls from whatever altitude it is at. Compass calibration looks like it has to be done every time the battery is changed. .

You get a great quality drone for a great price not to mention my experience with the customer service had been great! I will buy from Holy Stone again when I am ready to upgrade this one.

1836,4.0,Nice stable drone,"[[VIDEOID:8f8b4851a840f5a5bd61b4dc038b19a5]] I own the Holy Stone F181 Chaser and the Holy Stone HS 110 W toy class drones. The HOLY STONE HS 100 (GPS) is a major upgrade in the Holy Stone toy class fleet. This drone is much larger than the other two.<br />Unofficially, on my kitchen scale, this unit weighs in at about 1.5 pounds, without prop guards, compared to 4 to 5 ounces for the other two, making this a much more stable unit. The HS 100 has GPS capability added. This feature eliminates the issue of the drone drifting away in windy conditions and allows the drone to hold steady with regard to altitude and distance from the controller. This allows the pilot to concentrate more on taking photographs than on trying to control drone flight.<br />The camera is motorized and can be moved up and down. This action is controlled from the transmitter. The 720P HD WIFI camera takes clear still and video pictures. The camera, though, does not have a gimbal. As a result, with the GPS feature continuously adjusting the drones’ position the fixed position camera mount makes for a lot of movement on videos.<br />This drone has a much bigger battery (15 mins flight time) and larger motors. This drone can fly to the 400’ U.S. altitude legal limit and 500 meter distance from the controller.  At these distances, it is impossible to fly the drone by visual observation. You can’t see it let alone tell which direction it’s going. You need to fly here using the viewer screen on your smart phone. This is where a good WIFI connection (which this drone has) and the return to home features are critical. When you are at these extreme distances, all that needs to be done is to press the return to home button. The drone will fly back to its take off point and automatically land itself. The same thing occurs if the drone loses contact with the controller or starts running out of power. The risk of loss is greatly reduced here. I would recommend this drone to a friend.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AHNTLHBOVLHJJ2ORRGKQIURKPANQ,1513008356307,124,True
1837,5.0,Learning Curve but worth it,"First, we've only had for a week so the curve isn't steep.  The instruction manual was probably translated so you have to read between the lines in a few spots or try a couple different methods.  The video was also helpful but the manual was better for us when calibrating.  Our &lt;13 year old could use it.  She games.  The beginning mode and return features were perfect since we didn't have to worry about losing it or it diving to the ground from such a great height.  We quickly learned you need to be sure when you hit the return button that the drone has an unimpeded straight line between where it is located and where it first took off.  As an aside (and certainly nothing to do with the product rating), we also had a little bit of a learning curve in relation to where we could fly the drone.  We were visiting family and our family did not think they lived within 5 miles of an airport.  When we arrived we used the recommended B4uFly app and found out we were too close to a local airport.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGN3CLOGJ6JIVRVSSF37F7ZBIQQA,1556463412030,0,True

They have a great community on their Facebook page for assisting fliers, especially first time flyers. The flight time is about 12 to 15 minutes and the drone weighs 672.8 grams (1.48 pounds) without the prop guards. You do need to register this drone with the FAA if flying in the United States. While the instructions may be a little confusing, there are videos available on the Holy Stone Website and tech support to work thru anything you might not understand. I've enclosed a video taken by the HS100 and a Pix from it so you can see the quality of the 720P camera.<br /><br />The one key takeoff and landing functions work well. It also has some great emergency features Return to Home on low battery, Loss of signal, or by pressing the Smart RTH button on the remote. Keep in mind though, this drone has no obstacle avoidance ability! So fly it in an open area free of trees, powerlines, etc. The Follow me functions also works well and tracks on the GPS signal on the  remote. The same caution about this function also - no obstacle avoidance!<br /><br />While, it would be great to have brushless motors, higher quality camera, and more features, this new drone by Holy Stone is an awesome picture platform at a great price especially when you keep in mind their customer service.

1904,5.0,The camera seems like it is built weak in comparison to the rest ...,"UPDATE: 7/17/2018<br />I have been extremely critical of this drone over time and with the upgraded camera along with a lower price, I believe it is worthy of a 5-star review. The customer service Holy Stone provides to the customers is nearly unmatched, and rivals Bose (known for their customer service). My statement still stands in terms of the camera, it seems weak in the build compared to the rest of the drone which is built fairly tough. Luckily, Holy Stone is fairly new to the mid-range market and I have hopes their next model that comes out will be a game changer for them and rival the likes of DJI. Overall, the flight is smooth and stable then when coupled with the App it is a fairly simple process to get your newly purchased drone in the air. I already own the DJI Spark, Ryze Tello, and HS190 from Holy Stone. I have a decent amount of experience with drones now, and on my DJI Spark I have 40hrs or so of flight time. This Holy Stone drone is a great addition to my growing collection and gives me a little more confidence when flying due to its strong build. I really wish Holy Stone would have had developed a gimbal for the camera as to create a more stable image. Luckily, you can work around that by flying smoothly when trying to capture the video shots you want and I highly suggest upgrading the camera to the new 1080p. Holy Stone has continued to listen to their customers and make improvements and over time I think they will be a competitor in the more expensive market once they establish a solid camera foundation. A huge deal to me is customer service, and Holy Stone nails it. You can rest assured that any issues you have, they will do everything in their power to make it right. They have DJI beat outright when it comes to their service and loyalty to their customers. If you want to test the waters of a larger drone and step up a little from the smaller drones I highly suggest you start with this one.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AF4APEZVA3GDZAHBKC7XWL5LMOMA,1521075685663,5,True

1910,4.0,Great Beginner Drone,This was one of my first legitiment “big” drones.  The  HS100 is 20” x  20” with the propeller guards installed and sits 7” tall.  It’s definitely not one of fastest drones out there – but its quick enough to keep you from getting boards.  It uses a blue / white light combo – although I prefer the red / green setup – the lights are very easy to see from the ground.  The drone flies nice and smooth; and the layout of the updated HS GPS Pro app is great.  The flight time could be better – but once again – this is a bit of a bigger drone.  I did have some issues with my camera tilt – but Holy Stone immediately sent a replacement camera which just snaps right in.  The drone does offer a limiting “beginner” mode which is controllable from the app which is great for letting the kids take over – or if you just don’t trust yourself.  You set your “safety” distances and if the drone distance or height exceeds that set – it pauses for a second and then returns to that distance set.  The controller is bit bulky and limited to just light up icons for status – but the buttons are laid out well and easy to manipulate.  There are definitely nicer drones out there  - but for the price to fun ratio – this one is right in the mark.,[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AG2HRHYQ7ZGTCQVRWBUP36UMXBYA,1571367865661,0,True

After reading a lot of reviews and research finally I came to choose this Holystone HS100. I ordered it and it arrived promptly. I have been playing around with it and I love it. After some minor assembly, I downloaded the app on my smart phone and turned on the camera indoor. It is amazing to see great photos and videos right on my phone screen. This machine is great.

I really love the Follow-Me Mode too!  it works very well at the beach on a calm day!  And the phone app and built in holder on the remote are very good features.  I would recommend including a nice adjustable neck strap in the box since that is always something I add to my remotes.<br /><br />I would recommend this drone to anyone from beginner to frustrated users like myself who need the drone to be a little smarter than I am.

1928,5.0,Excellent value,"Found Holy Stone offering 20% off for a few days before and after Thanksgiving. Read many reviews for HS 100 and was happy to see most were good or better.  Ordered through Amazon and chose Free (5-7 business days) shipping.  Received my drone 2 days later (WOW and thanks to Holy Stone).<br /><br />Build quality is very good.  Body is smooth, gaps are nearly invisible and all markings are either molded in or painted.  No decals.  Very nice.  I've only had 3 flight sessions so far, but all seems to work as it should.  Auto take off is great.  Drone rises 3-4 feet and holds Altitude and location.  Then I took over and, well, played a bit.  Auto land is even better.  As I played, more than once I let the drone wander outside my comfort zone.  Auto land stopped it dead in it's tracks, then safely landed it.  I've tried Return Home a few times.  Pretty sure I wasn't far enough away to make it work properly.  More sessions to come.<br /><br />I haven't used the camera at all.  I have noticed that a live image is displayed on my phone even before take off and it looks good.  It should be interesting to use it once I can fly a bit better.<br /><br />The only down side is the screws that secure the propeller retaining collar are really small.<br /><br />So far, all I can say is that the reviews I read before the purchase were accurate.  The drone operates as advertised.  I am pleased (except for the screws).",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGSLBU6V55NNDX77DTKFYQXJI6IA,1543234930791,1,True

1959,5.0,Great Budget Drone-Camera amd Battery Could be Better,"A pretty-well shared view of this drone is that it is a great drone. I hold this view completely. I have in addition to this drone a HS 220, which I found to be lacking in stabilization. This drone more than makes up for that problem. Its stable and its EXTREMELY powerful, it lifts into the air almost effortlessly. I love the versatility of the drone with the tilting camera and other features. A great pro to this drone is that I can actually rely on it to see something from the air without constant worry that it will simply be carried off. While one still must be carful and watchful of the drone, one can fly it with more assurance than with some of the smaller, lighter machines. All in all I only have two main complaints. One the camera is only 720p. I think it could stand to be at least 1080p, or maybe even a newer vairiant of the HS 100 with said camera, even though the price would be increased (although I hope only slighty increased since this is not a large upgrade). Next would be the battery life. Although I’ve never timed it and ot may very well live up to the 12-15 minute battery life as stated by Holy Stone, it seems rather short to me and I would like a long flight time (especially for the lengthy time required to fully charge the battery). In spite of these issues, I would fully 100% reccomend the drone and, from what I’ve experienced so far, Holy Stone as a drone company in general. The customer service is great, the extras that come with the drone (i.e. notebook and extra parts)bare great, and of courese the drone is fantastic.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AGHNYUFMVXPPLXC5WL625BHE2M4A,1526525894575,0,False

1972,5.0,Awesome!,"I got this for my bf for Christmas and he loves it. I did quite a bit of research and really glad I got this one. I’ll let him write the rest of this review since he’s the one who has used it.<br /><br />If I’d have bought a drone for myself, it would have been this one. It’s loaded with features and capabilities at a much more affordable price than similar drones. So, this one will work for me as a beginner, but also when I get experienced and want all the extra capabilities. If you buy this, here’s one tip. When you pull the parts out of the handy reusable case, flip the case over to find the propellers in a compartment on the bottom. At first, I couldn’t find them.<br /><br />I got this assembled in minutes. I was impressed that it comes with extra propellers, propeller guards and landing gear. This thing looks really cool. The instructions are clear and simple. I downloaded the free app and had this thing synched and ready to fly in no time. Like more expensive drones, you can trim the controls if they are not well-tuned, but mine came already well trimmed.<br /><br />Flying is easy. There is a button to automatically take-off and land, or you can do that manually. There is also return to home button - one push and it automatically flies back to where it started and lands itself. The controls have a good feel and sensitivity level. I haven’t tried the follow me function, but that should be fun and useful. The alititude hold is great for taking steady pictures and video. Speaking of that, the pic and video resolution is excellent. Another important thing - many drones have hard to see lights to tell which way it is facing. This one has very large lights marking the front and back. I could see them clearly from over 100’ away.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a full-featured drone at a great price, get this one. She also got me an extra battery - you’ll want to get one.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AFZMWUKPBJ5QD3MIAKKIQZGAHQWQ,1516974884880,0,False

It flies straight to the spot above where it took off from. I push the land button, and it lands within a few feet of where it started. That's the experience I was hoping for.

With too much confidence, I tried flying in the neighborhood. Bad mistake, Flew into a tree and when it came down the legs were broken and the camera had come disconnected. After a week, I put it together and tested. The camera and controls still works. Then I realized I have extra legs in the box.

The only problem I had was with my cell not connecting and a simple reboot of my phone fixed that. I love the fact that the drone will hover wherever I stop, this makes it easier to snap pic's or a video. The camera quality is great. All images are clear. Even during flight of the drone videos and pic's are perfect.  Also the beginner mode makes flying it easy. Having set points so it doesn't fly off out of control, helps me feel safe I wont crash it. My friend has a Best Buy drone where he spent double the price and this one the HS100 is by far superior. The best out of everything is the support you get from Holy Stone.

In my opinion, this is a great intro into drones, especially if you are as interested in photography as flying.  I started in beginner mode, which limits the performance of the drone.  This was great for me to learn the basics of flight.  Within a few minutes, I was flying like a pro.  Once I removed the beginner mode, I was able to start exploring the capabilities of the drone.  The speed is good, especially in sport mode.  I was surprised at how far and high I could fly and maintain a connection over the wireless network.  The camera is solid and the ability to change the angle in flight was one of the key reasons that I selected this drone.  Because the camera is not mounted on a gimble, the video can be a little shaky at times - but that is one of the reasons why this drone is more affordable than some from DJI. You can minimize the shakiness of the video by slowing your movements when flying, especially when you come to a stop.  The smoother the flight, the smoother the video. All in all, I am very happy with the performance of the drone and camera system.  I think it is a very good choice for beginner and intermediate drone enthusiasts.

2021,4.0,Caution with RTH Mode,"After spending some time with my first drone, Syma X5C, I upgraded to the HS100. As for control, the transition was startling and disabled the beginner mode after just two flights. I chalk it up to flying a basic drone that gave me no sense of overconfidence and provided good basic skills. Its was like learning to drive with a standard transmission before driving an automatic. As for the HS100, it mostly lives up to what’s advertised but with one important caution. While going through function familiarity, be careful of the Smart Return To Home (RTH) function. The assumption is the drone will simply return to the take-off GPS coordinates, but is not the case. Ive done this several times with the same results. When the RTH function is pressed, the drone becomes stationary and then begins a steady accent. The problem is the altitude the drone climbs too can be disturbing if GPS distance, trees, or wind are a consideration. Once the drone reached this uncomfortable altitude, it progressed ""very slowly"" towards its take-off GPS coordinates. Obstacles and winds should be considered as there is the possibility of losing the drone in the RTH mode. I contacted Holy Stone about the RTH and was not offered any acceptable explanation with exception of basic or rudimentary questions that were answered at my initial contact with them. I truly believe there is a language barrier but in fairness they do respond and their customer relations is better than average. My personal explanation is the drone climbs in order to receive a GPS signal, and again the height can be a problem with the drone not avoiding obstacles. My suggestion is to test the RTH in a wide area void of any obstacles and as a practical manner, avoid the RTH unless absolutely necessary.  All the other functions worked as advertised and only suggest beginners take small steps while becoming familiar. I would also suggest buying an additional battery and charge cord as it can take up to 4 hours to charge a single battery.",[],B074YYVXQH,B0C3QB6KZB,AE2ZCKNEGMODVT2342ULEND2VPLQ,1555531092156,1,True
