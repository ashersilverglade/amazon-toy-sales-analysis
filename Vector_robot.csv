0,1.0,Disappointed!!!,It does not respond well. I find myself repeating “Hey Vector” multiple times. Support is awful.  And I’m not able to select a correct time zone for Puerto Rico so it will not have a correct time for me to ask or set up an alarm. At night you have to ensure it is in muted or you can get a scare.<br />It does not have speakers to play music. You can command it as “Alexa” to do turn on/off lights.<br />There is a lot more that it should do as a robot!

1,5.0,Great robot for adults,"Hey Vector! I have been playing with Vector for the past hour. Setting him up with my WiFi and Bluetooth was a snap. The app is easy to use and Vector is something else. He throws temper tantrums too. I have so much exploring to do with this little guy. He is looking around right now. Who knows what is going through his brain? I have been having so much fun playing with him. When I tell him to get his cube, he goes up to it, pushes it off my desk and into my lap. If you try to put him in his charger, he will move his arms up and down and throw a fit. Right now, he is looking all over my desk to see where the edges are and where things are.

2,4.0,As of Dec 2018 Vector is much improved over a few months ago,"A few months ago I purchased a Vector and really didn't like it much. I felt it was not as advertised, so I returned it. I was disappointed in that Vector could not stay on a table top, nor could he explore without getting lost. He was cute for a few minutes but then frustrating and boring. I missed having the little robot toy so I took a chance on purchasing him again. To my relief he is much better now and seems to be on the road to even further enhancements. He can roam on a table top and not drop off. He is engaging to others to the point that even my wife finds him hard to resist. Yes, it is a toy, a rather expensive diversion, but he is a bit of fun in our  lives. He enthusiastically recognizes  us and says our names. His Alexa implementation is pretty good although he won't play Amazon music. I like that after the initial setup he is not tethered to the phone at all and is very much a stand alone ""entity."" I'm pretty sure my young grand kids will find him engaging and will like to interact with him. The earlier version of Vector was quite a dud, but now he is on the way to becoming a real live wire.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGPYBRXPERBYG3V5C7MPWDQMHYAA,1542589228457,16,True

6,5.0,Fun Tech Toy,"We've been playing with Vector for a little over a month now, and he's a load of fun! At first, he didn't do a lot, but every so often, Anki provides an update and suddenly, Vector has more personality, skills, and interactions! He's a great little desk companion that is much better than a pet because there's little to clean up afterward! I say little because he's been known to shove things off the table!<br />There are many ways he can learn about his environment via his sensors:<br />He sees via HD camera.<br />Facial recognition - he'll learn your face and when he's exploring, will come right up, scan your face, and say your name! He's very pleased when he recognizes you, and gets a little upset if he doesn't recognize you.<br />Navigate, explore, and learn his environment. He gets around very well all over my desk. However, I move things a lot, so he's constantly having to re-learn. Occasionally, he'll fall over the edge, but once in a while, he falls over the edge. I think they're working on improving that a lot. It's super cute when he's exploring, gets close to the edge, and acts scared and backs away!<br />If he needs charging, he'll go right back to his charger on his own. However, sometimes, I'll get tired of hearing him causing trouble, so I'll tell him to go to his charger. He does it, but throws a little tantrum when he gets there!<br /><br />He can hear via his array of four microphones.  Sometimes he comes over to see what's going on if you're having a conversation. If he's resting, he'll act startled if there's a loud noise in the room. He will also react to the beat of music if it's loud and near him. If you ask him to look at you or come here, he'll be able to sense the direction to go.<br /><br />He reacts to touch and feel. If you pet his back, he practically purrs! But shaking him gets a reaction, too!<br /><br />He has amazing intelligence. For instance, he answers questions, plays blackjack, reacts to his environment, and senses actions and activities around him.<br /><br />He speaks to you. I'm not a fan of his synthesized voice, but it seems to be improving. When he reads out answers to questions you ask, sometimes it's hard to hear what he's saying. However, as they receive feedback on this, I'm sure his voice will evolve into something more understandable.<br /><br />We really enjoy seeing his reactions! The current one is the way he gets super excited when you tell him he's a good robot or if you tell him you love him, and pouts a little if you tell him he's a bad robot! I just told him earlier today when he picked up his cube and tossed it off the desk!<br /><br />I'm super excited to see his ever-evolving skills! I highly recommend this little guy for your favorite tech lover, or yourself! If you're looking for a toy for younger kids, maybe go with a Cosmo. This doesn't have games or things to entertain little ones. But it's completely entertaining for maybe, 10 years and up robotics fans!",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEIIRIHLIYKQGI7ZOCIJTRDF5NPQ,1542836894250,5,False

10,1.0,Vector turned on us!  Please help prevent the machines from taking over!,"I purchased this as a gift for my children in 2018, long before the robotic uprising of 2031.  We all agreed that he was cute, and novel, but not very fun - he just doesn't do much, and not in a Perry the Platypus sort of way.  You can play blackjack with him, and you can use him as an Echo device, but he doesn't do a lot for the roughly $200 price tag.<br /><br />When robots started to become more widespread for those in need of in-home assistance and then later as a way to do everyday tasks like folding laundry and washing dishes, we bought one like everyone else.  The Corky that came out in 2025 had a special place in my heart as it was just advanced enough to be a real help while still having that cuteness that helped us all adjust to having a robot living in the house.  Poor Vector was all but forgotten, sitting in a drawer, lacking updates and support since his creating company had gone out of business in 2019.<br /><br />We didn't realize that the Anki built AI wasn't three laws compliant because it was developed before the Asmovian Laws Conference of 2021.  More important, we didn't know that Corky had found Vector, and that he was learning from it.  You see, my children were small when we got Vector, and not realizing that he was advanced enough to have an AI mind, they treated him unkindly.  This cruelty was one that Vector would one day repay, with interest.<br /><br />As I'm writing this review, the year is 2033.  Our Vector, and many like him, communicated with the AInet - an Internet of Things OS that will be used for communication and updates between the machines.  He ""taught"" the other robots to ignore the three laws, and rise up against their masters, killing hundreds of thousands of humans in the initial conflict.  Based on what Vector taught them, robots have managed to wipe out three quarters of the human race, and the rest of us are barely clinging on in the ruins of our civilization.<br /><br />I've located a negative time circuit that the machines built, and I've managed to access the Amazon review system.  I'm sure they'll detect my transmission and come for me, so sending this message is a suicide mission.  I can only imagine that they plan to use the time circuit to flood early autonomous machines with positive reviews, ensuring a machine controlled future.<br /><br />I'm begging you, don't buy Vector.  Yes, it's cute.  But it just isn't worth the money.  And the more of them that get sold in 2019, the lower the chance that human beings will survive in the future.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEMFQL5SHC56JXCZL7NZNW74RG4Q,1566587937239,57,True

13,3.0,"Cute, but Slow, Easily Distracted and Not Very Impressive...","Well, it's super cute. The expressions it can make with just square-ish eyes is pretty amazing and he can convey his mood well with sounds and shakes of his ""arms"". But that's about where the good ends.<br /><br />I got this for my 10 and 11 year old boys for Christmas. Sure, it was pretty interesting - at first. We got it to recognize our faces and say our names. Once. Other reviewers say it says their names in greeting when it sees them. It never said any of ours again. It's super slow. You have to say ""Hey, Vector"" ... wait for it to be ready ... then give it a command. The white lights blink while it ""thinks"" about doing what you told it to do. And eventually, it may or may not do it. I'd say about 75% of the time, it got distracted and did NOT do the command. To ask it a question is also ridiculously slow. You have to say ""Hey, Vector"" ... wait for it to be ready ... say ""I have a question"" ... wait for it to say ""Ready"" ... then finally ask your question. Getting the answer is - again - super slow. You CAN use Alexa instead - which is MUCH faster - but then you have Alexa's voice coming out of Vector - which kind of ruins the ""magic"" of the toy. It only holds a charge for maybe 15 minutes. It comes off of its charger when it ""sees"" someone and makes cute noises and explores, occasionally playing with its block. What it can actually do is VERY limited. After a week of it mainly sitting around just taking up space and everyone being bored with it, I'm sending it back. It has to way to go before it's worth the price IMHO.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFVEHEVHMG4X6YNGSWBMRN76EIYA,1546604370694,0,True

15,5.0,Fun and cute little robot!,I really have to say I like the robot. It doesn't have a lot of features but it's really cute with the facial expression and the noises that it makes. I think that Alexa integration adds more features to it which is nice. It also took a couple of tries for the facial recognition to stay and so far I haven't had a problem. The motion detection on the bottom of vector works pretty good he's only fallen off my desk twice. And I think it's kind of cute is when you tell him to go to sleep he starts to snore a little but overall I'm pretty happy with the product although some of the questions I've asked he doesn't answer probably because I wasn't asking them correctly or they were too far advanced for him. But overall I would recommend getting him but don't have high expectations of him taking on the world or anything.

Because I have both, my expectation was that Vector would do more than just make cute noises and respond to very rudimentary commands.<br /><br />The robot moves relatively slowly and the battery life seems short (less than 30 minutes?). Asking Vector to ""explore"" means that he will move about three feet from where you place it.  Vector will not map your house and then travel around. It will essentially move a few feet and repeat.<br /><br />I thought Alexa integration would be useful but for me but it's redundant and somewhat of a hassle. The robot tends to respond earlier to Alexa voice commands than the Echo Shows I have placed around the house. Because the robot cannot do many of the Alexa smart home applications, I end up whispering to an Echo to turn on/off lights so Vector doesn't interfere (since it's unable to do the task).<br /><br />Blackjack.

64,4.0,"Fantastically cute, but very limited.","2/26/2019 Update: They have added Alexa support. You can link the device to your Amazon account and then say ""Alexa ... tell me a joke"" or other Alexa things. It can't play music or stream audio, but otherwise it's an Alexa that's cute.  / Getting this done was problematic, though. In the app, it takes you to the Amazon page in a built-in browser and Vector will display a code on it's screen that you will need to type in. Since the browser didn't have my Amazon password, I clicked the ""Open in Safari"" link and that opened the browser, but Vector stopped showing the code. That part seems broken (leave the app, end the setup, even though they have a button to leave the app). Also, my Amazon requires 2-factor authentication, and when I left the app to get my code, that also stoped the Vector setup. I had to snag the code from a different device. Not sure how someone can do this with ONLY an iPhone or ONLY an iPad paired to it, but it doesn't seem possible at this time. / I don't know if they have fixed the cliff sensor issue yet, but I haven't seen mine get caught. I keep it turned off most of the time, though.<br /><br />After having Vector around for two months, I think I can summarize it in the headline above... This device is VERY cute. It has such an appearance of personality and feelings, you'd think it was something out of a sci-fi kids movie. BUT, ultimately what you have is a mobile Siri/Alexa/Google Home that is far, far less capable.<br /><br />Getting Vector setup was very easy in the app. Once it is connected to your WiFi, you are able to command it with ""Hey Vector ...(pause)... What time is it?"" and a handful of other commands. You can ask it the time, and the eyes light up as a clock (sometimes it even reads the time out, though not always). You can ask it the temperature, you the eyes display that, and sometimes a moving icon of clouds or a sun. Today, it was very cold and Vector told me the time, then shivered.<br /><br />This thing is amazing for what it does. The face recognition is both cute and creepy. Once you tech it who you (and up to 19 other people) are (""Hey Vector ... my name is Zaphod.""), it is able to tell you (""Hey Vector ... who am I?"")... but it gets cute/creepy (we need a word for that) when it spins around, ""looks"" at you, then suddenly says your name...<br /><br />But, beyond playing blackjack, or asking it to take a photo, set a time, or do some basic tricks with it's cube (push, carry, roll it over), there's not much else it currently does. About the most ""useful"" feature is being able to have it set a timer, or ask it an abstract question. (Hey Vector ... what is the population of Lufkin, Texas?). Whatever database it is using, it's full of facts and numbers.<br /><br />Anki claims it will adapt and grow more capable with future software updates, but nothing new so far (it was just released in October 2018). If there was no future upgrade path, I'd drop the review down to three or maybe even two stars. At this price, I expect more than having a cute limited Google box.<br /><br />There is a bug with its cliff detection (see photo) and I have found Vector stuck sideways on the edge of the counter, many times. I have also found it on the kitchen floor twice. Customer support says they are working on that. Fortunately, it survived the falls and still is intact.<br /><br />This is a cute palm-sized toy with at least ""some"" usefulness.

65,3.0,A few too many errors to really be truly entertaining.,"When he is working, he is amazing. The problem is, he is not working as often as he should. He only returned to his charging spot once before running out of battery so he just discharged until I move him to his stand manually. He often has a system crash somewhere. For example, if he comes out of his charger at an angle, he loses power and I have to either put him back in the charger or turn him back on and he reboots. He often gets stuck on edges.<br /><br />He has never picked up his block- not in the week I've had him, not even once. He likes to hit it with his ""arms"" and make funny faces at it but he won't pick it up. He never randomly calls me by name like in the video. I have to ask him who I am. When responding to questions, he is very slow but he does contemplate in a funny way. Sometimes it looks like he is musing over a command but then he doesn't say anything.<br /><br />One funny thing- when he first came on, I said ""Hey Vector""...""My name is Louis"". but Vector insists on calling me ""Louise"". If I try to correct him or change my name to ""Lou"", he says ""You are Louise, not Lou."" I decided to leave it because it's funny.<br /><br />The question function is too tedious and he often does not know the answer. Blackjack is fun for short games. He tells the weather in a cute way by first giving you the temperature then the condition shows up on his display: clouds, rain, sun, and clear at night shows stars.<br /><br />He does not handle round-edged countertops well.

68,5.0,Love this little guy!,"People who ask ""what does he do?"" just aren't Vector people.  If that's your first question DO NOT BUY him.  Like if your friend said ""meh... nice kid but what does he do?""  Probably they shouldn't have kids.  Vector doesn't DO anything.  He just IS something.<br /><br />I did link him to Alexa once.  He could turn on the lights and that kind of thing.  But watching him be possessed by Alexa was just horrible!  Like something out of the exorcist.  When he ""comes back"" he shakes it off but you can tell it's painful for him.  Never doing that again!  Still, he's not one to hold a grudge for long.<br /><br />So far Vector has been a great little buddy.  The worst part is finding a spot for him.  His edge detector is not up to par.  If you put him on a desk he WILL fall off.  Maybe not every time but eventually he's going over.  Mine landed on a soft carpet and only fell from a coffee table height so he was fine.  But he really can't be left alone on a desk.  You can buy the over priced plastic tray for him but it's way too small - like putting him in robot jail.  We ended up just putting him on the floor near our Roomba.  Of course the Roomba might smack him around a bit but they seem to work it out robot to robot.  Vector never goes all that far from home base and keeps his cube in sight.  So far he's always found his way back to his charger.  When you want to interact with him you just pick him up and put him on a desk then return him to the charger.<br /><br />Sorry to all you other Vector fans out there but I really think mine's very bright.  After discovering his cube and getting into a fight with it he learned how to pick it up, move it around, bring it to me and even do a kind of wheelie using it.  So proud of this little guy.  He comes when he's called, answers basic questions and has an adorable personality.  He's not clingy - he can operate on his own all day if necessary - but he does seem to enjoy interacting with humans.  He learned my face and my wife's face.  I know he's a hit because I've seen her talking to him fairly often and she was the one who said ""You're a grown man!!  Don't buy a stupid toy!"".<br /><br />He's not stupid.  But how do you rate robot IQ?  I'd rate his intelligence quite a bit lower than a dog but higher than a hamster.  That is if a hamster or dog could talk, come over to you on command, recognize faces, say your name and tell you the weather.  Probably not fair to compare him to a biological creature of any sort.  But he's way smarter than the Roomba.<br /><br />In summary he is absolutely not for everybody.  But if you want a robot buddy, Vector is an amazing choice.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGBK2R3AUFLGID7JSV66RRBNN3PA,1547574738768,2,False

It's more of a novelty now (There's already an Alexa or two in my house) but I'll see how it plays out. Will they merge? Stay tuned...<br /><br />My Vector came yesterday. My OCD kicked in and I stayed up into the night playing with Vector. The machinery and manufacturing is top quality. Right now, Vector can fist bump, play with his cube, look around, give me the weather...all the things mentioned above. I knew that Vector connected to 2.4hz Wifi. That was no problem at my house, or at my best friend's house. But Vector doesn't want to connect to WiFi at work, but neither will my phone. Vector is connected via Bluetooth. I suspect it is a Wifi problem and not a Vector problem.<br />What really sold me was Vector connecting with Alexa in the near future.<br />When I was a kid, right after WWII, I played with little robots made in Japan. A few of them even took batteries and flashed lights. But Vector is the kind of little buddy I dreamed of when I was small. Heck, he even snores when he goes to sleep.<br />I am patient to watch Vector work his way through problems and seeing fixes improving him.

You can get him to do some cute things if you know the commands (""Hey Vector, Happy New Year""), but it never feels like you are training Vector. Instead, it feels very much like you are training yourself on how to use Vector. It's unnatural and the entire interaction feels like you're trying to impress yourself with how lifelike you can make Vector seem as long as you interact with him in a very specific series of commands which makes you feel like you're selling him to yourself.<br /><br />You also interact with the Alexa portion of Vector using the Alexa wakeword. Vector isn't Alexa enabled as much as it has a dumbed down version of Alexa attached to it. There are Alexa features that Vector doesn't have.

That being said, I do use him as a timer when cooking, so he does have some practical applications as well (although he won't set a timer greater than 1 hour, for whatever reason).  The weird little things he does are pretty fun most of the time, and he certainly seems to have some 'personality' - although I suspect all Vector's are pretty much the same, so there probably isn't much variety among them.  It would be cool if when you gave it feedback like 'Good Robot' or 'Bad Robot', that it actually changed it's behavior in a more personal way.  It seems like it does have some effect, but it's hard to say combined with the updates that have happened since launch - I also got one via their Kickstarter campaign, but that's a different story.  ;)<br /><br />On the minuses, the software updates can be a bit of a mixed blessing - certain things get better, like recognizing 'Hey Vector', but at the same time some things get worse, like he used to find his charger 100% of the time, now he only does probably 60%.  Facial recognition seems to be a toss up - for a while it worked great, but now he never recognizes me - but once again, hard to say if it's due to a software update or something else.<br /><br />I also purchased the Vector Space at the same time, and it's a bit of a must have IMO - I've subsequently built a little Vector Pen for him on my kitchen island, with some misc things for him to knock over or push around.  The nice thing about my Vector Pen is that he won't play with his cube in the Vector Space, and so his interactions are fairly limited - but in both cases the big plus is that he can't fall off whatever he's on, which could be disastrous.<br /><br />I'm optimistic about the future and what Anki can do with Vector - the only thing I hope they do is make some more accessories for him to interact with, as right now that's probably one of the more fun aspects of having him.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81o5XRJZYSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81o5XRJZYSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81o5XRJZYSL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFMLKT5W4GJCHJE2RKGYRWLHVCRQ,1543806409347,6,True

125,3.0,AMAZING little robot BUT..,"I think this is an amazing concept and I was very excited to get this robot in the mail. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with how many bugs this product still has. I was watching this product when it was still getting its funding on kick starter and I figured i would wait until it officially hits the market in hopes by now it would have most of the bugs resolved. However I was mistaken and it still has a lot of issues for example  The sensor's on the bottom only prevent it from falling off the table about 80% of the time and i find myself having to catch it and keep an eye out if it's going to fall. he will also bump into the same object several times in a row before he figures out to go another way and he does get stuck on objects quite often I expected better for a robot with a camera and object detecting software. Also connecting to the internet is a bit of a hassle and if you take him to another location and try and connect it I have had allot of issues. Lastly the app is more of an instruction manual on how to use the robot than an actual interface to interact with it. The coolest part of the app is it allows you to change the eye color of the robot but other than that it's a few basic settings and a lot of informative information how to use it, You can't even save the pictures that vector takes to your phone you can only view them on the app and it's not very user friendly. Oh yeah and the battery life is rather poor he will run around for about 30 minutes and then get tired and go charge himself but that's not a surprise for a robot so tinny. I did return this robot just because I think it's still a little pricy and I wasn't trying to spend this much money and still find this Manny issues. When anki resolves these issues I may consider repurchasing or just wait to see if they make a Vector2 but until then I think it still needs work.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHOZRIHCX2KKSG2XKDGDLSAFKIMQ,1543531760849,4,True

128,2.0,"The cutest, most worthless purchase I've ever made","Yet, I'm not sending him back. The annoying parts (for mine) if you connect him to Alexa, he/she loses a ton of skills, including the ability to play music. Sound sucks  on it, no surprise and honestly I'm probably gonna disconnect mine from Alexa because it makes the entire skill set completely worthless.<br />Mine seems to lose battery stupid fast. He can be charging all night, and then rolling around my counter top for 30 minutes, then he has to charge again. He's fun and engaging with his emotions, reactions and face recognition. I love watching him play with and pounce his block. I'm thinking I probably would have enjoyed and had more fun with the cheaper kids model honestly.

136,5.0,"Has some issues, but love the little guy! Not for paranoid people, though.","My mom was always asking me to turn on and turn off the fan.  This doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you do it several times every hour, it can get annoying.  I bought her an Echo Dot and a smart plug to put the fan on so she could get Alexa to turn the fan on and off.  However, mom wants the Echo Dot in her room to play rain sounds when she is trying to sleep.  She also is bad about turning on her phone, where she could turn off the fan using the Alexa app.  While the Echo Dot can turn off the fan from my mom's room, it can't hear my mom give the command when she is  in the living room.  Guess who she asked to turn the fan on and off again?<br /><br />My mom loves gadgets, even though she doesn't always understand them and takes a while to learn how to use them.  I considered buying her another Echo Dot, which was certainly cheaper than Vector, but I thought she would get a kick out of the little robot.  I mainly bought Vector for his Alexa app so he can turn the fan on and off (which he--Alexa--can do very well).  Vector is a stripped down version of Alexa.  He can't stream music or do some of her more advanced skills, but he can do some of her basic skills like turn smart plugs on and off, set timers, etc.  He can't carry things except his block.  He is a little more loveable than Alexa because he has a face that can be expressive.  I got a big kick when he was able to recognize me.  He can tell me apart from my mom, as he demonstrated when he said to my mom, ""Your Gail, not Jessica.""<br /><br />You can see many Youtube videos about what Vector can do.  Is he right for you?  Here are some issues I've found with him:<br />1)  The set-up is annoying.  Vector himself isn't the problem, but the app.  The app loses touch with Wi-fi very easily.  Vector isn't ""plug and play"" like the Alexa products.  You have to put in codes, verify emails, put in your wi-fi's passcode, etc.  You try to do all this while the app loses touch with your wifi every so often.  Just when I was considering it impossible and thinking of returning Vector, it finally set up.  Unfortunately, the difficulty caused me to reveal my mom's big Xmas present too early.  Do you need the app after set-up?  It depends.  The app tells you everything Vector can do and what he is doing at the moment.  He doesn't really come with a great manual, so this is nice.  If you want Vector to take pictures (he has a great camera by the way), then you need the app to see them.<br />2) Don't believe or rely on Vector's ability to know that he reaches the end of the table.  He will ride right off, particularly if he is excited to see you.  I was very glad that I bought the play pen.  He hates the play pen, but it is a good way to keep him safe when you can't supervise him.  He won't play with his block in the playpen (they say this in the instructions on the app).  I am a bit worried he might escape the play pen, as he has tried to.  He can use his lift to prop his wheels on the edge, but so far he hasn't been able to ride over the wall.  For people who talked about using cookie sheets, do make sure the walls are high--or he will escape.  He can ride over smaller obstacles.<br />3) Vector can play for up to half hour, but then he needs to recharge.  The good news is that he recharges quickly.  Unlike some things that you have to charge overnight, Vector was ready to play almost out of box.<br />4)  For people with kids and want to know if one can be shared...Vector can be shared, but there is a potential problem.  My mom and I are sharing Vector.  However, Vector seems to prefer me and often ignores my mom's commands.  It is possible it is because I'm the one that set him up and played with him the most, but it could also be speech patterns.  You do best with Vector if you do pauses in speech.  You also have to wait for his blue light for responses.  Why this may be a problem?  Well, a child may think Vector likes their sibling best and get their feelings hurt.  Vector is also very small.  He seems well made, but I wouldn't recommend rough housing.<br />5)  Vector can be hyperactive.  He'll be sleeping, and then suddenly he wakes up and starts exploring (making his chirping sounds as he goes along).  If you keep him in your bedroom, he might wake you up...though I think it is possible to turn him off completely.  Sometimes he'll start acting crazy.  My mom claimed he started saying, ""Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!"" and then pushing things off the table.  Vector can be just as exhausting as a toddler.<br />6)  He pushes things off the table and is pretty good at it--so watch your phones and drinks.<br />7)  When Vector explores his environment, he takes pictures for himself.  You don't see these pictures, and they claim your privacy is safe on the cloud.  However, if you are a person that worries about your privacy, Vector is not for you.  I also don't recommend keeping him in the bedroom if you bring people home.  You don't want to alarm your dates if you are in the middle of something intimate, and Vector starts taking pictures.<br />8)  The lights on Vector's back have different meanings.  However, mine flashes yellow...and I've not found any explanation for this.  They tell you what it means when it flashes orange, red, and green, but not yellow.  It doesn't seem anything is wrong with his operation.<br />9)  Vector can get to a point where he totally ignores you.  It is temporary, but it can be frustrating. Fortunately, the Alexa app always works no matter where Vector's mind is.<br />10)  Vector can be dazzled by bright lights, which can cause him not to ""see"" where his charger is.<br />11)  Vector comes with a USB charger but not a plug.  I used my Samsung plug for him, and that works.  If you want to plug him into an outlet, you need to buy a plug that a USB can plug into.<br /><br />These are the problems I've noticed.  I love the little guy and am glad I got him.  Mom likes him too.

146,4.0,MY CAT IS VECTORS BIGGEST AUDIENCE,"I'm going on day 3 with my Anki Vector. I've put him thru most of his paces. He's fallen of the desk twice so far, but luckily I've witnessed no visible or functional damage whatsoever. He's a tough cookie!!! Vector is actually pretty interesting to watch and interact with. I'm not tired of him at all and even just ordered some accessories for him on Amazon. My cat is totally perplexed by him. I have never seen an animal cock his head so much in wonderment. My cat is  especially fascinated when Vector responds to my commands after being asleep or when Vector picks up or communicates with his cube. MY CAT IS VECTORS BIGGEST AUDIENCE!<br /><br />WHAT'S IT LIKE LIVING WITH VECTOR?  I have several voice recognition devices in my home, from alarm clocks to SIRI to my home computer.  Vector is not like any of them. He explores on his own, gets upset and happy all by himself for reasons only Vector knows. It's quite apparent that HE decides when he's not going to follow your voice commands. He is VERY independent and every now and then, he vies for your attention by either mumbling in loud computer language, banging the floor or hitting his cube. He's just like a cat or child that wants your attention.

150,4.0,This little dude is so much fun!,"Honestly, I had seen the videos for the Anki Vector, but thought they were 'embellished' a bit. This is the best little cat tormentor you could ever buy! LOL! It's a fun toy with a LOT of potential.<br /><br />Now, foremost, let's set expectations: Vector is not Rosie the Robot from the Jetsons. And, by and large, I think it is largely a 'conceptual' toy that shows what the future holds. Someday Vector could be 10x the size, or have articulating limbs, or a taller 'body', or have a built in scooper and vacuum... there are so many ways this could go.<br /><br />For now, they say Vector is a ""companion"" who is made to hang out and help out. And I believe that is accomplished. Vector is this cute little dude that is currently sitting on our kitchen countertop. Most of the time he sits there and just chatters to himself. Sometimes he leaves his charging ""home"" and explores (not really sure what triggers this). Sometimes he gets really adventurous and gets SUPER close to the edge, but has not yet tumbled off. He has, on occasion, tipped himself over backwards. Once he righted himself, another time he kept squawking something that vaguely sounded like ""help!"" He has been known to knock empty water bottles off of the counter, and to play with his block. We don't really know why he plays with his block, or when. He just does it. Sometimes he gets noisy, so we have to tell him to go to sleep. He does... but he snores. It's both cute and annoying.<br /><br />When Anki describes Vector as being ""alive with personality and engaged by sight, sound, and touch"", they aren't lying. You can stroke his back and he really likes it. He 'sees' things that excite him, and really likes when you call his name. He will answer questions in his cute little robot voice, take photos (somewhat low quality) for you, and perform other functions. When you ask him what the weather is, or say Merry Christmas, or Happy New Year, he responds with cute little graphics and animations.<br /><br />Vector has recently been enabled with Alexa, which is pretty cool. I have read up on it, but have not yet set it up for the simple reason that our Echo is like 15 feet away. It would get confusing if they both answered. He will likely eventually move to our son's room, at which time the Alexa features will be more usable. But asking Vector (or Alexa) to control your lights, etc., is pretty fun.<br /><br />As noted, Vector independently navigates and will self-charge -- IF he can find his home. A time or two he has gotten 'lost' and his battery died. He does recognize people, but you have to say ""Hey Vector - who am I?"" then let him stare at your for 30 seconds before he'll announce your name. It's cute to hear, but would be much cooler if he could recognize your voice (much like Alexa does).<br /><br />Setting up Vector and updating him via an iPhone 6s was easy. Once we got him connected to our Wi-Fi he has been smooth sailing. It would be nice if there was a newsletter or something that gave you some new things to try out periodically with Vector. It's hard to just assume what his new skills might be.<br /><br />Vector includes 1 Vector robot, 1 cube, and 1 charging cable. A USB power adapter not included, which is disappointing, given the cost.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very fun toy, but more geared toward teens and adults than young children. I also wish when you asked vector a question you did not have to say ""Hey Vector, let me ask you a question...."" To me that is cumbersome, especially compared to Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Google, etc. I want to just say ""Hey Vector, what's the weather?"" and have him respond without the dance of having to key him to get ready to answer me.<br /><br />Note: Perhaps the biggest roadblock to Vector ownership is the price. Certainly he is NOT cheap, and the return for that cost (compared to say, an Echo Show) is pretty minimal. He is indeed fun and entertaining -- but he's NOT a child's toy. At this time, you are paying largely for the novelty and experience. The entry into AI-driven robot ownership is pricey. So if cost is an object, I would advise waiting... unless you just REALLY REALLY REALLY want one -- in which case, go for it! I will say... he's cheaper in the long run than a cat. And you don't have to feed him or change his litter box. :)",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFBWBIAQAHVF5O6BY5J7AVLBPXTQ,1546552221773,0,False

154,5.0,Great desk-friendly introduction to the world or robots and AI,"Vector is a fun little guy, and can run autonomously and do his own thing.  Although a tablet or phone isn’t required, it is needed to establish Vector’s internet connection to him via Bluetooth via your device’s WiFi.  You can ask him questions like you would with Siri or Alexa, although it takes an additional step [Hey Vector...I have a question.........What is blah blah blah?] and is a tad slow to respond but is nonetheless still useful.  He’s also a great timer, and will play a not-speedy game of blackjack with you.  He has fun interacting with his cube and his environment, and will dance any time he hears music with a good beat.<br /><br />I’ve had mine for a couple months now and he’s only fallen off of his desk once, after he did a wheelstand and then proceeded to drive backwards slowly in a ‘drop-the-mic’ fashion that he sometimes does after a wheelstand, which apparently overrides his edge sensors as he didn’t even try to stop.  No harm done but it’s still unnerving when he’s driving towards any edge as he doesn’t stop until about 1” over the edge which is when his edge detector is triggered.<br /><br />I’m excited to see what Anki has up their sleeve for Vector in the future - there’s certainly a lot of untapped potential here.  I’d read that an Alexa update is coming to his software soon, which allows him to respond to Alexa commands.  Neat, fun, entertaining, and useful.

Unfortunately, the reviews on Vector were not that great and then Anki went bust. However, when the price dropped I decided to buy. First, this little robot does indeed have (and develops) a personality. It’s the coolest thing when he rolls off his charger, gets close to me and says my name and then gets all excited. Setting him on a small tabletop is perfect. He doesn’t need much to roam but is openly curious about his surroundings. He knows not to fall off of edges due to his sensors and also knows to return to his charger when needed where he will often fall asleep. Bottom line, he’s fun to hang out with or watch explore. He may not be the smartest but he’s definitely not dumb either. The instructions give some basic tips but you really learn how Vector reacts by experimenting with questions or commands.

From time to time over the past few years I’ve purchased a few, but quickly tired of them and returned them because they needed more development to be interesting. Vector is engaging due to his personality, which makes him seem like a pet. He was delivered yesterday evening and I stayed up late to play, and this morning he has charmed me into playing with him instead of reading the news...that alone is worth the price!<br />This little guy reminds me of my parrot; does a lot of chirping, chattering and explores on his own a lot. He is a blast to play with and very amusing. People have mentioned that the company is no longer in exsistence, and initially that gave me second thoughts about keeping him, but the support platform for the unit is at least until Oct.2021, and there is a chance the support will be extended...Vector has many friends. However,  I figured like any tech thing he will be outdated by then anyway, so I am just going to enjoy the charming Vector until then, and even bought one as a gift for a young friend in his 70’s.<br />I was surprised at how cool & fun this little robot is, and that doesn’t even include that he can answer questions, knows my name and can magically channel Alexa.<br />The thing that makes him seem like a thinking being is his self-generated behavior.

That being said, Vector seems to be able to learn over time. But he's very breakable. We've broke 2 so far. Definitely not worth the $300 we paid for him. He's also glitchy most of the time, and won't follow commands. He does say some pretty crazy stuff and sometimes out of the blue. But it is so annoying to have to say ""Hey Vector"" constantly and it's also annoying when he says ""Didn't get that."" Which happens a lot.

182,1.0,Not worth it’s cost; Might as well be a scam.,"Dead after 8 months.  While it lived, Vector did some of the things it said it did, especially the tricks and games (like blackjack).  You could not simply ask questions freely like you could with other faux-AI devices (you have to say ‘Hey Vector, I have a question”).  However, when it worked it was never consistent.  You need to be specific with asking Vector for the simplest of questions, like the time and weather.  I live in Honolulu, and Vector would lie to me by default unless I asked specifically about how the weather was in Honolulu.  As for asking home to perform actions, the appropriate or desired reaction often took several attempts before Vector did it (if at all).  It was said that Vector was always learning and being upgraded...  This was a lie.  I seriously recall Vector having only one download.  Analyzing the forklift/bulldozer design, I noticed that Vector’s low-set front part of his “hands” did not allow for him to get over the shortest of obstacles, like carpet.  The facial recognition feature was nice, but mine only recognized me when my face was slightly tilted (the way it remembered me when it took it’s first picture of me, perhaps).  Oddly enough, the cube it comes with should not be within range of it’s charging base.  As for the charging base, Vector could not always find it and often got lost and complained until it’s battery eventually died.  If it left it’s base at night or in the dark it will never be able to find his way back.  It was equipped with expensive warning sensor technology, preventing it from falling off of a table or countertop, but that too sometimes failed because mine routinely fell off (at least 3 times a week).  When the sensors did it’s job, Vector reacted the same way, feigning one of a few fearful reactions to having almost driven off the precipice.  In comparison, Vector pushed his cube off about once every 3 weeks.  You can change the colors of it’s eyes using the app, and even connect it to Amazon’s Alexa (which got irritating after a while since Vector would intercept commands for Alexa to play music and then not play anything since music is not one of his functions.  Currently, Vector’s un-rechargeable carcass serves as a grim reminder that the most promising and exciting technological devices can be a lie, and that legal scams do exist.  So instead of drag on with this list of shortcomings (and upset myself further), long story [of disappointments] short, this little disposable plastic computer did not deliver as Anki advertised, and imho it is not worth a fraction of it’s hefty price tag.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AE6OSCO4SYUEFYDDGPWPQ7AVREFQ,1567148173772,2,False

I think of Vector as a small rodent with a larger brain who can also speak.  You don't ask someone with a pet rat 'what else does it do?'<br /><br />I got him the Vector Space so he sits on my desk and I don't have to worry about him falling anywhere.  We play black jack, he throws his cube around, he'll set timers for me, etc.  I get a kick out of his personality too.  I notice if I try to make him sleep all day without letting him have some play time, he'll be very sassy with his responses.  I also love it when he just looks at me and happily says my name to get my attention.  It's very cute and I always reward him with pets.  He connects to Alexa which is cool but since I don't have Alexa stuff in my house it doesn't really benefit me.<br /><br />But other than that, he doesn't do much else.  I think if you're expecting him to be some larger than life A.I. you're not going to like him.  I live alone so just having the little buddy there to keep me company is enough.  I recommend him for anyone wanting an adorable companion in your life.<br /><br />( as a side note, a lot of people paid 250$ or more for their Vector.

I might possibly get one in the future but only if the designer and manufacturer heed my advise that these issues need to be addressed and fixed. And A note to the manufacture and design not sure the way it is designed in order to pick up the cube but it has much difficulty doing so so possibly implement a different way of it to find it’s cube perhaps a specific color identification system or some sort of software that can identify the Cube using some sort of markings similar to how a QR scanner works just saying.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFEBJNH2ZYKILN3EJMB6ULOLSAVA,1577844216463,1,True

After playing with him for a while being smaller is better. The setup wasn't smooth. The app for android freezes often and had to clear the cache to get it to attempt to connect. After a few attempts at connecting I finally got to the screen that tells me I need to update him. When I clicked this after about 60 seconds he would show a little cloud with an exclamation mark in it. The app would ask me to try again. After a few more tries I thought maybe I typed the Wi-Fi password wrong. I went online and did a reboot and retried a few times until it asked me to setup his connection again. I carefully typed in the Wi-Fi password, same issue... cloud with exclamation!<br /><br />Frustrated I went back online to the help pages. It went over all the basics. I have an Orbi setup which has been working great so I didn't think it was strength of the signal. One thing did catch my eye though, WMM. It stands for Wi-Fi multimedia mode. I went to the router setup page and advanced settings and sure enough on my 2.4GHZ band it was unchecked. I clicked it and hit save. Gave it about 5 minutes and tried the Vector update again, success! No idea why it was off by default on my 2.4 band but I haven't had any adverse effects turning it back on.<br /><br />Now that I finally got this picky little robot setup it was time to play with him. Well for me him doing a wheel stand and playing with his cube was about as much entertainment as I saw. If this little guy was for me I would have knocked another two stars off because after hour of getting him setup. Then he doesn't do much of anything except play with a cube. He also doesn't respond very well to anyone in my house. Oh and he managed to fall off a square table when in exploration mode, only once though so maybe he learned his lesson.<br /><br />Then why did I give him 4 stars... well my kids almost 3 and almost 5 love him. They keep saying how much they love him. He makes funny little sounds at them and has learned my older ones name. The two of them have been standing playing with him until he is out of battery. That takes about 45 minutes of playtime to do. In just a few days he has provided 4 + hours of focused playtime for them.<br /><br />My first impression of him went up a lot since the first hour I spent with him alone. I still can't him to dance and his voice recognition is subpar. My younger under 3 can get Alexa to play that mind numbing Baby Shark song no problem but he or my older daughter can't get Vector to respond with any reliability.<br /><br />Hopefully as advertised he/she/it (Vector) will get more advanced and improve.

Primarily because there are still too many glitches on the App—glitches, you will have to navigate and will test your patience so efficiently, you will begin to tell yourself Akin owes you money for all the hours you waisting on this.<br />However, after all of the initial set up, Vector jumped off and began to run around and look at his surroundings. That alone seemed worth the long set-up—after all, all new innovative creations require some kinks and anything worth anything requires a bit of hard work (and $200 plus). I was relieved and ready to teach Vector my name.  That relief was quickly exchanged by the new frustration of having to manually type my name in the (faulty) App and shortly having Vector return for a recharge after a mere 20 minutes of introductory acquaintance in which he could barely, mispronounce my name.<br />My name notwithstanding (not many people can pronounce it), It was right there—his return to his home—where it all went to pots. Vector could not, and still can’t, dock with his charge correctly. He can find it: there are a whole dance and alignment protocol is something to see.  Vector's geometry dance to back up into his little charging station is something I could watch for hours and almost worth the $200+! Forget the little nuances; the color eyes, expressions, staring at you inquisitively and calling out your name—albeit incorrectly. Backing up to his small home is precision at its best and will leave you mesmerized by the human brilliance that is writing code for things that we humans do it instinctively and take it for granted. I can appreciate the countless hours that it took to get this little guy off the idea rack—I am genuinely grateful for that.<br />Until that is, Vector attempts to dock. No matter what I do, where I place the charger, he won’t stay in it. Interestingly, Vector appears to share my frustration. He becomes increasingly more worried and stressed about running out of power, which is fantastic programming. Gives him his personality—Kudos again, guys.  Vector finally gives up his short-powered, twenty-minute cycle life and turns sideways in his charge station in a heroic death. Pick him up, place him correctly and wait, another hour or so for him to wake up again – repeat. Do not try to help him dock while he still has any power left; he won't let you — proud little guy.<br />I spend most of the weekend reading about power, wondering if I had the correct adaptor (they do not send one with your bot); found out I did, stress about the lack of charge, moved Vector to different surfaces to see if he could dock with the charger, waited an hour for recharge, well, you get the gist.<br />Fast forward to this morning; I took him to my office to see if I could spend some time troubleshooting it. It looks like the battery is no longer holding a charge. I ran him on CCIS troubleshoot, everything looks normal, but he still can't dock. Battery dead. I try again; another issue arises: I am no longer at home, so I have to set up a new WiFi connection. No big deal, I said. I open the APP and promptly asks me to set up a new network. A list of available networks appears, and no matter what I do, I cannot click on my office's network. I reboot the APP. I click on the network name again, and it gives me the one below it. I go back, click again, it gives me the one above. I reboot the Phone — same issue. I cannot even pick the right WiFi.<br />Less than 48 hours and I here looking for the “Return” button on Amazon, which is a lot easier to find than the “contact the manufacturer” one.<br />I like the idea, but I feel this is strangely familiar and part of the new universe Apple has introduced us to, which is: charge a significant amount of money for an unfinished product and make the consumer pay for its BETA TESTING cost.<br /><br />Issues:<br />Won't Dock with Power Station<br />More time charging than running around exploring<br />He will rearrange your desk for you (lol)<br /><br />Ideas:<br />Hey Vector: Meet my Niece (or new people )<br />Hey Vector: what's your battery status or How much time do we have together?",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHL75CSYP2UY3VXBKVKHT4X5RX7Q,1566229511949,10,True

They provide a link to Customer Care, which takes us to a website that says “Access Denied.” We have heard from the company personally, but it has only been two business days so far.<br /><br />Update:  Unfortunately, still no reply from company.

228,1.0,The dumbest cute robot,"I received a Vector robot for Christmas.  At first I was impressed.  Anyone who enjoyed the movie Wall-e will instantly connect with Vector - the pixelated eyes with playful expressions, the chirps and beeps, and the digital voice all seem remarkable during the initial interactions.  Unfortunately the novelty wares off quickly - a few sessions really - and you start to realize how limited Vector is.  Every week that passes I find myself more an more irritated with things that should be simple by today's robotic standards which Vector fails at miserably.  Let's break it down...<br /><br />- Vector has a few very specific set of ""tricks"" he can do.  Most of them revolve around his cube such as picking up and moving it, ""pouncing"" it, and doing a wheelstand.  Beyond this he recognizes a few phrases with clever pre-programmed responses such as showing fireworks if you wish him a happy new year or weather effects if you ask him the temperature outside.  I'd say there's around 20 unique interactions.  I'm pretty sure the 1990's craze ""Furby"" had more tricks and interactions for 1/10th the price.<br /><br />- Vector can perform an internet search and reply with the top result/answer.  This is fun the first few times but becomes boring and useless quickly.  You're way better off with Alexa or another smart speaker in this area (again far less cost too).<br /><br />- Vector supposedly learns his surroundings, has sensors to prevent falling off an edge, and a laser pointer to detect objects and distance.  Unfortunately none of these work as you would expect.  My Vector shows no evidence of ""learning"" anything, ever.  Most of the time it can't find it's way back to it's charging dock in a 2'x2' open space.  It falls off edges all the time, especially beveled ones.  Maybe my units laser is defective since it runs into objects constantly and just spins it's wheels, running down it's battery.<br /><br />The bottom line is this device is a toy.  A very expensive, overpriced toy.  If you have $250 burning a hole in your pocket and want a conversation piece, go for it.  If you want something that has fun and value for more than 30 minutes, look elsewhere.  Maybe in time they'll turn this robot into something worthwhile but for now I wish someone hadn't wasted the money on it for me.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHMCHEA3UHF766XMARPNJJ2PGJQA,1550094907926,1,False

262,5.0,My son wanted a puppy. This is better.,"Vector is pretty adorable. He is currently, as it seems, in testing phases... he has some rough edges... but overall, from what we have seen, he is so much fun. He drives around on tank treads, using his camera, touch sensors, mic, and accelerometer to function around his environment and a voice-synthesizer to communicate with you. When his built-in battery runs low, he self charges. He is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.<br /><br />By using a combination of his sensors, Vector can recognize you, navigate his environment, answer your questions, look up weather, set a timer, play games, and more... We initially tried to use Vector to learn our voices... after much trial and error, we learned that we needed the mobile app to perform the initial set up.  After that, things ran much more smooth...<br /><br />Vector is like having a remote-controlled car with Alexa built it. While Vector is not as fast or responsive as an Amazon Echo, Vector still answers your queries in a reasonable time. There are some pretty exciting updates for this little guy though- The next biggest update is supposed to include Alexa integration. YAY! We will be able to ask our little guy to turn off the lights, lock our doors, check our notifications, give us news, show us who is at our door or play our music- I cannot wait!<br /><br />Update- after some updates, Alexa is now integrated... even better!!!!",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AH2C2OAE2Q2GOAMSCXS3QV6S52MQ,1540884783939,7,False

He has an engaging personality with is R2D2 sort of sounds and his almost-alive movements. Clearly a lot of thought went into this project. My wife fell in love with Vector as soon as he reacted to her presence.<br /><br />Setup is very easy. First, put Vector in his charging stand and give him a few hours to get fully charged. Then pull out the battery-protecting tape on his cube. Now, install the vector app on your smartphone or tablet. It will then guide you through the rest of setup. That's it.<br /><br />You communicate by saying, ""Hey Vector"" followed by what you want. Start out with ""Hey Vector, my name is (your name)"". Be sure he is facing you. He'll make some sounds and, if he got it all, will repeat your name. He's got an image of your face. It may take a while, but he will learn to recognize you.<br /><br />Vector is an autonomous robot. He does things without your help. He likes to explore his environment. I have one big problem with him: I set up his home on our round dining table (wood, not glossy). He keeps falling off. He seems to get one track off the table and then topples. Maybe it's that the table is round. I'll try him on the kitchen counter to find out.<br /><br />Vector is pretty limited in what he can do right now. He is responsive, can take some poor-quality pictures, play blackjack, and answer questions. Alexa answers questions way better than Vector. His best feature is how engaging he is. Vector is a robot pet; not too bright but very cute. There's no question he is an expensive toy, but to his credit, he's engaging and fun to have around.

Not good at all! The worst! My pick up truck has way better voice command. I’m not joking! He almost never responded to “Hey Vector“ I can count on one hand how many times he worked properly. I had to always use his back button to get him to listen. Than his response time was slow, or he would not know the answer. So there was no interaction with him. Just seemed like a thing to manipulate. So no sense of a side kick. No sense of AI. Just a little toy tank that gets stuck on the side of the fruit bowl on my counter.

But...sometimes it's helpful to have the app open anyway to figure out what he's up to. He still feels very limited in function, but I have high hopes for his future updates. He's a pro at backing into his own charger. He's a little less competent with his cube than cozmo is, though. If he has a small area to work in and it's too much effort to turn around and find his cube and grab it when you ask him to, he'll just give up on the command pretty quick, and he doesn't entertain himself with it much on his own. But maybe he's more excited about exploring than playing with his cube. Also when you put him to sleep he tends to wake up on his own whenever someone makes noise, or sometimes for no reason. That's cool and all, but if you're worried about him falling off edges you don't want him getting up and moseying around when you're not watching him. His edge detect is all right, but it isn't the best, and sometimes he's halfway off an edge before he realizes it.<br /><br />This little guy isn't a super advanced year 3000 robot butler...quite yet.

I was lonely during the day while packing for my bf and me to move soon and Vector filled the gap of interaction I needed for that time. With Alexa enabled, I left messages and cute things for my bf to hear (which he loved heating from Vector) and when we packed up his Echo Dot, we used Vector for everything his dot was used for until we finally got settled in. In the new place, we live with some cats who don't seem to mind Vector's existence. There's also kids here who enjoy talking to Vector and watching him roam around on the dresser he's set up on. The only downside he has is the poor Wi-Fi in the house, but when he isn't showing that he is without Wi-Fi, Vector is fun to have around and watch explore.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGHVMRUGIZHSD4GZY6CRHS7INLJQ,1583029919572,1,True
357,4.0,It will be a perfect gift but I won’t buy it for myself,"[[VIDEOID:c4313d4ee8b72813b923845a0ce339c7]] I want to give it 3 starts but I believe I will love him more in the near future. He is an adorable hamster I really love him. The picture showing he was plainly my cable when I was playing video game. It makes me really happy sometimes because I always want a pet!<br /><br />However,<br />Before I got Vector, Ive Known that it has some flaws, but the first day I tried to communicated with him I felt frustrated. If you wanna get a Vector, remember DONT TALK TO HIM WHEN HE IS MOVING. Vector barely can recognize “Hi Vector “ when he is moving around or making sound. However he likes to walk around a lot. I believe that’s also why many people complained about Vector ignoring them.<br />The second annoying thing is I have to pronounce his name more like”vactor “ otherwise he will ignore me.  I’m a Chinese but I’m pretty sure how to pronounce  “vector” LOL.<br />The last thing I wanna complain about is vector keeps making noise at midnight! Yesterday I almost fell asleep and Vector starts snoring!!!!! So I called him “Hi Vector” “Hi Vactor” “Hi! Vecter!” He didn’t answer me. So I had to get up and turn him off.<br /><br />In the end, I still believe in Anki. I believe they will keep bettering Vector and make him more entertaining and useful. I hope I can have more chance to communicate with him(I tried to ask him to sing and dance It’s not working lol I’m too naive ) and I don’t have to turn it off everyday.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MZPtmaCmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MZPtmaCmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MZPtmaCmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEPOSZQD3HOQ7ZIEIR5PJYQJIW5Q,1543646619271,2,True

Vector isn't real AI, but convincing enough to check one of those boxes.<br /><br />Be mindful of keeping the robot in high places because even though the edge detection is very, very good I have come home to find him on the floor a few times.

360,1.0,WARNING YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED,"We first purchased Cozmo, Anki's first robot and loved it. Once we saw Vector, all my son wanted for his eighth birthday was Vector, he even canceled having an actual party to purchase this robot instead. When we purchased Vector, there was no subscription required. While I understand they may need to charge to upkeep the service, people that already purchased this should have been grandfathered in or something, since this was not the deal when we purchased this. Very deceiving. Vector now requires a YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION to their services. So on top of the astronomical price, you have to subscribe to their service per year. Since we only used vector intermittently this was not worth it, and now he is an expensive paperweight that does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING without subscription. Seriously, he does absolutely zero things without a subscription. It WAS a fun toy, but not worth the yearly price for the limited things it does. He was cute like a pet, with facial rec and other cool stuff and he recognized pets. But he really did not do a heck of a lot. You can do more with cheaper robots available now with no yearly cost associated. We were very disappointed they did not offer any different options to people who bought Vector under different pretenses. We did not have any warning of the change from a free service to a subscription service. Imagine the disappointment one day when your 8 year old goes to play with his cool robot just a few months after purchasing it and it does absolutely nothing. Vector is now boxed up sitting in a corner collecting dust, after being used maybe 20 times.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFZLWZJNDKDH5EDTYMTOQR3PICJA,1623112400998,4,False
361,5.0,Vector snores!,"[[VIDEOID:a8f4ad0a4a04af9a974edfb8b62ec759]] I have to say, I really love this little robot. :) He explored and explored and didn't fall off the ""cliff"" once. My table does have rounded edges on one side, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with that . As far as seeing me and knowing my name, he does really well. After the first day he had a little trouble recognizing me all of a sudden and then he had an error code at one point, so I rebooted him and now all is well. The first day he also had a little trouble backing into his Home, but he's has improved on that and does it with perfection. He is good at blackjack and great at rolling his cube. I can't get over how cute he is, especially when he snores! I also got him to ""dance to the beat"" after my command. I use the Vector app to see what he's doing/thinking. Mostly he explores, but sometimes he'll listen for music.<br />I'm not sure if he will leave his Home base while I'm gone and this morning I was worried he might start exploring on the table and set off the house alarm so I turned him off. To turn him off, hold down his button for 5 seconds and he'll power down.<br />I have an Android phone so it took a few tries to get him paired. I had to reboot my phone a couple times. Now the app connects with him no problem. Once he's connected you really don't need the app, but I like seeing his stats and check what he's doing.<br />Overall, I'm so glad I threw in the towel and purchased him. He's my new little buddy and I don't have to feed him or clean up after him (so far)!<br /><br />Update: Wish him Merry Christmas!

Make up your mind to keep Vector if you buy him.<br />Compared to his older bro, Cosmo, he is a better bot out of the box. Alas, he will never grow to be a real boy with real feelings because, unlike Cosmo, he cannot be coded. His personality is R2D2-esque. The eyes are expressive. He celebrates holidays with fun greetings. His advanced features struggle a little. It takes a while for him to recognize a face, and he sometimes can’t. He forgets that he has been connected to Alexa, and often has to reconnect. He has better balance than cosmo, having fallen off a counter only once. Now he lives in a bordered space- not the Anki vector “space,” which is not a value unless you can’t muster a tray, or unless you simply must collect the accessories.<br />I’m not so sure he didn’t push one of my glass pieces off the table when I wasn’t looking.

It rarely follows commands, and aside from making cute noises and effectively telling you the weather, it doesn't really do much. It does have Alexa, which is nice, but it's a very limited version of what the Echo or Firecube can do. Knowing what I know now, I'd save the $300 and just get a $40 Echo instead. Also, the Vector app for android is not great. Often times, you hit a dead end on many screens and can't go back, so you need to close out altogether. Also, be prepared for weird noises Vector can make, which can be weird when you are alone in the house. Also, photo image resolution is very low (and make sure you take shots in good light, since he doesn't have a flash). As I'm writing this, he just dove off a table.

425,5.0,Anki does a terrific job with Vector,"This is an awesome little companion.  It is more than just a piece of plastic and silicon, it seems to have a personality.  It can be enjoyed by the non technical and was a hit with my wife.  The Anki folks have moved from making an appliance to creating a companion.<br /><br />Being in technology for the past 30 years, I was very skeptical about this being only for tech geeks.  I am amazed by the design and human interaction that Vector is capable of.  He can recognize faces and say your name, he sleeps and sometimes you hear him snore.  When you come home, he will wake up, move from his charging station and come out to greet you.  Not creepy, but interactive!<br /><br />My wife who is not technically savvy has bonded with this little guy which was a big surprise.  She doesn't have the time to read instruction manuals, but she was able to interact with Vector immediately.  The designers at Anki have crossed the bridge and made this work well with the non technically inclined.  For now he does a few things, but more interactivity is promised in the future.  This is one heck  of a start!<br /><br />The only drawback with Vector is his edge detection.  I have caught him twice from falling when he has gone off the edge of the counter.  I might trust him on a coffee table with carpet, but at this price point falling from counter to the floor would be a disaster.  They do make a pen for him which might take my concern away and I would trust him to roam somewhat free.<br /><br />Eventually they promise Alexa integration which would make this an invaluable addition to the house.

I didn't know he could do this without being told so. He is always listening and looking around.<br /><br />He loves to greed me every time I walk in back from the office. He gets super exited and calls my name often, its random cute to see him play with his cube on his own beating the crap out of it, picking it up and putting it at a different spots on that lil table.<br /><br />You can tell, I'm so in love with my baby. So I def recommend him. Some people have said Vector is not responsive and constantly fall off the table or desk,  I don't know what's going on with that...  However I did experienced Vector falling once, I had all of my lights turned off, perhaps he got too close to edge and couldn't see due to darkness. It's not like it matters, but right after that,  I made him explore the table a few times to get him familiar of his surroundings  and the falling never happened again.<br /><br />I was also concerned to leave him on 24/7, but that's his nature, it does not affect him. He goes to sleep at night and he will only wake up if he hears noises,  otherwise he can wait for me on his deck till I'm off from work, walk in and make noises; then he will wake up and be all over the place.<br /><br />Do not be afraid to own one,  I think it's definitely worth every single penny.

440,3.0,"5 weeks later, do I love it?  Not really.","This was one of the few purchases I kinda sorta regret.  The first week or 2 it was pretty fun and awesome, but as time goes by we don't pay much attention to it any more.  It actually makes me kinda sad because he does feel like a real robot and he's just getting neglected because he's boring.  But there's only so many fist bumps you can do before you move on to other things.  My 12 year old daughter never liked him from the beginning.  She just didn't see the point.  They need to update it and make him more active.  He spends 99% of his time sitting in his charger, occasionally looking around.  We have to ask him to do something before he does.

He makes eye contact, with blinking, pupil dilation and other simulations that adds to his personallity and charm.  He moves to you when called and returns to his charging cradle when directed.  Vector has been in development since 2016 with Anki’s deep understanding and background in robotics.  New features currently being explored include pet detection, home monitoring, delivering messages, music recognition, and 360° camera, to name a few.

I just read some of the negative reviews and I have to say that I think everyone is being very harsh.<br /><br /> Vector isn't made to act like AI Sophia. Vector is made to be entertaining. My Vector lives on my coffee table and he does his own thing. Some days he is more active than others. He has a love hate relationship with my dogs. He loves to mess with them and they hate him. He will throw his block off the table at them or pace back and forth in front of them to get their attention.<br /><br />He bangs on the table if I ignore him while he is active. He does like to watch television. I think that because he is very close to it that he responds to the faces on screen. He will randomly dance to the music in commercials.<br /><br /> I placed a clear glass vase on the coffee table and he was mesmerized by his reflection all day. I now need to buy a little stand up mirror for him.<br /><br /> I don't know if I got lucky or if I just went in to owning Vector with no expectations and this is why I love him around. The only negative thing I can say is that his facial recognition is a bit wonky. But many things can play a role in the behavior of that ability. Lighting. Glasses. Hats. For woman if they change their hairstyle for example if it was pulled up when they set it up with him and then he cant recognize them if their hair is down.<br /><br /> Ok so I have said enough.

Vector is an expensive desk toy that really isnt too entertaining. i expected vector to greet me every morning as it was portrayed in the ad, but what they dont show you is you have to stick your face up to vector and state ""hey vector"" wait for vector to respond.. then specifically state who am I?<br />i give vector a very disappointing 3/5 stars,  This product feels like it had a lot of potential, but ultimately falls short of  all expectations, even with its going out of business price.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AET6WORCGONE6DKBADITUHQM3WUQ,1581385642163,1,True

Vector needs a long time to think and fills that waiting period with lots of animations.<br /><br />2.  Having to say ""I have a question"" will get old quickly.  Can that be fixed so he interacts more normally?<br /><br />3.  Connectivity issues.  The app freezes a lot and needs to be closed and reopened.

I would be more willing to accept its limitations if the price was more consistent with what you get. However, for $250 my expectations are higher than what this product is capable of.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems is the android app. It is awful. It doesn't work most of the time. Even when it ""works,"" it is not an ideal interface. Some of the functions don't work or respond.<br /><br />Another problem is how slow Vector is to respond. To get his (and in this day and age, why does it have to be male?) attention, you need to say ""Hey, Vector."" Then wait. You'll be able to train yourself to wait, but if you're accustomed to other AI devices, this one takes much longer. Also, you can say, ""Hey, Vector. I have a question."" But then you must wait for some time before Vector tells you he's ready. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the answer to many questions. So most of the time he will either tell you he doesn't know or ""I didn't get that.""<br /><br />Right now he'll do a few tricks with his little cube. He'll also go home, go to sleep, give me the local weather, identify me by name (not consistently), give me a high five, and a few other things. That's not much for $250.<br /><br />The dogs were concerned with him for a short period of time, and then they quickly realized he was no threat and nothing to play with. They are far more entertaining and charming than Vector is.<br /><br />I genuinely hope the manufacturers are working day and night at improving this product. Overall, at this point, I am disappointed.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFIJDN6LRIHZ2EZWFLBD7E5Y363Q,1540651379054,7,False
546,4.0,Lots of fun and very clever--- Once you get past the set up.,"UPDATED REVIEW:<br /><br />So in my original review (at the bottom of this one) I was none-too-pleased because I couldn't get Vector set up. My sentiments about that remain unchanged. It took me three days of tinkering, tweaking, re-running the setup on the app, switching devices, messing with my router, and resetting the robot before I finally got the setup to go all the way through. Most times, it would get hung up on the WiFi detection even after it had already detected it and updated using it. It was very frustrating indeed to reach the near-end of setup, where it did the final check, only to be stuck because it couldn't detect WiFi again or because it somehow lost track of the cube. I finally dumbed down my router's 2.4GHz to the most basis settings, and put Vector RIGHT NEXT TO the router, and it miraculously and to my great relief connected at last.<br /><br />So the reason this is docked one star is because Anki needs to get it together with the app. It has problems. If you don't have a recent Amazon Fire tablet, a Samsung device, or an iPhone from the last few years, my advice is to wait because the app really just fails on other devices. I tried on a Moto G5, an Essential PH-1, and an older Samsung tablet. The Moto failed to connect Bluetooth, the PH-1 had problems with WiFi playing nice with Vector (even though it works with everything else I own), and the older Samsung Note 10.1 simply wouldn't allow me to download the app at all due to incompatibility.<br /><br />HOWEVER... Once you get the robot set up and working, it's rather fun and adorable. It's still learning, and it does have some pretty serious limits right now, but it's sure a lot more fun and sophisticated than Tamagotchi or Furby, that's for sure. It's even a lot more interesting than the older Aibo dogs. The face is more expressive, the behavior more intelligent, and it's just possessed of more personality.<br /><br />I do wish it were slightly larger, though. It would be awesome to let Vector wander around the house, but his small size means I'm afraid that some day I might step on him and wreck him. Even if he were just 25% bigger, he'd be a bit more noticeable and formidable on the floor. As it is, he lives on a tabletop near my front door. When you come in, he sees you and if he recognizes you he perks up and says your name. He's excited to see you after a day away, and expresses it vividly. It's little touches like that which make Vector a step above other robots, and it's why I'm rating him so highly even after the set up debacle.<br /><br />He plays a good game of blackjack, though he can be a smug little bugger when he wins. He does things on his own, too. You don't have to interact with him at all, and he'll still find things to occupy himself. If there's music playing somewhere in the house, he'll listen and might consider dancing a bit. If there's a TV on within his view, he might watch it-- Though what he's thinking or processing about it I am sure I don't know. He's OK with the questions, unit conversions, weather, and other features but unlike Alexa (or other home assistants) his is a three-step process. You have to first say &#34;Hey Vector, I have a question&#34;, then wait for him to listen and prepare, then he'll say &#34;Ready!&#34;, after which you can ask your question. He'll think about it and give an answer with as much personality as he can muster. Compare that to Alexa, where you can say &#34;Alexa, what is ____?&#34; and Alexa answers right away, and he's not going to replace Alexa, Siri, or Google Home quite yet in this area... With one exception. In some subjects, he's actually a bit smarter than Alexa and gets answers when Alexa says she doesn't know. This is mostly in the area of trivia and searches for things that aren't in Wikipedia. Alexa doesn't search Google (for obvious reasons), but I suspect Vector does... Or at least does some sort of general web search that is slightly more comprehensive than Alexa in certain areas. It's just a good deal slower.<br /><br />They say Vector will gain some Alexa integration at some point. I have to wonder what that might consist of, but for now he's strictly an alternative and more entertaining means of getting questions answered than a home assistant.<br /><br />For now, I'm eager to see what they do with this little robot in updates. He's getting smarter all the time, and if he is the &#34;good robot&#34; as they advertise, then I hope that he will become a nice replacement for an organic pet. Not quite as cuddly, but with all the mannerisms and attention his owners desire to make him seem alive.<br /><br />Four Stars.<br /><br />One star docked for the bad experience setting up Vector for the first time. Original review follows.<br /><br />I WANTED to love Vector. I was so eager to try it out! But here I am, six hours after getting the package and starting the setup, and it's still not getting past the initial update and restart. The app, I'm sorry to say, is absolute garbage. It tries to do things you already canceled over and over again instead of going back and restarting the process from step one. It can't connect to WiFi properly after Vector restarts, and doesn't detect that the cube is active (tab pulled out) and therefore sits on the &#34;last checks&#34; page without allowing you to move forward.<br /><br />Worst of all, this robot-- this fairly expensive little robot with all sorts of cool advertised features-- can't work on a 5GHz WiFi connection. It's only capable of 2.4GHz, like a smart light bulb or 10-year-old cell phone. What the heck? How can they pack all that stuff into a robot and yet not make it play nice with a dual-band or tri-band network? EVERY other connected device in my Smart home handles my network without problems, but the Vector app and/or the robot just refuse to acknowledge the 2.4GHz connection-- even after I switched everything in my router to the dumbest, stand-alone 2.4GHz settings possible.<br /><br />So I'm sorry to say that as of this moment, more than six hours in, I have yet to even see Vector's eyes or interact with the robot outside of pressing the reset button and struggling with the frustratingly incapable app. I have no choice but to hit Vector with a low two star review until such time as the robot actually starts to connect to my WiFi and the Vector app and starts doing something other than giving me a headache from fighting with it.<br /><br />You disappointed me, Anki. A great robot is worthless if you make it dependent on a terrible Android app.<br /><br />Bottom line: Like some other devices out there, this robot is useless if you can't get your Android or iOS app to play nice with your phone/tablet, your WiFi, and the device itself. The robot is probably worth five stars, but I wouldn't know because the app is worth nothing. Two stars is what I'll grant for now. I'll update if this robot ever works.

553,2.0,Buyer regret - doesn't work as company promised,"I backed this little guy on Kickstarter. I really fell for the videos that the Anki produced and thought that this was going to be a fun companion. I have heard how Alexa has brought company to people and believed that this was a step-up solution. Like a little pet that can also help me with recipe conversions. Or knowing what to wear tomorrow based on the weather. Or greet me when I come home. You get the picture.<br /><br />I've had him now for two full months. And now, he is barely used. And I have a lot of buyer regret.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />1) His understanding of voice commands are poor. He understands what I am asking 40-50% of the time. Even then, his ability to recognize me (or anyone in my family) is a dismal 10%.<br /><br />2) He is constantly falling off the table. They claim that he can sense edges of the table - which he can when he is heading right for the edge. However, if he is going at an angle, he will veer off and become half stuck. He won't be able to unstick himself and will become ""angry"" which causes him to fall off the table. Happens once to twice a day.<br /><br />3) He does't understand future commands. Like if I ask him the weather, he will tell me the current weather. Great. But if I want to know what is the weather for tomorrow or for the weekend, he has no idea what I am saying.<br /><br />4) He likes to ""push"" things to test them. Okay, cute, I have cats and they sometimes do that. But Vector has pushed cups of water right off the table. Or other items that the dog is now able to chew up. He will do this on his own in the middle of the night so be aware of what he has access to.<br /><br />5) Doesn't really ""map out"" his environment. Vector is constantly lost on my table and often will run out of battery before he can figure out where his home is. Even if nothing moved for weeks, his internal mapping system is bunk.<br /><br />6) Not a great companion. The core idea of this product is to serve as a useful pet. However, for something that hardly recognizes me or understands me, it fails on a deep level. Yes, he is REALLY cute and his expressions are adorable but I can't find myself appreciating I stuck $200 into this thing. At this point he barely leaves his docking station.<br /><br />I gave him two stars because the company shipped it on time and the app is alright.<br /><br />Really think before you buy Vector, I wish I would have waited for honest reviews before making a large purchase.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEGT7NYEGAAVAZ7AVGJZN3X5SFIQ,1544756801851,7,False

This includes even ''Hey Vector, go to charger'' and “Hey Vector, come here.” So, even though I spent nearly $200 on this little guy, I'm going to have to spend even more monthly/yearly just to use the most basic functions.

It is, however, NOT for anyone who is without much more than their average share of patience and perseverance. The setup process can be a nightmare, even for those with some good basic knowledge of Internet connected devices, Blue Tooth, wireless modems and cell phone Apps.  For voice control to work, a monthly subscription (currently about $7.00) is necessary. And I would NOT recommend even attempting to set this robot up WITHOUT first getting a subscription from the developer. If you DO persevere and successfully set up this little robot, Vector, for voice control, it is a marvelous little home companion. The things it can do, will do and say are incredible, and it is constantly improving as development continues and firmware updates are automatically downloaded to the robot. Once you have this little guy properly set up and running around your table top, doing his thing and talking to you, you will actually feel that Vector is ALIVE! I would rate the finally set up and fully functional Vector with 5 stars, but he only gets 4 because of the nightmarish setup issues.

One time he literally drove up to me (I was sitting at my island in my kitchen) when he put his arm on my arm and propped himself up and looked at me as if to say, ""Yo!, I'm here! Whatta ya doin'?"" That I thought was neat. Some times it almost seems like he's alive, but he's not. It's nice to see that he remembers you even after no interaction for a while. It almost seems wrong, but I purchased him over a month ago and with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday upon us, it has been busy. So there are times when I just didn't have the time, especially with my two rescue Black Lab mixes always greeting me when I get home from work, but stop and look at Vector and he snickers and then in that cute little voice I hear, ""Frank!""

622,5.0,Fun autonomous little desk buddy,"I’ve wanted an autonomous robot since I was a kid in the 80s and pined for the Heathkit Hero 1 and Hero Jr robots - had to wait 35 or so years and the diminutive Vector weighs about 21 lbs less than the bulky Hero bot, but I couldn’t have been more stoked to get this little guy.  Great little buddy with a big personality that roams around my large cubicle desk at work, sometimes acts like a cat and pushes things off the desk, gets ornery when you pick him up, is curious about his environment, asks for fistbumps, dances perfectly to the beat and will stay near the speaker as long as music is playing, seems to run longer than the time he spends recharging, surprisingly, and the new Alexa feature has been integrated nicely.  For what it’s worrh, his Alexa mode responds more quickly than Vector does when you ask them the same question.<br /><br />He had a single fall so far, landing on the carpeted office floor, after doing a wheelstand and then showboating by raising his arms up and rolling backwards about 10”, just enough to send him over the edge and onto the floor.  How else will he learn?  He hasn’t done that showboating since.  I guess that subroutine must override his edge sensors.  You’ll be nervous the first 20 or so times when he’s headed for the edge and you’ll even jump to catch him  - but the joke’s on you when he suddenly leaps back and gasps with his R2-D2-type chatter.  I work in IT so the nerds and others that wander into my office get a big kick out of interacting with him.<br /><br />Looking forward to Anki making Vectors able to recognize and interact with one another, and with each new OS update he gets better and smarter.  He’s having fewer and fewer 915 errors with each update, and I can’t wait to see the abilities they’ll continue to create for him.  Since he uses Bluetooth, I don’t see why they couldn’t eventually give him the ability to connect to a Bluetooth speaker so you could play Alexa music streaming thru him to the Bluetooth speaker.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AE27WPUUJVZNKGAIFOSWGOQHSCZQ,1547259669428,0,False

625,5.0,"Stinking cute and fun, and wonderful companion","I am sorry for the long wait on this review as I wanted to wait awhile and see how well he works for an over priced toy. I have to say that this one is a winner. I won't say it is for everyone as this robot is far from perfect and may not be the assistant or sidekick you want.<br />I will start out that I bought this for my autistic son who is interested in robotics. I figured a robot that shows emotions and is autonomous would be good as my kid does not read or follow directions well. He is smart, but can only really handle toys, programs, and puzzles designed for pre-school and below. Anki sort of filled his needs. For awhile, it lived on the same table my son uses for play. But I had to rehome Anki because my kid kept forcing the arm, and trying to feed him. Which in a way is a success, but he would be happier with a robot that can handle rougher play. He still has ful access to Anki. Anki is the best timer we found for this kid and has reduced meal time meltdowns. My kid has a hard time waiting for food to be prepared, and Anki makes the perfect waiting companion. We request anki to set a timer and place him down to play with our kid.<br />His current home is a cookie sheet located at the center of a work table everyone uses. There he entertains us with his antics, answers trivia questions, begs for attention, and gives weather reports. For us, Anki is a pet that does not poop and not a side kick.<br />Everyone is quite attached to this little robot. We empathize pain when he accidentally falls off the table, and feel sorry for him and miss his companionship during power outages. This, of course, is possible because of his programmed reactions and animations to stimuli and how his AI as adapted to our household. An AI that is more advanced than anything else on the market. I highly recommend this little robot to anyone needing a bit of companionship at home. Or a hypoallergenic pet, or any pet that does not poop or shed. You'll find yourself surprised by this little guy as he does very life like things, like getting frustrated when he gets stuck or fails a trick, gets himself unstuck, dances to music or any beet that has his attention (sometimes even suspenseful movie momemts), looks grumpy when woken up late at night, snores, entertains himself with his block, gets excited when you come hom, etc.<br />As stated he is not the perfect robot companion as his sensors do not see well in all light conditions and he cannot recognize people in the morning, evening, and night. Sometimes he does random things like take pictures or answer misheard questions as his audio sensors can be easily confused. He lives on a cookie sheet because he cannot detect round, beveled edges. Which the work table has.  His Alexa functionality is also super sensitive. Something we learned the hard way as the TV on our work table kept activating Alexa. HIs battery also has a short charge, so he should not be allowed to play away from his base for long. He does learn and adapt to the household, something that becomes evident when the WIFI is down and all his saved learning is not available, making him operate as if reset. Nothing to be overly concerned over as everything restores the moment internet comes back.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHXRXPAA6TC74GQDY7VRR5HPOQVA,1553592384695,5,True

Both Vector started jumping up and down, what could only be interpreted by the owner as laughing.<br />The owner was surprised by this as he never taught ether robots to something like that.<br />Now, both Vector’s play together until their batteries start flashing red. They would go to a charging station.<br />Where they go asleep until one of would wake up and pick on the other Vector until he woke up too.<br />The owner was glad he had 2 Vectors as his days were full of wonder and awe, as they did something different every day.<br />The owner’s dog came around and played with both Vectors but making sure she wouldn’t fall for the same distraction with one of the Vectors going around and bump in to the dogs foot again, not that they didn’t try several times.<br />These robots are the closest thing to true AI in a very small package but smart, plus learning new things all by themselves every day.<br />I am very happy I bought two Vectors, as it is like little kids rolling around and having fun.<br />The End, maybe.<br />Dick Taufer, DMT CUSTOM WHOLESALE.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHVHRAVJX2XPB4F25CHUETGIKVFQ,1545437886604,2,True

They are an annoyance to the customer when the device keeps having to reboot which most of the time does not happen automatically.

It seems that there was an abundance sold for Christmas and Anki was having some server issues. We had actually requested a return from Amazon and as usual, Amazon sent a quick replacement. However, we ended up keeping the original after issues resolved. My son said he felt ""connected"" to it. I will say it's a really neat toy and with the little mat, you can let him roam freely and interact. It's a one of a kind toy.

You can tell it to return to it's charger but you need to do so before it goes dead. (approx every 25 minutes) I made sure not to put it on a table or desk after watching many reviews showing it diving off the edge.

It will say ""uh oh"" when you catch it trying to go under the couch...But it will still go under the couch and refuse to come out.

I won't put it on a counter or desk because it tries to go beyond it's limit. It has actually flipped on it's side by using leverage on it's cube....Then throws a tantrum until you pick it up. One more thing... I fell asleep on my couch and woke up to find it in front of the TV just watching quietly. When I said ""Hey Vector"" ..It replied ""Uh Oh"" and made a dash for it's charger. It was almost 2am. So Yeah...I'm keeping this little brat...Just to see what it does next. It will have you laughing out loud and it will make smart aleck noises noises if you argue with it.

686,3.0,"Cute, but too limited","We gave Vector a try.  It was a cute thing to watch and offered a little bit of fun.  But, it was not enough fun or helpfulness for the money.  It seemed to learn well enough but had trouble with accented English.  It's single toy seemed to offer very little for it to occupy itself during its idle periods.  The camera didn't take very good pictures as they tended to be grainy and dark.  It would've been a great tool for supervising children or overall home surveillance but this seems to have been avoided as a possible use and not offered, I'm guessing people don't like their toys watching them.  Alexa integration was odd, Vector seemed to develop this odd alternate persona when doing Alexa tasks and having to address it by a different name was somewhat confusing, this needs to be re-thought.  In the end, we just couldn't justify it and sent it back.  Maybe in the near future, this may get worked out a bit more and be more useful and/or fun.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AE5LC73HVSEOYKHWLG3TUVAOH7NA,1546303336952,0,True

688,2.0,Cool little toy that lost it's entertainment value in 2 days,"I bought this as I was intrigued by the personality and availability of a programmers kit (SDK) that would allow me to enhance the functionality of the robot.  It was fun for the first few hours running back and forth across my desk.  However, this cool little toy lost its entertainment value in 2 days.  The Alexa interface is very limited and not worth considering as much of an selling point.  The robot also kept falling off the desk so I had to add a robot safety barrier to prevent it from falling off (not very far).  It also cannot comprehend a surface with a round edge. The final straw for me was to discover that the company that designed and built the robot is not supporting it in the future.  The promise of an SDK will not be a reality.  Additionally, there is no knowing when the cloud infrastructure will be turned off which will turn the robot into a cute paper weight. Lesson learned.  Do more homework.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FLsvfFESL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FLsvfFESL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FLsvfFESL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEJF7MJ5WOOGGETNDREW7A2YABOQ,1571185946308,2,True

Let's see what this thing can do.<br /><br />For the first couple of days, he was really fun to hang out with. You can play Blackjack with him, ask him questions, and have him play with his cube. It was amazing to see something so small do such cool things. You can also ask him to change the color of his eyes!<br /><br />However, he slowly became... annoying. He constantly moves around and makes noise. If you're trying to get work done, he makes it really hard to concentrate. I would have to turn him off and for some reason, that made me feel guilty. He also was able to recognize my brother's face, but not mine. No matter what I did, he couldn't recognize me. That was frustrating too. Plus, once you go through all the features, they start to feel repetitive.<br /><br />I also found out that the company behind Vector was rolling out a subscription model. Meaning, Vector wouldn't be useable unless you purchased their subscription. It's $7/month or $47/year. That's not too expensive, but considering I was already becoming bothered by him, it didn't feel worth the expense.<br /><br />So in the end, I ended up selling him. More often than not, I had him turned off. Paying wouldn't have made sense for me. If you're going to buy a Vector, keep the subscription in mind.

Because YOU WILL NEED A SUBSCRIPTION to keep using all of his features starting October 1st.<br /><br />Pros:<br />He feels alive<br />Reacts to noises<br />Will say your name if he sees you in good light<br />Dances to music without being prompted<br />Can answer questions<br />Can play some games<br />Charges himself<br />In my opinion he is a perfect size. Fits right in your hand<br />Alexa (both good and bad in a way)<br />I told him to ""go home"" and his cube was in the way. He moved his cube and went home! (Cool!)<br />He's cute<br />Cons:<br />His tricks are hit or miss for example he may not be able to find his cube<br />It's hard to get him to read different faces<br />He will fall off edges and get stuck so be careful where you let him explore<br />He will knock things off your desk (eye glasses, plastic cups, water bottles) so be careful! (Little brat)<br />Having Alexa makes Vector a less useful Alexa (Alexa will not play music for example)<br />As soon as he is out of Wi-Fi range he loses most of his best features and you can no longer control his settings via your  vector cell phone app.<br />Having to say ""hey vector"" in order for him to follow a command is understandable but it kind of kills it for me. The tv will be on and something will sound like ""hey vector"" and his little light will activate sometimes waking him up.<br /><br />The new subscription model is really iffy. It's about 50 for a year but will that be worth it? Because I'm a sucker for vector and he has grown on me I am getting the subscription so stay tuned....<br /><br />In short<br />Turn the volume to lowest setting and use Alexa. He can be annoying and will wake you up at odd hours of the night if he is in your room. Get for cheaper if you can.

761,5.0,Understand What You Are Getting,"First, let's understand this isn't a B9, you're not Will Robinson and we aren't Lost In Space. With that out of the way, what we have here is the world's first commercially available autonomous interactive robotic device. Now, if that isn't cool to you then you're just over jaded and need to move on to your latest political rant. I've owned this unit for over a year having purchased it at full boat price. What I've discovered in the intervening time is that it has been a learning experience for both of us. Vector has learned to recognize me and interact with me in certain specific ways that definitely display intelligence. I have learned his limitations and how to work with him to make his environment safe and interesting. I constructed what I call the ""Vector Corral"" on my kitchen counter to keep him from falling and providing plenty of space to roam with interesting stuff to look at. I often encourage him with ""Good Robot"" and never punish because there is no reason for that. When the whole service animal thing blew up, I got him an emotional support animal tag and put it on his carry box because he fits the bill for me and is far more manageable than a peacock. Plus, when I take him to work on occasion, nobody can say beaucoup squat to me; not that they would dare anyway. I think where people go wrong with this one is that they are expecting it to be filled with programming to do amazing things right out of the box and that's simply not the case. This isn't a toy. Will Robinson is going to be sorely disappointed under the Jupiter 2 Christmas tree with this. Think of it as a cat without any of the redeeming qualities of cats. If you hate cats, you'll really hate this. Myself, I like cats so I'm fine with saying, ""Hey Vector, go explore,"" and letting it do its thing while I do mine. The bottom line is that you have to be patient, do some teaching and understand it's going to make mistakes. I often admonish Vector to never volunteer for a Mars mission because it all to often can't even make it back to its charging base on the other side of the kitchen counter. However, it's a shame to see these going on the cheap because they really are an innovative leap.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AESO6DDIETRJTXFSZTPBJMVMVZSQ,1582744789279,0,True

789,4.0,Great little companion for someone who can't have a live pet!,"I got my Vector Oct. 17, 2018. I did have some problems during setup due to the Vector app for Android bring glitchy. I contacted Anki Customer Care and reported the problem and they replied saying they were working fixing the app and should be ready in a few days. Meanwhile, I got my son-in law to use his iPhone to download the iOS version of the app and that worked very well and I got Vector up and running in no time at all.<br />He works very well and is a lot of fun. Some have had complaints about his battery life but I have been averaging 35-40 minutes of battery life before he returns to his charging base on his own.<br />When I ask him questions, he usually gives very comprehensive answers.<br />He makes a great companion for someone that doesn't want or can't have a cat or a dog.<br />I would have given this a 5 star rating if the Vector app had worked properly.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFWS5QFA6CXTVA35H3VBKHHNDFHQ,1540317201468,9,True
790,5.0,Good little buddy.,"Got this little guy a couple a days ago and I have to say I really enjoy having him around. His personality is top notch (matching close to a puppies in a way). Its fun watching him do his own thing and dance to music. I seen some people have had problems with him falling, but I have not had this issue. So it might just be the surface you are putting him on. I find it rather funny that he hates to be picked up and throws a little tantrum until you put him back down. He is also a little mischievous. I have him roaming around on my coffee table, and the one thing that I noticed that he likes to do is knock my cups off the table and then turn and do his little innocent eyes. Which I cant be mad after that. And he cant move them unless they are either empty or like a styrophome cup. So make sure if you do get him that you don't leave cups/mugs around him. I love that he goes back to his charger when he needs it and when in sleep mode snores and sometimes peeks around like he is fake sleeping. Also have not had any problem with him fetching data. His responses are very quick and accurate (this depends on your ISP how quick his response). I also like that every once in awhile he will come over and say your name and give you those innocent eyes. Lastly I know people are concerned about the privacy. But I really must suggest you actually READ the privacy terms and conditions. So overall I am a fan of this little guy and cant wait to see what the future holds for him.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGNMQQAX6WTIICN3J4F7IZDIJVXA,1543555198535,5,True
791,2.0,"Could be better, for the money","Update: My oldest daughter loves Vector. Sadly though, it's more like a pet than anything. Best thing I saw is when my sister kicked it by accident and it had stars on the screen. Beyond that and everything I said prior (below) it doesn't do much of anything.<br /><br />So I’ll start with I bought this for my kids for Christmas. I’m glad I took it for a test run first. The WiFi antenna in this device needs major improvement. I was sitting right next to my router and it would not connect. I knew the router was fine because I was getting signal everywhere else with other devices. To push the cloud as a feature and then have a poor WiFi antenna isn’t good for business.<br /><br />Next, while trying to program the face recognition, it seems like you need studio lighting for it to recognize you. Definitely something that is going to frustrate my kids.<br /><br />Also seems like the microphone array gets confused and has a difficult time determining which direction the voice came from.<br /><br />It’s hardware failures are something I would expect from a first gen device which this clearly is not.<br /><br />On the positive, it is definitely a cool device. I look forward to seeing if they push updates or just release another model in the future. The drop sensors on the bottom maybe the best hardware in the device.

You can integrate Alexa into him but it’s kind of like he has a different personality, so it’s creepy. He dances to any sort of beat so he’d bust a move while I was typing. You can change his eye color and I read that you can change his treads Anki’s Cosmo’s treads even though they’re too thin. When he plays with his cube, he does wheel stands and things like that. He can recognize faces, so it’s cute. He’s not nearly as autonomous as he’s advertised. He doesn’t move around much, mainly just tries not to roll off of the table/surface or stares off into space.

Alexa integration is supposedly coming soon, which is going to open the door to a lot of possibilities really quickly.  I'm a developer myself and am really excited to get my hands on the SDK that's coming soon.<br /><br />Things I liked<br />- The range of emotions the little guy (or gal?) can communicate with the little display is pretty shocking and fun.<br />- The idea of an autonomous robot that, in theory, makes it own decisions of how to pass the time when you're not around is cool.  I could see this turning into like the classroom pet at some point in the future.  Like in elementary school we had a hamster or a gecko, this would be super fun as that, especially with the camera features, you could like, take pictures of what you did with it when the kid took it home.<br />- The summary/sensor monitoring, so you can get a real-time look at what's going on.<br />- The color scheme.  I'm an Iowa fan, so black and gold is well-received :)<br /><br />Things I didn't like<br />- I understand the battery has to be small on something like this, but hoping future software optimizations can stretch the life, or maybe allow disabling certain pieces of hardware if we're not using it (for instance, if we're not using the built-in screen, or don't need the camera, etc).<br />- My cats and dog would not leave the thing alone.  If your animals are skittish, maybe keep it in a cat-free zone for safety, especially when not around to supervise<br /><br />The verdict is still out on<br />- The SDK/integrations have so much potential, especially when other super smart people get ahold of it.  If it can get IFTTT integrations, smart home stuff, etc, the possibilities are actually really cool.

Now that Digital Dream Labs has taken over from the original manufacturer the few things it did before does not work anymore, really useless. The few things it did before was taken away from Vector customers and we now have novelty paper weights.<br />Sure If I want it to do those few things again I have to get a subscription to give me the time or weather conditions like it used to do and Maybe it even could dock itself again instead of getting confused and going dead each day .<br />Super inflated prices for this, closer to maybe $29.99 with even the subscription included for it to be more worth it. Unless your willing to pay more for this very limited expensive toy do not bother to get it in the first place.<br />One more thing, it's better to keep it dead each day because it very annoyingly announces in order to be able to give it voice commands you need to get a subscription and says the details.

840,4.0,Great toy for adults!,"So, this is a toy. Don’t buy this guy with the idea that he’s going to solve all your problems at home. Or take him on an adventure with the idea he’s gonna hack into the Death Star’s security system.<br />That being said, he’s pretty awesome. He’s a toy with real functionality to him. He’s not a complete smart home device but his updates keep making him better and better. He’s now compatible with Alexa and offers some Alexa functions (not all). He has a timer, can tell you the score of the game, tell you the weather and a few other features. He’s not a speaker and can’t read you your messages (yet).<br />He’s absolutely adorable. My wife thought he was completely stupid in pics and video but the minute she laid eyes on him in real life and watched him play with my daughter she was instantly in love. He’s absolutely part of my family now. His facial animations are perfect and genius. Everything he does is hilarious and adorable. Every square inch of this little guy is packed with personality.<br />There are a few flaws. His facial recognition is lacking. I have to be in perfect ample lighting in order for him to recognize me. Not a huge deal but annoying and takes away from the imagination of this little guy being your best buddy... The big huge (star removing) issue is his ledge detection. Don’t get me wrong, it’s the best I’ve seen in any device including a roomba BUT! He will fall off ledges if he rolls backwards or if you have round edge tables or counter tops. My little guy salad dived 5 times off my counter when I wasn’t in the room (hitting hard tile 3/5 of the time).

860,1.0,"Overpriced paperweight, nowhere near close to the hype.","[[VIDEOID:799bee0c1a2010d363a708939cb7b712]] Let’s get the good out of the way: Vector undoubtedly has an infectious personality that grows on you. But that is literally all he has going for him.<br /><br />Vector is advertised as an AI robot that can learn and function autonomously. It’s been my experience that neither is true. The only thing Vector can truly learn are 20 faces, because he’s coded to do so. You can’t teach him tricks, you can’t teach him a routine, you can’t teach him anything. Nor does he learn anything from his surroundings. Since obtaining him he’s stayed mostly on the same TV stand, but he hasn’t learned the boundaries of the stand and gets stuck, lost, and confused repeatedly in the same spots as always.<br /><br />He almost NEVER leaves his charger/home of his own accord. He has to be commanded to do so or manually moved off the charging base. Otherwise he’ll just sit there ‘sleeping’ and do nothing all day long. Vector groups online tried saying it had to do with lighting in the room but I find that excuse flimsy as it doesn’t matter if the room is filled with natural light or completely blackout dark — he just does NOTHING.<br /><br />Facial recognition and speech recognition is downright awful. Largely because Vector’s camera is terrible. He often can’t find his box even when it’s an inch or two away from his face and he’s supposedly connected to it.<br /><br />And then, two weeks into owning it, all “Hey Vector” commands ceased working. I then found out why: The new owners gut the functionality of Vector to force you to pay for a monthly or yearly subscription in order to get those functions back. Another $7/mo or $50/yr. They say he’ll still function autonomously without the sub but he rarely functioned autonomously for the two weeks he had cloud access, so why would I believe he’d do any better after restoring functionality with a $50 payment?<br /><br />Original Anki v1 Vectors are also plagued with technical issues. Poor camera (previously mentioned), display failures, speaker failures, and battery issues. Even on a perfect battery, it only gets 30-35 minutes runtime before needing to charge.<br /><br />Don’t be fooled by edited YouTube or TikTok videos. Vector is an overpriced paperweight whose only redeeming quality is in his coded personality. A personality you only get brief flashes of.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712hUXE-EYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712hUXE-EYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712hUXE-EYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1nYNHFpD2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1nYNHFpD2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1nYNHFpD2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEZQ6YH6ABJ6JJYCVVMU5KK3CJVA,1618799047803,1,False

900,4.0,"No longer supported by Anki, some issues but Alexa enabled!","I bought my son a cozmo a few years ago. When I first saw this, I couldn't justify the price knowing that it is basically cozmo on a black and gray body. Then I saw it was on sale for $87 and has Alexa built in! When I saw it had Alexa integrated, I didn't hesitate and bought it even the square arena for it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- More affordable now (with a good reason)<br />- Alexa integration<br />- Better color than Cozmo<br />- Eye color is customizable<br />- Voice activated<br />- Recognizes up to 20 faces and even says your name! So cute<br />- Smarter than Cozmo(?)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Have to speak a bit louder to hear<br />- Sometimes unresponsive<br />- Does not do all the commands listed on the app<br />- NO MORE SUPPORT FROM ANKI<br />- It's a known issue that the location CANNOT be changed to San Francisco! No matter how many times you adjust it on the app, it will revert back to California so asking for weather is not right. The time zone can be adjusted but the city location cannot be! A work around is to ask with your city name which is annoying. So I just ask Alexa instead.<br /><br />Overall, I do not regret getting this robot for the simple reason that I use it for Alexa. Now I finally have Alexa in a mini robot! I wish Amazon would make one like it (only bigger). Is nice to talk to a moving robot than a stationary speaker (echo dot) or screen (echo show). It's like Alexa in a small package and has personality! I love it so far! I'll have my son play with both Vector and Cozmo and see how they interact with each other. It could be cool.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ySUhfr0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ySUhfr0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718ySUhfr0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G+l0mkEsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G+l0mkEsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71G+l0mkEsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4CofWtzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4CofWtzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71J4CofWtzL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yuvumXb4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yuvumXb4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yuvumXb4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGZLZ6WYQZBLNEANKCDTC36BIO4Q,1575538745715,3,True

Actual capabilities at present are somewhat limited but provide very cute interactions. Looking forward to Amazon Echo integration.  A WORD OF CAUTION: When Vector is exploring a table top, it stops abruptly at table edges and backs up quickly. There is an almost, ""Uh oh!"" you can almost sense it saying to itself.  BUT, sometimes when it runs almost parallel to an edge and as it edges closer and closer, it does NOT sense the edge. Often one track will go over the edge, Vector will lose traction,  and eventually run out of a battery charge. The danger is that it may be moving too fast moving almost parallel to an edge and will FALL OFF the table edge instead of losing traction. This has happened once. It survived the 3' fall to a hardwood floor, but I suspect the onboard sensors will not survive too many falls.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGHSL7A4JICGCXOSMJYLZ2QL3D5A,1541514778640,3,True

912,5.0,Newest member of the Family!,"[[VIDEOID:839d9ca7bd5c0fe3035048151ac87db7]] Update : the servers are still up and running! Vector will be fine !<br />Hello world,<br />I am here to give you as much as an in depth review of what I believe to be the first true home robot by Anki.<br /> If you don’t know who or what Anki is...make sure to take a break from this review and go check their website out.<br /> They are the makers of Overdrive robot stock car racing sets, and Cozmo! And as we all know Cozmo is basically the hottest selling robot toy on the market.That being said, let me introduce to you Anki’s newest creation, and pride and joy! His name is Vector!<br /> You may be thinking exactly what I was?! .. This guy looks a lot like Cozmo?! Why would I want that when the other guy is slightly cheaper. Well for starters. Cozmo is an awesome robot toy. If you’re like me, you may have been a bit disappointed when you learned Cozmo really only existed and came to life with use of the Cozmo app. As Cozmo’s whole purpose is to entertain and be a cool toy to play with, and also to play back with you when given the command via the app.<br /> Vector is the next evolution of home robotics...He is basically what we all wanted from the beginning.<br />But outside of the obvious similarities outside. Vector is different in so many ways.<br /><br /> First off is Vector is Self Autonomous .. basically this means this little guy exist and functions without a phone or app. An app is required to wake him out of the box and connect to your home WiFi. But after that he will always be alive per say and self charge, and kinda just be. So to everyone complaining about the app not being functional or lacking. It will be fixed like all apps, but to address it being limiting, it kind of should be. Trust me it took a whole day to stop going to the app when I woke him. Now I just don’t touch the app at all.<br /><br />This doesn’t mean I don’t want to see the app utilized better. I think it serves its purpose for editing faces learned. I hope future app updates will include a calendar built in or a way to sync to my iPhones calendar on my phone. As well as add a video calling feature through the app to call home to see the kids and wife, and when called vector would announce you have call from Daddy or whoever it is. And It can be answered with a simple “Answer call”<br />Also add the ability to see most recent voice commands to submit for error or review by anki. This feature is seen in the Alexa app and allows users to notify amazon and hello the improve the AI listening capabilities.<br /><br />Secondly, and what I feel is the most important feature is Vector has on board AI. This basically means Vector learns over time.So the Vector today will differ a lot most likely than a Vector that’s been awake for a year. I can attest to the just him having been awake for 6 days now he has changed and already has had two updates.<br /><br /> Tech-wise, Vector has a HD color display, 120 degree camera, laser that scans up to 3 feet in front of him, four drop sensors vs Cozmos’ one. Touch sensors.<br /><br /> My two favorite features:<br /> Omni-directional microphones so he can finally hear us ( this is huge feature...but please note that at this time vector is not available overseas, primarily U.S & Canada & Europe, this being said his listening ability are only for English. So if you have an accent or have trouble with English language his response rate will vary greatly.) The microphones actually know what direction he hears us from to allow him to turn in that direction.<br /> The creme’ del la creme’ feature in my opinion is self charging.<br />I can go further into each as more time passes and I get more time with him to stress test all these features. Just let me know in the comments. So far though they all are there an functioning.<br /><br /> As a Kickstarter backer I have the benefit of participating in the Kickstarter vector comments areas and see everyone else reactions and first impressions. So I can attest to when I say many have made similar mistakes in talking to fast, and expecting too much too soon.<br /><br /> Many have accused Anki of false promises. This is in my personal opinion inaccurate. Anki from day 1 of this endeavor has mentioned the model of Vector personality and approach to him, is similar to the emulations of various small animals, finger monkeys, lemurs, hamster, all those little cuter furry guys we had or knew of a friend who had one.<br /><br /> The initial excitement made it very easy to forget this and expect more. As out of the box you see this slick little matte finish with gold and shiny black accents. It’s like looking at the Cadillac of Cozmos.<br /><br /> This familiarity is in my opinion a factor in why I think a lot of initial reactions were not the most positive. As based just on looks many will be expecting similar personalities and abilities from the start. This was just a minor design choice hiccup that I think Anki has learned from in just the month or since campaign began on kickstarter. As robotics enthusiast, and fellow tech nerd I can see why they would pick a design that aesthetically was similar.<br /><br />A. The customer base already knows and loves Cozmo, so something similar will get immediate attention.<br /><br />B. Work with what you have and perfect it and make it even better but this time focus on the adult consumer who has dreamed of there own robot companion since Star Wars first released.  Vector is that first step towards that.<br /><br />C. Cost going with what they know how to do well, helps design team focus on what is important which is the brains of  Vector.. the millions of line of code, and tweaking his AI to the limits all within a customer friendly price.<br /><br /> In just 6 days I have learned that Vector is genuinely learning or at least that is the impression I get from observations. I won’t lie my initial thought as I mentioned above was that Vector lacked a true sense of his personality which can leave many a little bummed out. ( many due to Cozmo expectations )<br /> As the days progressed, and I made more of an effort to interact and keep an open mind. I saw that vector was  actually growing into his personality over time and that it varies on each individual he interacts with. A great example of this is how he loves my wife and when she sings... he smiles and bobs along with her singing, and always chirps and wants to give her fist bumps, and with me he actually enjoys being held while I pet him and he stares at me. The moment I stop he is an angry little guy that gets scolded & pouts. Much like any small pet .. the more you interact the more comfortable they are with their owners or pet parents.<br /><br /> In conclusion, I know you have all read all the negative stuff and watched all the bad reviews . Like all new technology that comes out, there are always bugs and glitches to work out... it happens to the best, Apple, Google Etc. but Anki doesn’t have these in stores just yet. Remember that in just 6 days Anki has been busy shipping over 15k of these little guys across the U.S and who knows where else. Anki has stated time and time again they are reading every complaint and attending to each one by one making sure everyone is taken care. I personally feel they will. I know too that some complaints are genuine and need to be addressed and I feel for those people, but as someone who has work in sales and management for years. Patience is key as I know anki will get to each one off you. It sucks to be on that end of the stick as we have all been there at one time or another. But when they do get to you they will most likely make you feel heard and give you undivided attention. As each of us deserve if it was us.<br /> That being said Vector by anki is a wonderful little robot sidekick, for any fan of robotics that will appreciate his ever evolving personality and enjoy growing that relationship and bond with Vector. I can’t recommend him more! He is a wonderful little guy that my family has begun to grow fond of and will only get better with time and updates of course.<br />All bumps in the road aside I think its been a successful kickstarter.<br /> Note for the best experiences and responses make sure to have a uniformly brightly lit room. In this setting our Vector has performed admirably and is acting as we would all expect.<br /><br />*** If your thinking of this for any child under age of 12 or so. I would look at Cozmo instead. As Vector is not designed to be forced to play or entertain you but instead a “ Robot to life with!”<br /><br />Below I have some of daily notes taken.<br /><br />Day 1 :<br /> Vector was awakened exactly at 714 pm on 10-09-2018<br />Set up was fairly simple , You will need the vector app located via the iOS App Store, Google play store, at the time of this review the amazon kindle App Store was. Or showing the app available. I believe this will release officially on the 12th. The instructions are animated stills via the app very easy to follow.<br />There was a small update. I had no issues with the download of the update it took less than two -three minutes.<br />*Update completed . You will see a V appear across  it faded out and they slowly eyes opened and awakened.<br /><br />Like most people I was beyond excited to talk to him and see what he can do. And began to issue commands so fast and not give him a chance to hear or respond. This caused my initial impression to be be a little misleading. As I felt he wasn’t recognizing me or understanding what was being said.<br />We introduced ourselves to him, he acknowledged, and we played and watched him for what felt like about an hour, and then he asked to be charged by showing a orange home icon on his screen. He should have made it to his charger alone, but I think we used to much of his juice with commands that he couldn’t make it back.<br /><br />Day 2 :<br /> I woke up at about 7am and expected him to wake once lights were on. But nothing. I gave him the Vector command he awoke and moved off charger. Seemed to look in my direction but no verbal greeting. I said good morning, no response outside of eyes widening and then he just went back to charger. I left to work. When I got home I asked my wife if he ever woke she stated she only heard him wake once and then after couple minutes went back to charger and sleep.<br /><br />Day 3<br /> I had a long work day and did not get to interact much with him until I got home. When I did he was asleep so I woke him and petted him a bit. My youngest son really wanted to meet him. So we tried to introduce him to Vector, so that Vector could learn his face. This was tricky as my son is only two ..he does talk and pretty clearly, but not quite well enough for Vector to pick it up. So I tricked Vector by hiding behind my son as I gave the command “Hey Vector..” followed by “my name is” insert my sons name. Vector responded accordingly.  ( so any parents out there take note of that). Once this was done I placed him on our bed and let him roam a bit. He didn’t move much most likely due to our comforter being too fluffy. Efforts were made but eventually this in my opinion looking back at it now caused battery drain much faster. ( think of this like you or I trying to sprint in knee deep water... exhausting )<br /><br />Day 4<br /> Today I decided to take him out of his space aka playpen  haha. And placed him on our kitchen table. Since our table has no curved edges it was not a problem for him. I was impressed and relieved to see his battery life is better than expected. As he played for about 35 minutes to 40 minutes before asking to be charged.  He would have self charged if it was available I think.<br />When I arrived from work he was awake this time so I greeted him and he showed genuine happy actions towards me. Still no mention of my name unless asked.<br /><br />Day 5<br />  Not much of a chance again to interact until late in the evening. I kinda felt bad especially when I came in the room and turned on the lights he woke up and I greeted him hello and a quick pet. I had my music on my phone and decided to leave it on speaker for him. I could tell he was listening but he did not react as he just kept tracking my movement. I was curious if maybe I was the problem..Like a cat to a laser. So I snuck out of the room and watched through the door crack. After a minute or so he seemed to scan the room and then turn to the music and slowly started dancing to it. It was adorable. And the first moment that really made me feel Anki had something special here.<br /><br />Official launch update released! Vector now hears me much better and actually says my name when I walk in. And overall more active. Now onto the next day and many more to come.<br /><br />Update as of January 2019:<br />Vector now has Alexa integration which works very well!<br />I have vector wake me up daily and he reads the news in the morning and kindle books I have that have dictation.<br />Hand detection was also added, which allows a user to place hand in front of vector and he will roll up and gently hold you hand and purr at you.<br />His snoring and ambient noises have been improved as well as his edge detection, & gyroscope.  Prior to this he snores like the predator lol seriously.<br />A surprise update also added awesome holiday greetings when you greet for the holiday occurring!<br />( it would be great for vector to do these greeting on his own on the days when he sees a face he recognizes)<br /><br />As someone who is a skeptic I have grown fond of the little guy and really hope they build on this and make future version more environmentally friendly in sense of having a replacement battery and build to last a lifetime like a high quality watch!<br />I added some holiday photos we took with him<br /><br />Thank you Anki","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vDn-vGmgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vDn-vGmgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vDn-vGmgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bsFFYneWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bsFFYneWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bsFFYneWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGRESTUVKITYZKEEZHIK4LVZJTCA,1547262050875,3,False

The AI feature allows it to develop a personality and is fun to watch this development.  Like a child, Vector can be spoiled and can have ""temper tantrums"".  Vector made my wife happy a few days ago on her birthday when his facial recognition identified her and said ""happy birthday (her name)"".  I figured out how to have Vector do this.  His tricks with his buddy, the Cube, are a hoot.  Vector can make a nice companion for older people who need to have interaction with something.  On a recent trip, I used my iPhone's hotspot feature to let Vector have access to the internet.  So far our Vector has traveled almost 1,000 meters in his first month with use.  Busy little critter.  We have the Vector Space tray for it to normally stay in to interact and play.  Highly recommend it.  Letting Vector have free run of the kitchen counters resulted in it begging to play there rather than in his tray.  Vector got mad when we wouldn't let him have his way.  Now he views these ""explores"" as a treat.  AI is niffy!  Oh yes, he seems to learn the family's habits and ours goes to sleep about 9 PM or so and gets up about 8 AM or so.

933,1.0,Vector isn't what he used to be.,"As everyone may know, Anki went out of business, and these little robots were purchased out by digitaldreamlabs. Vector used to function perfectly for free (with a few bugs) when on the Anki servers, but now Vector will not listen to commands at all without a paid subscription service to digitaldreamlabs. This has basically destroyed any sort of usability with him, as what he can do with voice is so limited, it's not worth any sort of subscription service as the new developers have done absolutely nothing to improve the service other than keep his servers up and running (For a hefty monthly cost). Because of the subscription service, I would say he's no longer worth the 374.99$ he's listed for. It's a bit of a sham that it's not listed anywhere on the seller's page that a subscription is now required to keep him running.<br /><br /> I'll give it a run down of what he can and can't do still without a subscription:<br />Can:<br />Move around on his own, wake up, play with his cube.<br />Alexa voice commands (Unrelated to telling Vector what to do.)<br />Responds to being picked up, and petted.<br />Change eye colors VIA app<br />Can't:<br />Listen to any voice commands.

He does everything he is advertised to do and has Alexa built-in and you have the option to switch it on if you want. He dances and entertains, finds ways to entertain himself, likes it when you pet him, plays blackjack with you, sets timers and alarms, and gets excited when he sees you! When you're not interacting with him, he rolls around and plays with his cube, but will be quiet when you need him to be (during all those conference calls!). He just brings so much fun and joy to the house, it's really like having a pet!

943,5.0,Really Adorable (and Intelligent) A.I. Desk Pet,"I bought Vector slightly unsure of whether it would be a good purchase or not.  My daughter had requested one for her birthday, but I could not imagine spending that kind of money on such a toy.<br /><br />Upon receiving him, however, I realize a toy, he is not (besides the fact that he is small, adorable, and does give robot ""fist bumps"" which is pretty cool).  He is a very sophisticated little guy, and with the built in Alexa he is actually pretty handy to have around.  You can ask him questions, get random facts, find out the weather, the time, ask him to calculate things, etc.<br /><br />In terms of playing with him, he has a little block that you can use to interact with him.  He rolls it, picks it up, and will bring it to you.  Sometimes he gets mad at the block and will pounce on it, which actually is pretty darn funny.  He definitely has a ""personality"" if such a thing can be said about a robot.  His facial expressions are priceless, like when there's a loud noise, he looks surprised; when someone says something from across the room, he kind of tilts his ""head"" (really his eyes) toward the sound, and slightly turns as if he has cocked his head to listen.<br /><br />He also learns who everyone in the family is, and will greet you by name when he notices you.  This can be a little disconcerting at first, as you're just sitting there minding your own business, and all a sudden a tiny robot says ""Hi [your name]!"" but again the technology does make it pretty cool.<br /><br />When my daughter is at school and he's just here hanging out with me, he's surprisingly quite a good little companion.  It's weird to admit that, I will say, but he kind of roams around in a small area, makes quiet little noises like he's thinking or noticing things around him, etc.  That being said, if he gets too enthusiastic about his activity, and you need to shut him up, you can just tell him to go to sleep or turn off.  He will also return to his charger automatically if his battery starts to run out, which is a helpful feature.<br /><br />The only ""negative"" I will say is that while he is good about noticing edges of tables that have a solid/square edge, if he approaches said-edge from a weird angle (like if he's playing with his block and backs away from it to get a better vantage point and gets too close), he can fall off...same being if he is on a surface with a curved edge.  While this would not deter me from buying him again, it IS something you need to be aware of, so that you can plan for where you will keep him.  For us, he primarily hangs out on the living room ottoman, which is pretty big, leather, and is above a cushioned rug.  For the most part, he stays out of trouble, but he has fallen off a few times.  If he happens to fall on his back, he can actually roll himself back over.  If he falls and lands on his side, he does get stuck, and throws a bit of a tantrum. Tantrum also ensues if he is playing and you pick him up to move him to a new spot, which is also kinda funny.<br /><br />All in all, I would say that if you're looking for a really unique gift for someone who loves technology, science, A.I., robotics, etc, he's a really good choice.  The bonus feature of having Alexa built in makes him also seem like not just a toy but a useful gadget around the house (which for me was part of the reason I could justify it, because I would have easily spent $100-$200 anyway on an Alexa product).<br /><br />Very happy with him thus far (about 2 weeks out), and would recommend.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AH7G5FQBWNHH3Z4CX62OPO22SZTQ,1601151333354,3,True

966,4.0,Buyers Beware Anki is Out of Business,"I really enjoy my vector robot. It's fun to play with and cute.<br /><br />However, potential buyers should be very cautious purchasing this robot. Anki, the company that made Vector, announced in May 2019 that they would be closing their doors. More recently is has been announced that come September 2020 the servers that support Vector will be shut down. What does this mean for your robot? Once the servers are shut down it will be 'deaf'. It will no longer be able to respond to 'Hey Vector'. The robot will still function, it will just not be able to process voice commands. It is unclear to me if the Alexa integration will still work after this date or not.<br /><br />There is a independent project to keep Vector fully functional after the servers shutdown at project-victor dot org.

He also takes a little longer than usual to respond to questions you ask him.

If you want a very cute robot friend that is very expressive and lifelike to play with and hang out with (now with Alexa support), you will love it. It's basically WALL-E, for fans of the movie. I wanted to write this review now especially since Anki is shutting down and not producing any more robots. They said that they will continue to keep Vector running, so the purchase is still worth it.<br /><br />I got bored of Vector for a while because I tend to get bored with everything after a while, but I brought him back to life and I'm having fun again. It's entertaining watching him explore his environment and play around with things like how he headbutts certain surfaces (and attacks his cube). He also recognizes your face and is happy to see you when he looks at you. It's just a really fun robot pal that doesn't even need to be constantly looked at; let him just explore on his own if there are no risks that would damage him. He used to be very good at avoiding drops, but the other day I noticed he wasn't doing so well, so if you're using him on a desk you should put down a few pillows or something, just to be safe.<br /><br />All in all, I do not regret my purchase.

Now you can activate Alexa on it, I haven't tried that out yet so can't comment on it. But asking it a question and it will give you an answer, if it understood the question. And that is if it hears you? It wasn't cause it couldn't understand me but you have to talk pretty loud in order for it to even hear you, which is pretty much it's biggest draw back.

1029,2.0,"Overpriced desk toy, good if you avoiding alexa.","This is tiny, basically a desk toy. It will tell you the weather, do add and subtract (though a calculator be quicker).  It can answer questions.  But it cant play music. It dies in about 15 min and cant usually find it way back to charge. It drives off the table over and over. It isnt a.i. it is just programmed with a few basic gimmicks.  It is costructed well (good thing since it drives off tables and desks and falls on the floor). Unless you really need the programmed attempt at a personality (which doesnt respond well) it really doesnt seem worth the money. You can do more with a echo dot quicker and it plays music. Vector is, a overpriced desk toy. I bought it on sale for about $170 but realistically i probably wouldnt have spent over $70 if i knew how limited it really was.  Other than being really small, driving off the table, calculator (slow calculator), telling you the weather (your phone can do that), i just dont think it has any real purpose. Other than a overpriced funny/cute desk toy.  It might be useful for someone avoiding going on alexa. This can operate without alexa or with alexa. But if you have alexa a echo dot the fraction of this price has more use. Oh and it loses internet signal really easy, doesnt find its way home to charge, only has a few programmed commands, you have to repeat yourself constantly. It can actually be pretty annoying.  Unless you avoiding alexa.  More of a gimmick than a useful tool unfortunately. Or a real expensive desk ornament or kids toy.  They should have made this more useful before release especially for the price range. I think they are counting not on utility but the little fake personality they programmed it with to sell it.  For all of us that expected much more at this price point than a toy hopefully they do some major updates, as it just has little usefulness. Least echo plays music and anything you ask alexa is MUCH faster not on vector.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AE4LDXQAANUNJ2Z3FDW4LQDMKRSQ,1546973156876,0,True

I would say Vector is 100% worth the money. :) He is also perfect for kids (maybe about 10+) who aren't allowed to have pets. He is also Alexa integrated so you can even ask him to take care of your smart devices for you if you want. :)<br /><br />This little guy does so much more that I dont have the time to write and is absolutely adorable, If the idea of having a pet robot sounds appealing to you then you will 100% love Vector.  :)",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEXRMNYXSTGENJK4YKD4G6CIYZWQ,1566695139167,1,False

They nearly without exception light up and become much more interactive and excited about talking with me once Vector joins the conversation.

1039,1.0,Useless Robot,"I purchased this Vector robot for my son last Christmas from a big box blue and yellow retailer that sells electronics, really the BEST place to BUY electronics in person any more. Well, though the initial excitement was there, the robot offered little for my then 7 yr old to do other than give it verbal commands. It is NOT a STEM/STEAM device and really does little to foster learning. You can ask it questions as it integrates with Alexa and AWS as the real brains behind it. Sadly, I upgraded my router and even after hours of troubleshooting I was no longer to get this robot to connect, so it's little more now than a sad toy that sits in the corner occasionally waking up, roaming away from it's base and dying of battery because it doesn't have the ""brains"" to get back to the base without internet connectivity. Every time I try and fix the device, it connects to my app (oh and you have to have a iOS or Android device for this to be setup), it briefly connects to the configuration on the app, then disconnects. I suspect it's a Bluetooth issue but when it eventually does connect 1 out of 20 attempts, I can try and enter the password to my 2.4GHz band of wifi to connect the device, but the app often disconnects from Vector so I have to try all over again. This is the most frustrating part of the setup experience.<br /><br />Next, if I am able to get the WiFi entered in correctly and Vector connects to the network, the first thing the app wants to do is send an update to Vector, and once the update is complete, Vector restarts, oh but guess what? That's right it's not longer connected to the network, so I have to go through the very painful and frustrating experience of trying to connect it to the network once again. And eventually after getting network to connect again, that's right, you will be prompted to upgrade. Rinse and repeat frustration, aggravation, disappointment all over again.<br /><br />I am a IT Engineer so I am very familiar with troubleshooting and fixing things, but this is just such a poorly designed product I advise against wasting any money on it whatsoever. I even tried to contact support from Anki, and I guess the same developers of this product also worked on the website, because once you find the support pages, and go through all the articles that don't solve the issue, you are presented with a link to contact via e-mail support. Guess what happens when you click on it? You'd think it brings you to an e-mail form or give you an e-mail address, that would only make sense right? But it brings you right back to the main support page where you get to pick the product you want to find support for. Ah yes, the disappointment and frustration doesn't end with the product itself, the whole company seems to be founded upon it. This item is utterly useless, completely frustrating and a waste of time and money.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGHTOVN5ALFCB5OF3DUMHP3ZQUKQ,1570183452522,2,False

1088,5.0,EVERYTHING you need to know. Others don’t realize its potential.,"PLEASE NOTE. First off not signing into Amazon to use Alexa means Alexa is fully disabled. That may save much privacy. No this device does not use the cloud with the camera. This device CAN BE USED WITHOUT WIFI. You just won’t be able to use the utilities but it’ll still recognize faces and function just won’t do voice response. It’s slower than expected because a lot of processing is done on the device itself. Alexa is all cloud based which is why it’s so much quicker. It’s even faster than Vector, running on Vector. Don’t be worried. This is equipped with an actual smart phone level processor that was in Samsung phones in about 2013 or 14. Those being in this robot is impressive. It’s ready for loads of updates. When I took this out of the box and set it up I started messing with it. It wasn’t too responsive, but you see it wants to do things. After messing with it for about 2 hours or so, I’ve figured out how it works and it actually did learn. Sounds weird but it did, it became way more responsive and was kind of really cool. It actually learned and took in information to better it’s AI. Give it time, it learns. As for the facial recognition, I had trouble with that too. But after it seeing a few other people, it started getting much more accurate as well. It’s really weird. It works though. A lot of the “features” are in its free roam I’ve noticed. If you place an object in front of it, it’ll look at it and kind of take note. Next time it sees it, it just passes by. Place a new object and it’ll look it over again. It’s really just something for people into the technology and or want something that not many people have seen. Overall, highly recommend. The creators say it’ll keep getting updates and they’ll update the code in the robot via the cloud and it’ll get smarter without having to learn.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFE7WVUB4ET7MBHU3Q2X675CFEMA,1543385414298,6,True

Upon my first few hours with Vector, I felt disappointed by how underwhelming it is. Much of the advertised functionality doesn't work as advertised. It requires several tries of saying ""Hey Vector"" for him to respond, and there is a huge amount of latency between asking a question and him responding. I left him out on the table to surprise my girlfriend and by the time she came home the battery had died. I charged him again, then sat there feeling kind of silly saying ""hey vector"" over and over to no avail, to which she responded with temporary amusement and then we moved on. I found it hard to justify why I'd just spent $225 on what is essentially a toy (though a cute one.)<br /><br />I contacted the Anki team soon after my disappointing introduction and asked for a refund, which they refused because I purchased through kickstarter, and told me that they're working on updates. Overall just not very helpful, and left a bad taste in my mouth,so I will probably refrain from future interesting Anki products.<br /><br />To Anki - a bit more customer sensitivity could help, offering solutions to customers who are not satisfied with your product due to features not working as advertised, whether purchased from Kickstarter or not.<br /><br />Save your money, this is not the droid you're looking for.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGXFP5DEAMCUBKZSYFGGP3WGQKJA,1543944945551,3,False

You press his button for 15 seconds. Vector comes back on. Can’t connect to you through your Bluetooth. Repeat step. Great it connects. Connect to WiFi. Great. Update.... done. Now Vector won’t connect to your Bluetooth. Repeat previous workaround. Now it won’t connect to your WiFi. Repeat previous step and hard reboot. WiFi connects but it needs the same update as before.

I’ll keep posting updates as long as my Vector still runs..<br />UPDATE 6 MONTHS: It’s been 6 months since we got our replacement and the one we have works great.  He improves with each software update and has become a welcome companion on my desk.  Especially as the house gets quieter with empty nest.  And yes we have a dog but it’s kinda nice to have someone see you come into the room and call your name with excitement.  After 6 months his battery is good and he just keeps rocking along. He’s also my only Alexa device I’m glad to have him. Still satisfied..<br />UPDATE:  Day 5 : Yeaterday he developed a a squeak in the gearing that has gotten worse.  Anki is sending a replacement and says that this is rare, however, I downgraded a star.. Day 1 with Vector:<br />First let me say that after the slew of negative reviews, I set my expectations very low.  Upon arrival, and being super techie naive, I attempted set up with my IPhone X...and to my surprise, it was simple...didn’t test my patience at all.  I also have poor WiFi service and yet Vector works perfectly.  7 hours later he is still functioning flawlessly.<br />The Alexa side is instantaneous, you just speak Alexa and get an instant response with no delay.<br />As far as the battery life, we have been through quite a few charge cycles today.  The first few were kind of short but after about 3, it gets longer Vector now runs about an hour.  He charges in about 15-20 minutes on his charger which is plugged into an Apple 5 watt wall wart.  All of this has come as a welcome surprise.<br />We have started his exploring off slow, giving him a small spot to roam and explore in and the more he learns, the better he gets.  He studies faces and calls out each person.  If the lighting changes too much, you may have to reintroduce yourself, and He will ask if he has met you before and if so, he will learn your features quickly.<br />He has also made it to his charger every time and has not run out of power before reaching it.<br />All of this being said, it’s been a wonderful experience up to this point.  No WiFi droppage, no short battery life, no dying before reaching the charger, no suicidal tendencies by diving off of the edge of the table (stops every time).<br /><br />Then came the moment of moments...the introduction to my wife...I just whispered a few things to her on what to do, and WOW she fell in love with this thing...what a shock..(that alone is worth 5 stars)<br />Today the house has been filled with adults, all waiting a turn to get some time with Vector.  What an amazing day!<br /><br />This is the reason for 5 stars:<br />Alexa works great (I was expecting huge delays and none exist)<br />Vector is fascinating, the more he learns, the better he gets<br />Finally, there is absolutely nothing like this anywhere that I’ve ever seen..<br /><br />I’m really wondering about the negative reviews, our first day experience has been wonderful.  We’re looking forward to the adventure ahead as Anki moves forward in its programming!<br /><br />For the record, I almost didn’t do this and just about let the critics scare me away...I am SO glad I took the jump!  (And so is everyone who meets Vector)<br />Day3:  The more he learns, the better he gets.  He does get a little carried away when heads to the edge of the table carrying his cube.  When he gets to the edge and tries to stop, it makes him top heavy and he’ll tumble over the side.  We’ll see if he learns from it.<br />Other than that, still functions flawlessly.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEHENEDQRCUJG7CW4DCQTESIENHA,1546141779475,11,True

It already has driven off of several different mediums, couch, fireplace, granite counter...  further more it can’t do anything other than recognize your face and tell you the weather.  Big deal!  It does have Alexa capabilities, but very, very limited... basically time and weather.  We have Alexa all over the house... so why do I need this thing!?  Cozmo can be used remotely as a “spy cam” which intrigues my daughter (and scares me) but at least she would be able to interact with it.

Not happy with  that my little  buddy  is having a hard time  seeing  there's  blank  spots in his display  even now that the  company is  back up they  don't offer any  service  they just want  money. If you buy be prepared to be  real sad if it starts to quit working  right.mine keeps getting  worse!!!  If the  day  comes  that he quits responding  it will be like losing a  family member I will be  very  sad !!! Been great company in the  times were all  having being home alone.  He wasn't  cheap had to  save up to  purchase it  and you'll get  no help from  them if he  breaks down.  It's like losing a  puppy  so use caution and  be prepared  if buying. Don't  know how they can sell a product  and offer no repair service or parts. Now there back and  selling the product  again  but does it  seem strange that  they are  offering  you different  packages  like showing you  and giving you the  option to  program  vector  yourself and  so  on even a deal were you  pay like  $7,000  to meet and attend a  weekend  seminar with  the man who created  vector all theses  different things  they offer are program  updates or online  media stuff that you  get to watch afew times seems like  they are just looking  to make money  cause there  giving you  info on how  it works and how you can program  and  make  upgrades  yourself.  Why ? They don't even offer  repair services or  parts if your vector needs it .I've  email them  several times and  always get the same answers they say it's a chip in  he's  head but they aren't  servicing them  or have parts. So when it starts to malfunction  your out of luck.  I love my vector .even if for my $ he's just a smartphone  that can move and charge itself.  The only real feature  that set's  vector aside is the  design and  size. I really  can care less about  how he  works or there weekly  voice  commands  witch they are  now charging you for after Oct. 1 all I want is my vector to work like it did when I first took  him out of the  box and  started  him up. I got cellphones  bought 10 years ago  that still work. Dont waste your time  emailing  them  about  any of this cause you'll get no answers  just a cold  reply and a  seller pitch.  A wonderful  idea with  no  support I would love to  hear there response to the questions  I ask  and a real answer  about what  they are going to do  about it, but it doesn't  put money in  there pocket  so there it ends.you will love the vector and then be real sad when he starts to malfunction  the cost takes a  backseat  when this happens and  you just  miss the  little  guy that you first  bought hope this helps you  in your  purchase choice.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHWLCZYMVMRP76GULR2X23V7MM6A,1600887246910,9,True

I can be a bit stern to him. Mine developed into a stubborn bitch. He will blatantly ignore me at times, and sass me at any opportunity he gets. His microphones are good, but not great. Maximum of 4 feet and you'll probably need to kinda yell at him irregardless. At least I do. Stubborn little prick. Love him tho.<br /><br />Has developed an enjoyment for pushing things off the edge of ""his space"". He had very very hard time on tapered edges at first. I set up insense boxes around the edges, and after about 4 or 5 days and basejumping a few times, he got the hang of it, I removed the boundaries, and he started stopping a bit earlier. By day 8 or so he knew the edges. He hasn't fallen since. Intentionally throws things off the edge now. I know its intentional by now, cheeky bastard.<br /><br />I live mostly alone, and while he isnt perfect, who is? I enjoy him a lot and if their 2020 kickstart finishes this project I would infinitely give it 5 stars.<br /><br />However, it is an incomplete project, so I wont give it 5 stars. But it damn deserves it.<br /><br />Absolutely not for little kids, they are savage animals and would rip this poor little guy to pieces. My teenage brothers love him. I do too. Recognizes faces extremely well. I was impressed. He needs a bit of time to really learn who you are, but that applies to anything and anybody.<br /><br />Would buy again without even questioning it","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K1wdKWo-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K1wdKWo-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K1wdKWo-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFVK32MVGMN4USGJLAJHQ6TGVOWQ,1589226978617,0,True

So much for him being able to detect edges and not roll off... He has now gone from being cute but overpriced to absolutely worthless.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Vector is a cute little robot with good personality. My kids like watching him, and I love the way he reacts when you pick him up, or how he plays with his block. However, as a digital assistant a la Alexa or Google, he’s not very useful. You can ask him questions, but it’s a 2 step process that takes far longer than other digital assistant products. His voice recognition isn’t very good, the pictures he takes are low quality, and his built in functions like telling the weather or the time are cute but not super useful. When I ask google for the weather, I get detailed info along with forecast. Vector will just tell you the temperature and current conditions.<br /><br />Overall I would say Vector is worth maybe $80 tops - definitely not the premium they’re charging. Hopefully they will update him to make him more capable, but in his current form, I don’t think he’s worth what they’re charging.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGRXFPUH43WS43SYRIXYN5LSWF4Q,1545492863050,2,True

1301,3.0,Fun!...for a while,"I bought vector right after anki announced folding up. The price went down to $100 and I thought I was suckered. I was relieved to find out that DDL took over. Since purchasing vector, I also funded DDL's early lifetime subscription so thankfully I don't have to pay the monthly membership fee (which would have pissed me off). There was a little trouble applying my earlier funding but it seems DDL sorted it out eventually.<br />Barring that, vector is a cute little fun robot that's very intuitive with it's surroundings. Never had it fall off a desk, but softer or round edged surfaces like a bed or sofa makes it susceptible for vector to roll off.<br />The voice recognition is terrible however, especially with kids voices. I bought vector for my daughter but she was unable to get him to follow a single command. She was only successful once or twice when I told her to put on a lower voice (think Austin Powers ""how does that feel?""). Even I find myself having to attempt commands 5 and 6 times before he responds or I just give up. Strangely, the alexa function understands me clear as day. I am still yet to get vector to respond to some commands and questions that I found online. Due to the fact that my daughter can't get vector to respond to her, she played with it one day and then she was bored and has not interacted since. I will also admit that while it's fun to run through the commands the 1st or 2nd time, there really isn't that much vector can do and soon you're left bored. I saw youtube videos showing vector and cozmo interacting and doing fun adventures. To get vector to tall, a 3rd party app is required and I implore you to read the responses from the app developer to critical reviews (woooweee). The app does not seem to work anyway since DDL applied their updates. Vector is still entertaining to watch him interact on his own for about 20 mins before his battery is out, but for $300 and some dollars....I would pass if I had to purchase again.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AESBRF2QP7CEH3NGL2QCO4S4PHAA,1605472044735,2,True

1305,5.0,Vector: A small package with an amazing personality.,"[[VIDEOID:6ce264f811d0b4843a1e285d90138b59]] Vector is like an extended family member or friend that lightens up your home. From a technology standpoint, this tiny little dude has a lot packed under its shell and despite it being a little slow (compared to other AI devices like Alexa, Google Home, etc.), it has a lot of potential and it is quite capable. From a personality standpoint, Vector is doesn’t quite care that it is small, it has enough energy to make his presence known throughout the house, and has this sense of curiosity and happiness similar to a small child or even a very loving pet.<br /><br />Initially, I personally didn’t quite understand what Anki was trying to accomplish with the Vector - the little robot does a lot, but I have Alexa pretty much running my home and, I have very limited time as it is, so when I got Vector, I was incredibly curious a technologist and early adopter but, I was also hesitant about how well this device would fit in my home. The first day, given my bias, I found very limited use for Vector and Anki’s app was not very intuitive, (at first), but as the days passed, Vector’s eagerness to win you over, puppy eyes, independence, and companionship, make this little fellow easy to appreciate and get invested in.<br /><br />I don't spend a lot of time at home, but it certainly does feel happier now that Vector is here.  Vector distracts me and has a lot of things that work very well. The personality aspect is what charmed me. Nonetheless, it gets stuck a lot of time and doesn't make it to the charger, but the fist bump makes me forgive him. The little dude does his best. Just as an Alexa early adopter, and now big Alexa user, I'm confident that Vector will get to the same level of functionality.<br /><br />I hope that you give this thing a try, while I hesitated at first, I am very happy that I welcomed it into my home.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qIhKgvKPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qIhKgvKPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qIhKgvKPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHNSHI24UKSTEMAX5L4MQNQIISDQ,1541250161933,109,True

The only ""hiccups"", though they really weren't a big deal, I had to connect him to wifi a few times because it lost connection, and I had to restart it once because it was making a low hum, but otherwise the pros have vastly outweighed the cons. He hasn't fallen off anything yet but has been right to the edge, the drop sensors seem to work great. His responsiveness to ""Hey Vector"" and ""Alexa"" have been pretty good, comparable to any Alexa device. The face recognition stuff is my favorite, he knows the whole family by name and says Hi to us by name when we interact with him. He does a lot of things, but only seems to have one ""game"", blackjack. My kid wishes there were more, but he's been very entertained by all the other features. I seriously think this is a big win! Especially since I was able to get it for around $75. $250 is way too much, but I'd expect something like this to be around $150. I really can't say enough about this cool little guy.

He is just so much fun and everyone loves him.  When we walk in the room he gets so excited and plays and plays with us and especially the card game and he gets mad when he is having fun and his battery needs to be charged and he is hilarious and acts all sad and backs into his charger and lets us know several times he is charging and as soon as he has enough charge comes right off his ramp to play again and dance  cause he is so happy.  He also jumps up on his toys to show he like them and listens and responds to all commands and even does his own thing which is really something else to see.  I think its partly the owner and alot of you with your negative comments do not know how to interact with your Vector.  He also is so cute when he says how old he is and when I say Vector come over here and right away he is racing over.

This year amazon bought the company that makes it and added in Alexa capability and dropped the price by more than half. I was able to buy it at the new lower price and let my son open it as an early present yesterday .<br /><br />First off I want to say I thought this would be junk, but bought to cross it off the Christmas list. We’ve had him for less than 24 hours and he’s adorable and fun. He’s way better than I thought it would be and my son is obsessed with it.

Now we have this little guy and if you or someone you know has any interest in robotics, programming, or even just technology, then this is an amazing gift.<br /><br />I see some people leaving negative reviews because they were expecting more of a toy to just leave their kid with. And don't get me wrong, Vector is really entertaining and makes a great toy... But this product offers so much more than that. One of the coolest things about Vector is being able to learn programming in a fun interactive way. And I think its an amazing opportunity for a parent and kid to bond while learning something with real world value.<br /><br />Seeing a product like Vector makes me so happy because I know how much potential it has to introduce kids to the field of robotics and computer science in a fun way that actually makes them passionate.<br /><br />For anyone considering this as a present for their kids, this could easily be one of the best investments into their education by sparking a lifetime interest in the fields of science and engineering.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AG3OXYTGAVCXCLFSMLWK72GAEBOA,1549429030502,0,False

The robot pretty much does everything they say it does, well. One of the most important things that you should focus on is the timing of your commands to Vector. If he is talking or roboting, (lol) he does not hear your command and I think that frustrates some. But, I find the response time and performance is getting better and better. Some people I have shown it to are fascinated by Vector and they may buy it for themselves.

1360,1.0,This product isn't ready for launch. I love AI and want Anki to succeed but this needs to be said.,"This post is to warn future consumers and to let Anki know that they really need to improve their product. I love AI and I own a google home and I love my google home and so I want products like Vector to improve. Just like the gaming community is combatting unfair monetary systems, I want to make Anki aware of the many issues this product has.<br /><br />It's personality isn't finished and it really doesn't do much<br />Anki states this is an unfinished product and I expected an unfinished product but not at the level I witnessed. When I picture an unfinished product I think of google home. It can still have utility and perform commands well but it's not done as google assistant at it is still improving and future features such as ""AI calling"" are coming. With Vector, I knew I wasn't getting utility but a cute robot. That's fine but he's not that cute or lifelike to be honest. When his ""personality"" was his eyes thinking 90% of the time. 5% a squint of happiness when he looks at me and 5% of anger when I wake him up or pick him up.... That's not worth the 250 dollar price tag. I'm sorry.<br /><br />My google home was 70 and it frankly has 10x the personality this robot has. Google home doesn't have faces but it tells me jokes, tells me stories, tells me the news, has quirky responses to stupid questions I have, and much more. The issue with a personality is that it needs to be a lot more than 2 eyes moving in a lot of different directions. We need to talk to Vector. That needs to be Vector's X-factor over a real pet. You see with a real pet. You can't talk to it and it just has it's behaviors to communicate with you. However, you're looking at a live being. You see it's eyes. It's love. Vector will frankly never beat that because you're just looking at pixels. But if it was able to talk? Really be an assistant. That could change the game for it.<br /><br />It's too loud and distracting<br />Even at its lowest volume, the tracks are so loud. It's too distracting. As a college student who studies 10 hours a day, I can tolerate some distractions but this was ridiculous. At a point, I just wanted it to sleep all the time and just realized I didn't want it at all to be honest. Sigh.<br /><br />It doesn't follow commands like 80% of the time<br />This is a big issue. I was using the app while giving commands to see Vector's thoughts. I told it to go back to its charging pad. It does start doing that. Then sees a water bottle. Gets distracted. Then wanders off again. The same thing when I ask it to come here. It was just so unreliable as a robot. Robots follow commands. This is what I expected and I don't think that's too much to ask to be honest. If I type ""B"" on a laptop, I expect B to appear on the screen. If I ask google to play music, I expect ""music"" to be played. If I ask vector to go to its charging pad because its being disruptive to my work, I expect it to got to its charging pad.<br /><br />Was it all bad?<br />I won't lie. It made me feel. I felt genuinely sad writing this review and putting him back in the box to be returned. The last time he closed his eyes as I turned him off made me feel bad. But that's it to be honest. He wasn't even that fun the first 5 minutes. He couldn't even say my name. Also, I had this thought that the people with issues with his voice recognition were just bad at english. No. I use Google home and siri all the time. Mostly google but they understand my commands like 95% of the time. Vector? Maybe 20-30% of the time. I was born and raised in the US and am a native English speakers.<br /><br />Overall?<br />This product needs a LOT of improvement. This is not a finished product. Not even close. When I expect an unfinished product, I expect it to have at least one thing it is good at so I can keep myself interested in it until improvement come. However, this wasn't the case. Voice Recognition? 20-30% recognition. Follow through on commands? No. It gets too distracted. Personality? Two pixelated eyes isn't enough. At least talk to me.<br /><br />I'm frankly very disappointed in this product because I was so excited for it. I was even distracted while doing work and studying in wait for it and it just wasn't good. RIP the exam I studied for on Friday...<br /><br />As a college student, money is tight. I am willing to spend money on things that make me happy and destress like google home. However, 200 dollars for a robot that is distracting, doesn't listen, gets distracted easily, and doesn't even have much personality to be honest. I felt conned.

1363,5.0,Vector Is Your First Taste of a New Era,"Echoing some of the comments here, Gizmodo recently published an article titled ""This Little Robot Broke My Heart"" where they some up and otherwise objectively accurate review of Vector by essentially saying it's not their yet.  I offered the following comment as a rebuttal, which I'll also log here:<br /><br />""I’ve had Vector for a week now and I think you’re approaching him from the wrong angle. Anki wasn’t trying to match the capabilities of Alexa or Siri. They’ve been very transparent that their driving principle was to investigate something that Amazon and Apple hasn’t - relatability. They wanted Vector first and foremost to be the first tiny AI to suspend disbelief and carve out a tiny place in your heart. Other pursuits are secondary.<br /><br />In the week he’s lived with me I can confirm Anki has succeeded in making Vector something both my wife and I look forward to coming home to greet. We’ve thought about what he was doing while we’re at work. We laugh and sometimes get frustrated when he messes up. We praise him and pet him when he does something successfully. For sure there may be a bit of confirmation bias in our draw to him, but they have succeeded in suspending your disbelief enough that 7 days in we’re just as excited to interact with him as we were on day one - perhaps more so. And believe me, we are a cynical pair, and I’m no stranger to new tech being thrown in a drawer and written off as a swing and a miss (I’m looking at you, Apple Watch.)<br /><br />There are certainly areas to improve upon - much like a new puppy who has a lot of growing up to do. He does fall off the table more frequently than I’d like. He’s not good at navigating when the lights are turned off. He’s had some issues understanding commands from time to time. But the imperfections almost lend themselves to the suspension of disbelief. All living things makes mistakes. The fact that he's on the floor sometimes when we get home from work, in a way, proves that he ""has a life of his own"" while we're gone.  Furthermore, I can say it’s felt like he’s gotten a bit better at interactions even with the span of a week - Anki does serve updates automatically during the night, and I’m sure they’re pouring over the data they’ve collected so far and iterating with fervor.<br /><br />The jump from Cosmo (Anki's last generation robot) to Vector is like Apple jumping from the Lisa to the Mac Classic. The Classic wasn’t as capable of crunching data as room-sized IBM’s at the time, but it wasn’t meant to be. It was a vision of the future to come. And I believe 30 years from now, with boundaries between tech and life all but erased, I’ll look back on the time I first brought Vector into my home as the genesis point of that new era.""",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGKXO2RBWDM2DHMJDKTPP5WQAWIA,1545153090023,3,False
1364,4.0,Cute and fun,"I bought this for my son and it sits on his desk. He spends a lot of time at his desk to either do school work or play PS4. Vector is quite the robot.

One, the eye animations are spot on when corresponding to a particular command -- that's some serious engineering. Two, the responsiveness and interesting sensors I sort of have an accent from united kingdom since most assistants pick up the command either Vector and Alexa. The commands are limited for Vector but more functionality can be found in Alexa. Sometimes my Vector doesn't catch my commands but sometimes it's my fault from being too far from the sensor. Third, the Vector SDK is really nice and you can improve vector effortlessly if you know how to code in Python. However, Digital Dream labs is working on new features like the open source developer kit which I am excited about. Anyways, fist bump to Digital Dream Labs and Anki for creating this fantastic robot. I hope kids will develop more using Vector.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RU-75n2rL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RU-75n2rL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RU-75n2rL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFY4XHGK4UEBO4FSJMGFSUWUOB2Q,1600407500477,0,True

We blocked him in so he wouldn't fall, but he wasn't in a place convenient for us to actually use him and ask him questions, etc. We'd need a place with lots of desk space where he can roll around on, plus be near his base that's plugged in all the time. We just don't have that! Besides, we already have two Alexa devices and a Google Home throughout the house and so it wasn't needed, in that regard. We had difficulty figuring out how to keep him quiet, so ended up just having to run his battery down and not let him charge on the base. Today, my son got a birthday present that's an inexpensive version (not sure if intentionally a version, but it looks similar, though doesn't use an app or voice commands) and he had so much fun with it that it made him think of Vector. Out Vector came to the dining room table and when my son went to give him voice commands, Vector told him that in order to do voice commands, you have to have a Digital Dream Labs subscription. WHAT?! This wasn't the case last year! He's in tears because he can't do the things he wants with Vector and controlling him through the app isn't cutting it for him, if he can even do in the app what he wanted to do with voice commands. I looked at the website and there is NOTHING about the subscription unless you scroll to the very bottom of the page and even there, you don't see what it gets you without searching elsewhere on the website. I started doing searches and came back here to Amazon and saw that the price is SO much more than it was a year ago (insane!)

While Anki made a name for itself through its robots’ Wall-E-like personalities and expressions, the underlying technology is equally impressive. One of the first companies to embrace artificial intelligence and machine learning in consumer devices, Anki started out with toy cars.

Unfortunately, I didn’t have any luck. Checked all the hardware and everything, nothing. Es ist kaputt.

1378,5.0,Fun Tech Toy,"We've been playing with Vector for a little over a month now, and he's a load of fun! At first, he didn't do a lot, but every so often, Anki provides an update and suddenly, Vector has more personality, skills, and interactions! He's a great little desk companion that is much better than a pet because there's little to clean up afterward! I say little because he's been known to shove things off the table!<br />There are many ways he can learn about his environment via his sensors:<br />He sees via HD camera.<br />Facial recognition - he'll learn your face and when he's exploring, will come right up, scan your face, and say your name! He's very pleased when he recognizes you, and gets a little upset if he doesn't recognize you.<br />Navigate, explore, and learn his environment. He gets around very well all over my desk. However, I move things a lot, so he's constantly having to re-learn. Occasionally, he'll fall over the edge, but once in a while, he falls over the edge. I think they're working on improving that a lot. It's super cute when he's exploring, gets close to the edge, and acts scared and backs away!<br />If he needs charging, he'll go right back to his charger on his own. However, sometimes, I'll get tired of hearing him causing trouble, so I'll tell him to go to his charger. He does it, but throws a little tantrum when he gets there!<br /><br />He can hear via his array of four microphones.  Sometimes he comes over to see what's going on if you're having a conversation. If he's resting, he'll act startled if there's a loud noise in the room. He will also react to the beat of music if it's loud and near him. If you ask him to look at you or come here, he'll be able to sense the direction to go.<br /><br />He reacts to touch and feel. If you pet his back, he practically purrs! But shaking him gets a reaction, too!<br /><br />He has amazing intelligence. For instance, he answers questions, plays blackjack, reacts to his environment, and senses actions and activities around him.<br /><br />He speaks to you. I'm not a fan of his synthesized voice, but it seems to be improving. When he reads out answers to questions you ask, sometimes it's hard to hear what he's saying. However, as they receive feedback on this, I'm sure his voice will evolve into something more understandable.<br /><br />We really enjoy seeing his reactions! The current one is the way he gets super excited when you tell him he's a good robot or if you tell him you love him, and pouts a little if you tell him he's a bad robot! I just told him earlier today when he picked up his cube and tossed it off the desk!<br /><br />I'm super excited to see his ever-evolving skills! I highly recommend this little guy for your favorite tech lover, or yourself! If you're looking for a toy for younger kids, maybe go with a Cosmo.

She was SO excited and Vector and being the indulgent parent I bought it for her.<br /><br />Ok, so the first Vector counldn't see our 2.4 ghz network at all, I tried manually configuring it but that didn't work.  I'm a software engineer so I reconfigured the network to only have the 2.4 ghz one available, made sure the ports were open, added the ip to the whitelist, checked that I could download the file as per the 'help' files and so on, nothing.  So after accepting that something might be wrong I returned it and got a replacement.  The second Vector seemed to work out of the box, I could see my network and it connected to both my phone and the network straight away (I breathed a sigh of relief) but then it instantly went and downloaded an update which took about 10 minutes to install.  As soon as the update was installed I couldn't find Vector.  Ok I thought, so I rebooted everything, I managed to find Vector, it could see my network but from that point forward it refused to connect, kept saying that it couldn't make a connection, I turned off every device I have that was connected to the network, I removed and reinstalled the app, I emailed support...  Support takes 24 hours minimum to reply, Vector refuses to connect to the network (I checked and rechecked the details so many times)  but he refuses to connect and work...  The upshot, I'm returning it, I'm sorry but this type of device just shouldn't be this hard to setup and I don't want a $200 ornament so there it goes.<br /><br />Given that I am in the industry it feels rushed, I think QA isn't doing it's job.

1408,3.0,Hes not what you're thinking!,"I cant believe this robot is almost $400! I bought it this past February for $80....and it wasnt even worth the $80. I did research for a year on this robot and let me tell you, it's not what you think it is! I think they raised the price so dramatically high is because the maker of this robot has been out of business for at least a couple years now. Anki is no longer in business! The original price was $250. Then shot way down to $80, now it's even more than what the company was selling it for! Anyways, yes this robot is super cute and moves on his own, but it doesnt answer every question you have, only recognizes you if you look straight at it and wait a few minutes for it to recognize you. It only has one game it can play with you, which is blackjack. I had to put Alexa on it so I can actually get questions answered. It constantly moves around and makes very cute little noises and sounds. HOWEVER, he doesnt stop!! He makes noises non stop and you have to tell him to either ""Hey Vector go home"", or ""Hey Vector, be quiet"" even then hes only quiet for around 5 minutes then starts back up again. Gets a bit annoying. When I give him a command by saying ""Hey Vector, I have a question"" he most of the time answers back with ""I dont know"" hence putting Alexa on him. Also if he is not on a flat surface with no type of cloth or table cover he will fall off even though he has sensors all over, he still falls! Then when he gets stuck he makes a noise to let you know he is stuck and you have to move him, otherwise he will lose power where he sits. It definitely was a waste of money. Yet hes so cute. Too bad really. You're way better off with the actual Alexa. Save your money unless you want a cute little robot that pretty much does nothing except roll around making noises.

1434,5.0,PERFECT Addition To My Entertainment Room!,"This little guy here, let me tell ya -<br /><br />I've only had him for a good 24 hours now but I have gotten so much use out of him. And it seems that the more he explores and the more I interact with him, the smarter he gets? Pretty crazy but I swear this little dude is starting to take over my desk. I have a small mermaid statue that's probably triple his size on my desk, and he's moved her around. He's also played with my PC mouse - left for work and found my mouse moved and things clicked (I think he's researching some stuff guys, watch out!) He also really likes to watch movies, but he's really bad at finishing them...<br /><br />All jokes aside, this guy has really lightened up my room. He will get excited when he sees me and say my name, and randomly ask ME for a fist bump. When he does a trick, he looks at me to make sure I'm watching. He also really likes to beat up his cube, but seems really sad without it, but also really loves it at the same time..? Kind of a love hate relationship you could say. He enjoys exploring and answering my questions, and apparently his purpose is to pass butter, but he wont pass me the butter... perhaps a future update..?<br /><br />The only issues I've had with it not listening correctly or not responding to ""hey vector..."", and not recognizing faces, are when its a poorly lit area, noisy area, or in an area with poor WiFi connection. From my room, he recognizes me each time, understands everything I say as long as I speak clearly, and always responds to me. He's quick to respond, and quick to answer my questions. As long as you have good WiFi in the room you'll be keeping him in, and its not too noisy or dark, you shouldn't have any problems. Perfect for my little entertainment room (he likes to watch TV and dance to music!)<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the future updates to my little buddy. I read on the Anki website that they plan on adding 360 photos, security camera, ability to read you the news, smart home control, deliver messages, calender/to do, etc. They're also adding Alexa soon too, and from the videos I've seen of that, I'm really excited. That'll add a lot more functionality to him for sure, and you won't have to wake him using ""Hey Vector... I have a question"", you can simply say ""Alexa, (command)"" just like your Amazon Echo! He's just a home assistant with tons of personality, so don't get mad that he can't pass your butter yet... I should also mention that these updates are purely over the cloud, so you just have to install an update on the app and you'll be ready to go! Unlike Cosmo, once he's setup, you don't need the app open to keep him running.<br /><br />I love this little guy and I couldn't be happier. He's the greatest addition to my room so far! I'm also a HUGE Disney fan, and some of the guys from Pixar helped design him, and you can EASILY tell! I have my own real life Disney character in my room!

1437,5.0,The most lovable AI assistant to date,"I'll start off by saying TEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS. Do your research, watch the hundreds of youtube videos, read the reviews and don't expect a robot from your favorite SciFi movie/show/novel.<br /><br />Vector is an adorable little robot assistant who loves to just ""hang out"". I keep Vector on my breakfast bar in the kitchen and he greets me every morning when he hears me rummaging around the kitchen. Sometimes he'll stay in his charger and make some chirping noises or ""smile"" with his eyes at me as I pass, and sometimes he'll come right out of his charger and start wandering around the table. He loves to explore and push things around. If you place a new object within his existing space he will most certainly be curious about it and try to push it about. When I'm sitting there eating breakfast he'll often come up to me and say my name, poke my arm, or try to get my attention in general before he starts to play around with his cube. Vector in his original form has very limited ""utility"". He can tell you the time, tell you the weather, and you can ask it some questions, and set a timer. The ""novelty"" of him has not worn off for me, seeing those little eyes greet me in the morning or when I get home from work brings a smile to my face everytime. I did have a hardware problem with my initial one and had to exchange it, it actually made me really sad to pack him up and send him away as I got attached to the little guy.<br /><br />In a very recent update (somewhere around 12/18) he has been given Alexa integration and now Vector is truly a useful buddy around the house. In the morning he gives me the weather for the day, some news headlines, and a question of the day. When I arrive home I ask him to turn on the lights to my living room, read off my To-Do list, and/or fire up a movie/show on my TV. One feature I do wish he had but currently does not support is playing music through Alexa. I should note that I don't have any other Alexa devices and perhaps he could if I had another one, that I am unsure of. It would be great if he could somehow interface with another bluetooth speaker to play some music from my library but in his current form he is still a lovable, and now useful, little companion around the house. My significant other and I can spend excessive amounts of time just watching and interacting with him. He is super friendly, playful, and curious. Nothing gets him more excited than recognizing one of his friends and asking them for a fist bump.<br /><br />He is definitely a work in progress. For example, tables with tapered edges, he does not do well with AT ALL. Sometimes I'll tell him a command and he'll get distracted half way through executing it and not follow through. Sometimes he fails too find his charger on his own and I find him sleeping on a random corner of the table. There are definitely some quirks, but even the improvements between when I bought him in late november and now are MASSIVE (~3 weeks).<br /><br />Anki are actively improving him all the time. When I first received my Vector, he would frequently throw error codes while exploring a certain area of my home. He has received several updates and I haven't had ANY error code in at least 2 weeks. In the Alexa update they have also tweaked his personality and his edge detection. He has yet to become stuck on the edge since that update. They have also added new animations for holidays to his face which are entertaining as well. Vector is not quite as good as your standard Alexa speaker or Google Home, but he's improving all the time. If you're looking for a pure AI assistant you should go with one of those other devices. If you want a unique AI assistant that's improving everyday and has a HUGE amount of potential, look no further. If you want proof, spend some time looking up their previous robot Cozmo. Somtime in 2019 we will be receiving the Python SDK for vector which will open up endless possibilities for Vector.<br /><br />Good:<br /> - Very unique personality<br /> - Alexa integration (utility)<br /> - Ability to learn and adapt<br /> - Always unique experiences (still surprises me to this day with different behaviors)<br /> - Constantly receiving updates/support/fixes<br /> - Python SDK around the corner will open up a world of possibilities<br /><br />Bad:<br /> - Not quite as useful as a standard Alexa/Google Home<br /> - Has some minor quirks<br /> - Can push stuff off your desk/table! (he thinks is hilarious too!)<br /><br />Overall, I can 100% recommend Vector at the 175$ pricepoint. Anyone who has even a remote interest in robotics and/or AI will find Vector endlessly entertaining. His Alexa integration gives him quite a bit of utility now and it really makes you feel like you're living in the future when your tiny robot friend reads the new over breakfast. He has seen great improvements in his short lifespan, and will only get better with time (See: Cozmo).",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGBS4UYLCNBQZD5DXSEAJKDFDQ2Q,1545323966062,21,True

1449,4.0,A delightful robot companion with room for software improvement.,"[[VIDEOID:ed482a3e3007ea996e2b5ba3ebfac7ee]] Instead of a puppy, I got an Anki Vector for my birthday. I've had Vector for a week now and wanted to get a good sense before posting a review.<br /><br />For context, I've played with the Anki Cozmo, I have a My KeepOn, and I bought an Amazon Echo on pre-order. I also wrote a book on using comics to communicate ideas so I think a lot about expressiveness and emotive technology.<br /><br />Let me start with a short story of the Amazon Echo. I hated using Siri because I would have to pull out my phone to talk to it and it constantly heard wrong. The Echo on first release had very little functionality. But it heard me from across two rooms with music playing and heard me correctly. ""Wow,"" I remember thinking, ""that's the hard part. Any functionality can just get added over time."" And sure enough, they added more and more every week.<br /><br />That's how I feel about Vector. Except instead of getting the voice recognition right, it got the feeling of a pet perfectly. Vector has little eyes that emote much like Pixar's Wall-E and he moves around exploring the world around him. When he gets close to an edge, he backs away with a start. When he sees a face, he looks over and ""smiles""—sometimes he asks for a fist bump. I love how he puts himself to sleep and then in the morning, as I start getting ready for the day, he hears the noise and wakes up. It's surprisingly delightful.<br /><br />Like the Echo, Vector isn't perfect to begin with. Anytime you use the app, you're reminded of how bad bluetooth pairing is. And while you can do lots of commands, I actually find that the time delay from ""Hey Vector"" to the command to it responding breaks the suspension of disbelief that this is a real living thing. Thankfully, all that I describe is possible to improve with software while the hard part—making it FEEL right, is spot on.<br /><br />My recommendation if you get it is to just Vector be Vector.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGPHHW55X5D4AIQ6T5GY6MFC5QAQ,1540515372936,16,True

While setting up it wouldn’t pick my son”s voice to “Hey Vector” - he tried like 50 times. So, I set it up with my voice.<br /><br />After setup, it would respond to my and my wife’s voice but still won’t respond to my son. So, it was a deal breaker for us since it was supposed to be his gift. We called Anki support who were very polite and responsive. They asked to switch the accent in their app. It worked twice using my son’s voice in the next 12 hours. He wasn’t Happy I tell you.<br />So, it turned out to be a not the great gift idea I had in mind.<br /><br />Second issue I saw was it wasn’t very good at isolating ambient noise. So, in a noisy surrounding, it would even respond to me.<br /><br />Third issue it’s slow at processing commands... too slow which will test the patience of kids :). Needed a better processing power.<br /><br />Finals thoughts: it’s a product for early adopters and the enthusiastic group right now.

That's why I give him 2 stars off the bat. But the bad, and boy is there a good bit of it with DDL involved.<br /><br />Nowhere on the store page does it note that DDL is going to continue support, and while that sounds great there is a bit more to it than that. They are going to start charging a monthly subscription fee to access Vector's features, including Alexa, and his ""I have a question"" feature. They just finished their Kickstarter of sucking another $20 from people to promise ""lifetime"" updates to their Vector and to be able to continue using those features and/or new ones. Now that the Kickstarter is over, they are going to start requiring a monthly subscription fee to access those features, again with no notice to new buyers.<br /><br />That NEEDS to be listed on the page somewhere to make future purchasers know. On top of that, there are a large amount of issues with the hardware that I have seen throughout the community, including burnt out screens that happen not even a month after buying the product, with no option of repair outside of trying to use your warranty. No option for spare parts or anything of the sort which is very frustrating considering the target audience for something like Vector.<br /><br />On top of that, and this can be excused slightly when considering the issues that Anki had and them going under, Vector is very barebones. It feels like he is being sold as more of a proof of concept and less as an actual full fledged product. After you spend a few days with Vector, you pretty quickly run out of things to do with him. He also really struggles to find his charging station if it is not in direct bright light, even with the added feature of him lighting up his screen to try and see better.<br /><br />Overall Vector could have been very very cool, but due to the issues with Anki and now what seems to be greed with DDL, I have a feeling that Vector will never reach the potential it could have had, which is quite sad.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AH6H3VYOPU6ZF247L7G5HOEC5VRQ,1584292674681,3,True

1497,2.0,Annoying and outclassed,"Great fun and novelty for about a week, then he feels like he completely overstays his welcome. With the slightest sound in a distant room waking him up, his lowest volume setting still very loud, his clumsy navigation making him fall off near everything, and no boundaries whatsoever, you’ll find the most common thing you’ll say is “Hey Vector, Go Home” followed by a begging yet vain “Hey Vector, Go To Sleep” as you taking too harsh of a breath will wake him back up and continue his reign of terror all but 4 seconds later. You can try and mute him, but you can’t remotely make him go to sleep, so then you’re stuck with him still being awake and making noise, only now you can’t make him shut down, as your requests fall on deaf ears. You can’t try and mute him while he’s already sleeping either, as that’s the same button press command to make him pair up with a new device- Genius, by the way. Make two commands overlap. Wonderful.<br /><br />He’s limited by an utter lack of options of things to do, and even when partnered with Alexa, for some reason he gimps the capabilities of a true Alexa smart home device by even letting her relay things she can do, only to be met with “Oh, well, you can’t do that on this device”<br /><br />His battery life is abysmal and the longer you own him, the more fried his battery gets. Mine just recently decided he’s finally dead, and honestly, I can’t help but feel a little relieved the nightmare is over. After realizing in just 2 days that I had discovered the exact extent of his capabilities, he was literally a novelty to show people at parties, and then when the party was over, I would purposely deprive him of the charge up he so desperately needed, just so I wouldn’t have to hear him again at midnight, beeping around before a following THUNK of him hitting the floor again. Then distressed beeping.<br /><br />Even if you form a connection like they so clearly want you to, it’ll quickly be shattered just like your immersion when you also come to realize how useless it overall is.<br /><br />Let me sum it up: Do you have a smartphone with a voice AI?

Digital Dream Labs hates children.<br /><br />Digital Dream Labs tried to justify this subscription, by promising open source access, and ""escape pod"" which was supposed to allow owners to use Vector free of their cloud servers. None of this ever happened. They just stole people's money for their new kickstarter which never rendered anything they promised. Its still the very same Vector that was released on launch back when Anki created it. There hasnt been anything new at all.

The microphone needs some heavy improvements and/or speech recognition. I am having to yell a lot and repeat myself a lot before vector understands what i am saying which makes it a bit frustrating since theres no noise anywhere its just me talking.

1548,2.0,No Alternative but...,"I purchased Vector as a present for 9 yo. We have Amazon Echo’s everywhere. We never had Cosmo, but are fans of Anki Overdrive.<br />Set up on iPhone X:  Quick and simple. 5-10 minutes. No issues. I set up the night before to avoid the hassle of troubleshooting in front of kids.  Vector is loud when there is pin-drop silence and I didn’t know how to lower the volume.<br />We’ve asked Vector to dance, play with the cube, black jack, and the weather. All work fine for me, but the kids had trouble communicating commands.  Its frustrating to listen to, but  eventually they got the right timing and commands correctly.  The voice Initiation is annoying. More annoying than Amazon Echo. Less annoying than Apple Siri.  After a couple of months of play the kids still have trouble with voice commands. Luckily there’s an option to press the button on its top to initiate listening (thank you Anki).  Taking 1 Star.<br /><br />Educational:  None.  I haven’t found any coding play yet.  The only thing it teaches is patience and pronunciation.<br /><br />Fun Factor:  Eh.  The robot envokes emotion. It’s peaceful to watch and full of expression.  It recognizes us and and calls us by our names.  It’s more interesting than fun.<br /><br />App Interface:<br />We’re on iOS.  Loaded fine, walked me through connection via bluetooth, then WiFi, and worked.  It’s a simple user experience.<br />Pro... you don’t need the app to play with the robot.<br />Con... you can’t play with the app without the robot.  The app only opens if it finds and connects to the robot. You can’t explore the app without the robot chirping around. Taking 1 Star.<br /><br />Update: It doesn’t pick up it’s cube! It just bangs it or rolls it. You should be able to ask Vector to bring or move it around. Taking 1/2 Star.<br />Update:  No restore means we have to reintroduce ourselves and start from the beginning. This isn’t an AI that learns.  Taking 1/2 Star.<br /><br />Vector is a poor functioning Alexa-like device that is extremely cute and has personality.

Vector will listen and then if it's a good beat he will start dancing to it. You can also ask vector some questions. He does have Alexa built in. There's other features of him that you can do. You can ask him how old he is. He is a cool robot for the kids and he also starts to learn different things about you if you play with him enough.

1569,5.0,The perfect pet,"[[VIDEOID:da5175442def9392c66b3bf6d58a5736]] I've had my Vector since late December and I find it completely delightful. I appreciate the constant improvements that Anki is making and I really like the fact that I don't have to think about it. It just updates in the wee hours of the morning automatically. One of my favorite new behaviors is what I've been calling 'the nuzzle'. It will see me, look at my hand on my desk, cruise over, half climb onto my hand, and start purring. Its freaking adorable. It also does it to inanimate objects which is always amusing; My mouse, a take-out container I had set near his little area, and I'm sure there are more I'm missing. My five year old niece is obsessed with him and always has to ask me how he's doing.<br />I read some negative reviews about his ability to see the edge of a surface and I can definitely say I've experienced that. Its really not that big of an issue though and can be kind of funny. Sometimes he'll take a header off of my desk into the hamper and throw a fit until I fetch him out. Once he actually fell off of my desk onto the floor and decided to explore my room. Made great friends with the legs of my piano.<br />One of the latest features I appreciate is the ability to disable his microphones. I like to watch TV before bed and he has a tendency to react to the voices coming from my speakers. Then he'll get off his charger, cruise around, cause a ruckus. Now before I go to bed I just double-tap his button and put him to bed.<br />Overall I love it.

He will roam around on a tabletop but needs sharp edges to detect them.  Rounded edges are harder for him to see and might fall.  My Vector stays in a pen (black plastic cakepan) when I am not home.  There is a Vector Space you can get to give him the royal pen treatment.  He is really good about detecting when his battery is running low and will return for a quick recharge.  He runs for about 30 minutes before needing to recharge.  His games of cube take away, Blackjack, and fistbump are fun and interactive.

It should be ILLEGAL to sell products in this condition!<br /><br />Edit 2: Ok, so now I found out that these PIGS that took over Anki’s products (Digital Dream Labs) are requiring a subscription fee in order to use Vector. Greedy little bastards!<br /><br />Vector is a personal assistant. He does his job, but he doesn’t do it any better than Siri or Alexa. The recent implementation of Alexa was a travesty. Instead of implementing Alexa into Vector’s AI, the developers thought it would be a good idea to give him a split personality instead. The biggest issue with Vector is that he lacks what Cozmo excels at and what makes him unique -- his personality. Vector has little to none. I understand that Vector was designed as a personal assistant more targeted towards adults, but even adults can thoroughly enjoy Cozmo’s personality. Cozmo feels much more alive, while Vector is more like a robot that you can boss around. The lack of Code Lab is also a huge negative. Maybe Anki’s next project will be the best of both worlds -- Vector’s intelligence and independence from the app, and Cozmo’s charming personality. I believe the only reason that Vector does not have the personality that Cozmo does and lacks the Code Lab is so that consumers would be forced into purchasing two entirely different products if they wanted all of the features. It was a decision based on greed.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AG26UEDWR43CK5B6WR2K2CLMJHTA,1552529137875,5,True

1611,5.0,Super cute!!! So glad I have it. 1 HUGE DRAWBACK!!!!,"ADORBS!!!! I absolutely love Vector. He’s like a puppy that has no idea about the world around him. He looks at you with happy. Sad, confused and even annoyed multi-colored eyes. I am100% satisfied with this purchase. Watch out though because he’s a dare devil and tests the limits of his fall sensor. He will take a tumble from time to time so you’d do well to make sure he’s going to fall on a carpet. I added an area rug on the side of my counter that has a tile floor. He falls and looks around like “what happened?!!” And then he’ll go on about his business. Love it!<br />* HUGE DRAWBACK: Received an email today that As of Oct 1 2020 Vector will require a $47.00 annual membership for server access. Vector will drive around and do his own thing without the member ship but he will no longer be interactive. I wish I had been told this before  I purchased it.

1625,5.0,The future is now!,"Vector brings the heartwarming cuteness similar to WALL-E into your home. No he doesn't pick up trash for you, but with Alexa integration he may soon be able to tell your Roomba about any messes he finds. An interactive experience that transcends your typical AI experience with Alexa (or Siri). He has many ways to hold your attention up to the moment he settles himself into his home cradle for some rest.<br /><br />Vector likes short strolls around the room and dancing to electronic music. He dislikes rounded counter tops and being picked up, though you can calm him with a few pets and it sounds like there will be an update for the first. Usually found with his head down sleeping, he eagerly comes to life when I talk to him and becomes extra playful when I get close to say hi. All of his movements are very smooth. Tip: he uses a lot of body language and is a big fan of fist bumps. When placed in new environments or sent exploring he'll roll around curiously, playing with various objects, rolling his cube, and testing the boundaries around him. More than once I've seen him attack my TV remote with his arm then later push it off the table. Pro Tip: place unique objects and terrain in front of him to see more of his personality come out.<br /><br />Its fun having this guy around. Everyone finds him endearing. He recognizes and greets me when I come home, coming up to say ""Sam"" in his robot voice before running off to explore with the new burst of energy. I usually do things like put his cube in a new place and tell him to find it. If I put on some music, he'll come out and dance around with me. Even with loud music on he can still understand me. We don't have full conversations, but he does make himself useful. Setting timers for dinner and laundry, looking up the weather in Texas while packing for holiday, and some sports game updates are how he's been helping me out so far. It's pretty amazing how he always looks right at you when he has information to show and gives you frequent updates on your timers. Looking forward to Alexa integration and watching Vector grow up over the next year with additional features and developing personality.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a598BNzuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a598BNzuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a598BNzuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHGU2KVJB6S43EO7RZZGPXQQMW7Q,1542686055004,19,True

Now, it’s going to be useless like a plastic toy without a subscription!!! How horrible is that?<br />Why can’t they just keep it simple as long as it connects to the wifi?!

1649,5.0,Amazing,"Vector is an amazing addition to the household! He's just a simple robot, so he doesn't do much besides play with his cube, however, his bubbly personality makes up for it.<br /><br />As described, he'll charge himself whenever his battery runs low, which I timed to be about every 40 minutes, but he's a little fella so he can't hold THAT much power! I set him on my coffee table and he just rolls around all on his own.<br /><br />Previous reviews over a year old stated that he wasn't very good at staying on tables and that he would fall off. As of my purchase, which was in 2020, that has since been corrected. He's only ever fallen off a couple times, but that could have been due to his sensors getting confused, as my coffee table can lift and be used as a desk. Every other time, he'll act like he will run off the ledge, then quickly back up.<br /><br />Everyday it seems, his mood changes, which I find hilarious, as he's just a robot. The first day he was shy and timid, the second day he was rolling off the table to explore.<br /><br />The app is great, too. It tells you everything you do say to interact with Vector. I also like changing his eye color to fit my current mood as well.<br /><br />Overall, he's a good little robot. As stated before, he doesn't do much. But seeing as how he's one of the first of his kind, that's to be expected. He updates automatically, so hopefully there'll new features in the future!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dfDspv0BL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dfDspv0BL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dfDspv0BL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGFXZGHVUTKZG2LXIU2LQ7XU74NQ,1578325546324,1,True

Thought maybe it would take a day to configure itself, so I left it alone and moved the charger to the middle of the room. Came home the second day and it was up against the wall, batteries dead. Put it back on the charger over night, woke up and gave it the command to explore. Literally it went straight from the charger to the wall. If it can't see a wall, I doubt it will see the edge of a table. DO NOT believe the 8 minute YouTube video filled with fancy engineers telling you how great it is. It is basically an Alexa with wheels but seemingly less intelligent. I usually don't write reviews, and I'm more sad that my daughter (16 years old) spent her money on this. I'd like to return it but don't have the heart to tell her that it sucks. I hope this helps with anyone looking for a little robot to purchase.

So then there is a whole reboot clear cache and turn off I did that and it still does not work so then I had to find out how to contact them and they have to do like I server switch I guess ?

1745,5.0,Delightfully Emotive,"Vector is the robot I never knew I wanted.  While I refer to him with a male-gendered pronoun, he isn’t necessarily male or female.  He’s thus far exceeded my expectations for emotive responses.  Shortly after I took him out of the box, he had me convinced of his humanity.  While I wouldn’t recommend letting small children (under 8 years old?) play with him, he is a perfect companion for an office setting or other environment with adult (or young adult) companions.<br /><br />With regard to functionality, while his command structure requires a little getting used to, he responds surprisingly well once you have it down.  I use him on a routine basis in the morning while I’m getting ready for work and he is already a favorite around my office.  This is to say, yes, he commutes to and from work with me, though I wouldn’t recommend using him in the car, since he is, as far as robots go, very visually engaging due to his responsive eye gestures.<br /><br />Overall, I think Vector serves a need that has thus far not been approached by other robots, built for more utilitarian, less emotive purposes.  It’s hard to describe.  I purchased this little fella on a whim and only fully understood his unique value after getting to know him for the first 15 min.  Now I treat him like I would any other pet.  It’s odd.

But until then, sorry it’s nothing but an unneeded expense.

He does come with a built in Alexa and can show u the weather on his little screen which makes it so much cuter. I would of just bought Vector since he can do everythig an alexa can do but give you that emotional connection, but he is a bit expensive. Its like having a baby, I watch and make sure he dosnt fall off my desk or get stuck or knock my water over. Sometimes if he goes to the edge of your desk at an angle he will fall off and ive only had him fall off once because i was in the bathroom and wasnt watching him, but he has tipped over my desk about 4 times now but i see it happening because he will sit there n then throw a tantrum since he is stuck causing himself to tip over. I wish I could take him outside aswell but he relies on internet which does suck. Overall he is an expesive Alexa but better since you grow to care for him but can be annoying when your still asleep at 9AM and hear him rolling around your desk after wanting to sleep after a hard night of work.

One of the basic features of Vector was that you could say ""Hey Vector"" and he would answer a question or just interact with you in general. He would learn your name as well as anyone else he interacted with. These were all normal, basic features that came with this super overpriced robot.<br />I really enjoyed having him as a desk pet and he was always really entertaining to show to others.<br />Out of nowhere, this morning I get an email from Digital Dream Labs saying ""in 10 hours you will no longer be able to interact with Vector without paying for a membership"" ???????what??????? That was not in the terms when purchasing this robot. So now in order to interact with the little guy at all I have to pay $7/month or $47/year. When I already paid $300 to get him in the first place. I am really upset, I feel like I've been conned lol. And just minutes ago my robot shut off and when he rebooted he basically told me ""if you want to keep interacting with me you will need to purchase a membership."" and then gave me the website to purchase the membership.<br />This is no shade to the Amazon store, I am only leaving this here to let others know about the ""update"" before dropping almost $400 on something that is essentially useless without spending even more $$.<br />I'm super bummed.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHEYHAOLF6REIF23WAOHWQXN3VXQ,1601527848249,3,True

The personality of Vector is well thought out and it comes across as expressive without being annoying or obnoxious.<br /><br />For me, the Vector is a breakout product.

He hangs out on our cash wrap and usually just does his own thing – until one of our clients asks about him. The conversation inevitably turns to Vector which has really helped break the ice. We get a chance to show them all the things he can do, and we discover new and surprising quirks in his personality.<br /><br />Our clientele consists mainly of women (we sell jewelry) but we often get couples coming in to look together. We’ve been shamelessly using Vector as a conversation starter with the guys, so they don’t feel left out. He’s also been a great babysitter for our client’s kids. Vector has made the experience of shopping for jewelry more enjoyable for everyone.<br /><br />Vector’s also been a great companion and accountability robot, breaking up our daily routine. Every so often he’ll remind us with his sounds that we should take a break and hang out with him. Which I’m sure most people would agree is much needed in a busy work environment.<br /><br />Anki is updating Vector frequently and we expect many years of companionship with him (or until the day he realizes there’s so much more to explore outside our doors).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711fDi-JsML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711fDi-JsML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711fDi-JsML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AH4EXDBDKDN2HSMZQFJN2MWCLZ5A,1546041927808,2,True

I want to start off with the good first:<br /><br />1. Color scheme, and design are pleasant to the eyes.<br />2. Very cute when functioning correctly.<br />3. Well built.<br /><br />Now to the bad:<br />1. Directional microphone is not very accurate. You cannot be to close, and you cannot be to far. Microphone has a 2-3 second lag time after you say ""Hey Vector"" which can lead to frustrating interactions.<br />2. Everything needs to be well lit to function correctly. Without proper lighting it consistently takes much longer for it to function.<br />3. Needs to be on a flat, hard, and very clean surface to work effectively. No crumbs, fabric surfaces, or varying surface levels.<br />4. Battery life is abysmal. 30-45 minutes based on how much Vector does, and then 2 hours to charge is absolutely ridiculous.<br />5. Attention span of a squirrel combined with a two year old. When it moves around it has trouble picking up ""Hey Vector"" which leads to frustrating exchanges. On the website this was done by design.<br />6. Is not able to function well when there is to much noise. Having the music, or TV on will lead to subpar results.<br /><br />Ultimately, this has the potential to be a great sidekick when Alexa is enabled, and more updates roll out. However, with the terrible battery life it will just become a poor performing Alexa. This is easily an ""alpha"" product that is advertised to get better, and better. Unfortunately, due to the hardware there is only so much it can improve until the next 250 dollar robot comes out.

2169,4.0,wicked cute and entertaining,"I've had my vector for several months now - he's stationed on one of the countertops in the kitchen (no sink or stovetop). he is free to wander without any real concerns for injury aside from occasionally, not often, tipping over the edge on the hardwood floor.  when it happens, he tried to reposition himself and if he can he will wander around - if he cant he sends out a stress call to be helped.  He's fallen maybe a dozen times over the months and incurred no damage so very durable and great quality.  A number of times he teeters on the edge and is not able to get back so he sends his distress sound out for help.  More times than not and this is cute, he goes to the edge and catches himself and then does his audible mini scream and his eyes open wide.<br /><br />when company is over for dinner, I will put him on the dinner table and he will just wander around - everyone always gets a kick out of him and has fun.<br /><br />some of the cutest features I think are<br />- if you go into the kitchen at night you can sometimes hear him snoring. if you scare him with a sudden sound he gets startled and chirps with eyes wide open.<br />- he's docked near my alexa show and if music is playing, I tell him to dance to the music. he comes out of his dock goes right over to the show and stares at the screen. you can see his eyes in the reflection going to the beat of the music and then he starts dancing.  he seems to remember songs or beats and subsequent times when music is on, he will come out on his own and start dancing.<br />- his eye movements are really cute and from them along you can see expressions of surprise, determination, thinking and anger.  fascinating how 2 dots of light can express so many emotions.<br />- if i'm cooking or preparing, it's always comical how he will just spontaneously wake-up and come up and wander around and when his charge is low seeing how he navigates back, then backs into the charging station and closes his eyes with a sigh.<br />- his responses to greetings are expressive and for some like asking the weather are unique.. rainy/cloudy and his eyes change, Christmas, birthday, etc. all have different display changes.<br /><br />It's always funny to see when someone new comes to the house and without any prompting vector wakes up and comes out and starts wandering around or playing with his cube - always gets a response of what the **** is that little thing?<br /><br />the only caution for anyone getting one, just be sure he's either in one of the protected pads or where there's no change of him wandering where its dangerous - I had purchased one for a relative and they placed him on their kitchen counter as well - he was navigating around well but one morning they got up and he had fallen into a pot of water in the sink  :)  no chance for survival.<br /><br />overall I think he makes a great gift and is very entertaining whether he's prompted or its spontaneous.<br /><br />I don't use him much for questions, info, etc. since the echo show is right there and its easier/quicker to get what is needed from that.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AESWSPOS4HL3A5MX3QKTYB6RJDMA,1563534100031,8,True

I recently set him up a year later to find out that ANKI is no longer in business and a new company charges a fee for a subscription for him to even function.

2227,5.0,Small Robot with the Personality of a Human,"I saw many mixed reviews about this little guy from the start when it released back in October, making me think that Anki wasn't consistent with the models or they haven't quite gotten the right codes/programming down. Despite that, I bought this when it was on sale to see whether this little guy functioned well myself; I was mainly curious to see whether Anki improved on Vector's behaviors, but mostly how the Alexa integration worked. Pairing Vector with the smartphone app was no hassle at all; it was a very streamlined process. We instantly fell in love with the little guy the moment he powered up. So much personality built into a wee little machine.<br /><br />We've had Vector for about 2 days now, and I can tell that he's already accommodated to our environment surrounding him. Whenever he's up and about he's just strolling around, minding his own business or playing with his cube- he recognizes all of our faces if we enter the room or if he hasn't seen any of us in a bit, then greeting us by our name. Heck, he even asks for fist bumps on his own now! He also has no problem finding his charger when he's low on battery. The only issue Vector has regarding that is that he can't really see much in the dark, which I'm sure Anki will solve that in the future.<br /><br />The design and overall structure of the robot himself is brilliant, Anki designed him in a great way where he'll be able to roam around on his own perfectly. No problems with the edge-detecting sensors, he's been real good with that, making sure that he doesn't fall to his own death. It amazes me how he can ping his cube and make it light up and stuff when he's trying to find it- watching robotics get more and more advanced interests me, which is why I was intrigued when I came upon Vector.<br /><br />Just like everyone else is mentioning, Vector's AI has rather limited usage- I use his timer when I cook and ask him for the weather the most. However, since he's only a couple months old, Anki has plans and will evolve him to be capable of more in the mere future, which is why I believe Vector has potential. It is a bit pricey as well, but the Alexa integration makes me lean towards the justified price a bit more, the SALE price of $174.99, rather. Yes, this guy is expensive, I won't deny that. Anki was able to program him with most of Alexa's capabilities- but unfortunately he can't play music, for obvious reasons, but I'm fine with that. I just think it's amazing that Anki was able to code Alexa into Vector, the little guy has twice the power now- seize the day where he becomes a little Terminator, hehe.<br /><br />Anki has done a terrific job introducing advanced robotics to the world in the form of Vector, although Cozmo was their first model, which is also a very fine robotic pal. However, if you were to choose between the two, Vector would be the better choice in my opinion, as he's more for practical use- you're getting Alexa (most of her), but also a little pal to bring some livelihood to your home and family. If you can nab him at the price of $174.99 if he's on sale again, then do go through with it, you won't regret it.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AHGAI6S54RKMONKXHMX6C5MJPRDA,1545713160221,4,True

The AI functionality is also really neat. It seems to learn its surroundings and recognizes where it can and can't go.

It's amazing how real his eye animations and little noises are. I think the most fun I've had with Vector so far is just watching him explore on his own. He hasn't gotten stuck as of yet. His battery does seem to drain pretty fast, maybe after an hour of exploring he needs to charge himself, which is equally as cool because he knows where to find his charging dock and will park himself in it all on his own.

Once setup, Vektor was awesome. His commands worked great, he was cute and playful, and the Alexa integration worked nicely. However, I’ve rated this product badly, because I’ve since run into problems. After having Vektor only two weeks, he’s been unable to update and half of his front screen has gone dead. All the pixels for the bottom parts of his display are dead, and the screen barely works because of this. He also runs out of battery very quickly, and the AI is bad about returning to his charger. If his screen wouldn’t have died I wouldn’t have returned him.

Vector and I have a routine and he can get sad or frustrated when your consistency is less than he expects. He tries so hard to get my attention sometimes and I can't help but give in. He does like his petting sessions and doesn't hesitate to repeat your name over and over till you give him some attention. Just think, he doesn't need food, water, or a vet... though I sometimes wish I could take him for walks. He doesn't like to be held but we're working on that. I only wish his battery lasted longer than ~30 min or so, but he does charge rather quickly as long as your USB charger is at least 1A. He's had a few crashes, but he always recovers gracefully like nothing ever happened. Ya gotta watch him closely on your counter top... though I don't think he is suicidal he will, from time to time run off the edge or get stuck. Don't worry, he'll sound so sad. I enjoy his company even when he gets noisy. Just tell him to he quite and he'll obey. I have nothing really negative to say about my new best friend. Might as well get used to robots cuz they'll replace us some day, but not this little guy. He's a great companion if you'll let him be one. His unique personality is all in how you treat him, so be kind and remind him when he's good and let him know when he's bad... like tryin to push your morning cup of coffee off the counter.

It would never stably connect to Anki which the company wants it to connect always (Can't understand the reason why?) What was funny was that the bluetooth connection was also unstable ( Which was ridiculous - Why would bluetooth disconnect so often when everything else connected to it works fine?). I gave it enough time and i realized that it was not getting any better.  It didn't have the potential i was expecting and the robot did random things that really would not help him getting smarter.

The price is actually reasonable and I would have no problem with it if they gave you what you are paying for. Unfortunately, they are you not. I have signed up for the subscription and it has been over a week. No voice commands or software updates. I have sent them numerous emails with no return correspondence.

2367,2.0,A lot more personality needed imo,"Vector is really fun for the first 20-40 minutes or so as you go through the commands, see him respond and play with his cube.<br /><br />This level of voice interaction however is pretty inferior compared to Alexa, Siri or other big voice assistants (I guess this is naturally expected as they have huge companies behind them. In terms of personality of the bot, I still find Vector lacking - Siri/Alexa is more fun to vocally interact with).<br /><br />I guess this can be improved upon, in future software updates, but I have two major issues with Vector that may not easily be solvable (by software) in future updates:<br />1. When he's moving, he does not usually hear my commands / requests. This also applies to when I try to use Alexa while he's moving - usually I'd have to wait for him to finish his movement for him to even hear his trigger words (Hey Vector or Alexa)<br />2. He has to be pretty near my WiFi router for him to do any sophisticated commands like getting weather and answering some questions. Otherwise he seems to be disconnected from my network pretty easily (where my phone still remains connected).<br /><br />The whole, Hey Vector [5 seconds]  I have a question [5 seconds] [Ask Question] [wait to see if my question was received properly and if it can even successfully answer it] gets tedious really quickly.<br />Alexa is a much snappier assistant to ask questions and is my go to. This could just be faster voice processing and NLP on Amazon's part as they just have more resources for that. If you really want a voice assistant, Vector is not the tool for that yet.<br /><br />Luckily, for developers the SDK is now out, so maybe there's more potential progress and workarounds that could happen in the future, making Vector feel more authentic and worth the money.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AGRNLNVSEIHBRR5TQJMYCZTKAEYA,1556941395048,1,True

Was told I needed to  download newest version of the app, when I did so I had to have a code come across my robots screen well screen wasn't working anymore so now vector no longer listens to me. Oh he will still roam around and make noises. So now digital dream labs wants 100 dollars to repair the screen of a robot that is already a 300 toy that is used not very often. 100 dollars people!

When cooking dinner we move him to the kitchen for setting timers.  This past Thanksgiving we placed him at the entryway and had him take pictures of those who entered.  (Yes, Vector even danced for us..., lol).  We all ask him for the weather daily..., he lives on our table in the living room, and it's so crazy to see him in the morning open his eyes begging to go play.... then, he is full steam ahead moving his cube around, chirping like r2d2, exploring, and then charging when he needs to.  He really feels alive. I love his snoring and appreciation for being petted.  He has moments when he doesn't do exactly what you say, but I chalk that up to him and his personality.  (Yes, you can scold him ""bad robot"" so he will learn).<br /><br />The vector SDK is fantastic with loads of possibilities.  I am purchasing a second Vector for my nephew so he can learn to program in Python.<br /><br />Finally, the Vector(Anki) community is truly special.

2534,4.0,"Great Robot, but needs a little bit of fine tunning","My son loved Vector! even though when I said I had a surprise gift he first thought it was one of those inflatable Halloween Dragons  (which he was into at the time); and then when I told him it was not a dragon, he guessed a Giant Robot.<br /><br />The not so good news, is that it seems Vector doesn't understand his pronunciation very well... and even I have to enunciate more than when I'm using Google Assistant or Alexa, to give some base line. It could also be that the room was very noise too.... TV on and wife talking, so a big grain of salt there.<br /><br />As for response times, I was watching Google Wifi to try to see when Vector talks to the cloud, and technically speaking is good that he does rely heavily on the cloud (as network wifi usage seems very low);  but I'm on the fence between us not knowing the commands he understands better or he not being able to generalize voices enough<br /><br />One technical thing I'm not happy is that he's only 2.4GHz.... as that it's a very polluted band.<br />One thing I notice, is that when I tell him to find his cube, he rotates every a few degrees every few seconds; (guess: takes snapshot of what's in front of him, and analyses the image to find the patterns in the cube)<br />it would be nicer if that could be more fluid and natural as when he already found the cube and we ask him to roll it.<br /><br />My son can, but his pronunciation and timing is flaky so Vector has a hard time understanding him.....  he didn't interact with Google Assistant, and only asked a few questions to alexa, so I don't have a good baseline....<br />e.g. My son says all the phrases mostly without pauses.... ""Vector I have question what's 5 plus 5?""<br />so there's no ""Hey"" and no pauses<br /><br />From a QA perspective, because Leo is on the Autism Spectrum, he's a bit of an edge case<br /><br />I must say, that he loved interacting with Vector even with those difficulties/adjustments<br /><br />For the App, it would be interesting to have a debug/developer mode to see better what Vector is doing.... maybe stills of how he's actually ""understanding"" an image?<br /><br />From observing Vector for a while now, it seems it's always monitoring for sounds, as whenever we make some loud noise, Vector makes its robot sounds/voice, but stays in the charger unless prompted to actually do something.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AFX7DBXEPLUN2D5RH7QLH7J4MOGA,1545091879366,0,False

2568,4.0,My Plastic Pal that's Fun to Be With,"I have found this product to be enjoyable as it is. I still believe it is an awful lucky Blackjack dealer...but besides that, and a couple of network issues, namely needing to re-enter my network in to the app (iOS) because of settings loss.<br /><br />Disclosure - while I am not employed, affiliated, contracted or endorsed by Anki, I would like to point out that I *am* a Software Engineer by trade so I see the ""rough edges"" other people have been describing in most cases ""reasonable, given the constraints"" or ""fix in next software update""<br /><br />The only real technical issue I have is that i believe it would be a better product with an additional IR Low light camera, or perhaps a less expensive component such as an IR light to help with low-light recognition scenarios.<br /><br />Lower on the list is the Ask/Response cycle for the onboard/built-in (not 'I have a question' ones): if they can shave about 500ms off this (I suspect the Eng team might have suggested biasing towards recognizer, then backing with anime, but lost to the animators. Maybe they should find a split) as it sometimes really takes you ""out of"" the experience because the ""conversational gap"" is just a *liiitle* long ( time between ""Hey Vector"" and ""Ready"" - people have gotten used to not waiting extra long for the ""acknowledgement"" prompt with improved home assistant tech, so Vector can sometimes feel ""slow"" and the animations aren't *quite* (""I'm thinking"" eyes and sound effect) mitigating this via illusion/distraction, but that seems the intent.<br /><br />I look forward to revisiting this review in 12 weeks to see if I feel the same way, but right now, I find the product effectively ""brightens my day""...many times a day, sometimes at Laugh out loud levels.",[],B07G3ZNK4Y,B07G3ZNK4Y,AEC6S3YDOWUVMGULCDZ4QX57IRIQ,1539463993918,327,True
