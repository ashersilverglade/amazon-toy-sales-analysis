21,5.0,I really like using this game for play therapy.,"I've had this game in the office for three or four years now. I found it challenging to begin with and now, find it fairly easy, but still produce major crashes from time to time. The kids love it when I mess up! Most of the kids really like it. It challenges them to learn the rules (one hand only, you can't hang 2 pieces in the same spot) and helps deal with frustration tolerance and eye/hand coordination. It is too frustrating for some, but that still provides a learning experience and they get to help me with color ID (the blue and green spots on the die look alike to me).  I have noticed that the holes in the base have loosened up a lot over the years, so I may have to narrow them or drill some new holes. I like the one reviewer's suggestion of add-on pieces and different bases.  I am convinced this was invented by a couple of guys with a 12 pack and a bunch of wire coat hangers.",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AGNHBTHMXSDSFBMBYAT46MWFEEHA,1467923959000,2,True

I think we have played it the &#34;right&#34; way maybe five times but it's been pulled out and enjoyed a thousand times over. I *LOVE* this game because it can be played alone and used like a one-of-a-kind building set. It has gotten so much use the plastic tube it came in fell apart so now it has it's very own storage bin. When other children come over, it is something new they have never seen and they each enjoy manipulating the pieces to get them to balance or dangle just right. My son makes &#34;lightning rods&#34; and &#34;electrical lines&#34; with them and occasionally electrocutes nearby building block towers, completely demolishing them. (Boys!)

I could see a small child sticking that right in their ear or in the nose as well. But beside that, this game is impossible to play. Even we ADULTS could not get the pieces to balance. Worst purchase ever. Since two of these were mailed gifts, I'll replace those with something that is FUN, COMPLETE, and SAFE. The third one we are stuck with here. A waste of $41 plus tax.

558,4.0,A balancing Jenga-type dexterity game with funky metal rods,"COMPONENTS: I've always loved dexterity games, and this is a good one.  My game came in a long cylindrical plastic tube which contained a wooden base and metal frame that takes you 10 seconds to put together each time you play, 24 metal rods with rubber tips in 6 colours, a colour die, and an instruction sheet.<br /><br />SET-UP: First you assemble the wooden base with the four metal rods and wooden connector. Then the metal rods/pieces are shared out, each player getting the same number of each colour, and extras (if any) going to a draw pile.<br /><br />GAME-PLAY: The basic objective is to be the first player who gets rid of all their rods/pieces, by hanging them from the structure, taking turns to place one at a time, depending on what colour you roll on the die.  But there are some rules for placement: You can only use one hand when placing a piece. And once you let go and remove your hand - your turn is done. You can hang your piece anywhere, except on a notch or straight section already used by another piece. If after letting your piece go any other piece touches the ground, you need to reposition your piece. Finally, any pieces that fall during your turn, get added to your pile.<br /><br />LOOKS: Suspend has quality components, and is an attention-grabber when set up on the table or in play.  It's fun to play yourself, but also fun to watch others play.<br /><br />ACCESSIBLE: The beauty about a game like this is that anybody of any age or ability can play it.  The rules are easy to learn and understand, and you can be playing it 60 seconds after you've seen it for the first time.  Plus an entire game can be played in well under 10 minutes.<br /><br />DYNAMIC: Although Suspend shares something in common with Jenga at its raw level, the components have a very different look, and the way the balancing works is quite different. You are not working with a static tower, but the entire structure will move and change every time you play a piece. This makes it slightly less predictable and even harder to assess what will happen each time you add a piece, but it also makes it dynamic and exciting to watch and play.<br /><br />FUN: Anything that involves physically building something and watching it tumble down will create moments of tension (will it fall?), moments of drama (will he succeed?), moments of disaster (oh, it toppled!).  Moments like these that also create laughs and entertainment. The dynamic structure can create gasps as each piece is added and the entire structure swings and changes, and also moments of frustration when pieces tumble off or the entire thing falls over. It really is just a fun game!<br /><br />VARIANTS: The game comes with a few ways to play, but what it really needs are some good house rules and official variations, which can mitigate the frustration that can be caused by rolling the die.  Fortunately you'll find lots of good suggested house rules online that improve this, although for the average person this won't be an issue, given how quick and fun the game is.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: The central element that makes Suspend so much fun is the tense battle against momentum and gravity as you carefully position a new piece onto a swaying and volatile structure! The entertainment that this provides makes it very worth while.  There are some real strengths here in terms of accessibility and appeal, and the amount of fun that the game Suspend can produce for a wide range of people. For me Suspend is a keeper!<br /><br />- BoardGameGeek reviewer EndersGame",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AE4B34A4YU5TKBYGPZD2V4QWLODA,1518767589613,0,False

560,5.0,Surprise hit with adults!,"I host a small adult game night at a local theater. I purchased Suspend last holiday season and nearly a year later, no one had played it yet. (To be fair, we have dozens upon dozens of games to choose from.) A few weeks ago I was contemplating taking it out of the group of games I haul back and forth each night we play, since the cylindrical shape doesn't pack easily. I figured I'd take the already-packed box of games for November's final game night, then select new games and repack without Suspend.<br /><br />While one person was waiting for a game to join, he pulled out Suspend and started setting it up on the living room table, just to see what the game looked like. A card game ended and those players wandered into the room where Suspend was, and it was decided they'd all try and play a test game of it.<br /><br />For the next hour and forty-five minutes, the Suspend players had several raucous rounds of games going, and by the end of the night, everyone else had gathered around and the room was filled with so much cheering and bantering that it rivaled watching a football game! It was enough fun that several people pulled out their phones to add Suspend to their shopping cart right then and there.<br /><br />Most of the night was spent playing the basic games described in the rules, however we came up with some other game ideas to try another night, including turning it into a drinking game and also combining multiple sets and base points. One thing that contributed to the fun of the game was having it on a lower table that players could easily move around.<br /><br />This was a surprise hit with the adults, who compared it to a modern sort of ""Pick-up Sticks vs. Jenga"" game. I DO think it might be very challenging for younger kids, though I myself was a pre-STEM kid who probably would have enjoyed this right along with the chemistry and robotics sets I had in 2nd-4th grade.

The goal of this game is to hang rubber-tipped wire pieces from a stand that you construct, which is trickier than it sounds.<br /><br />I played the game with two of my children, ages five and seven.  (The recommended age is eight and up, but you can play with children younger than that, depending on the child and on the amount of help you give your child.)  My seven year-old got proficient with the game rather quickly, while my five year old needed a little help, but did well.<br /><br />We had fun for an afternoon, and as noted above, both of my kids rapidly got the ""hang"" of it (heh).  But other than the first day, they haven't wanted to play Suspend again.  I don't know if this is because they're a bit under the recommended age or if today's generation finds electronic toys more ""fun"".  I, however, had a great time with the game and was even playing it by myself.<br /><br />I applaud ""Melissa and Doug"" for making toys like this, where kids can learn real world skills, such eye-hand coordination and balance, while having fun doing it even though my brood didn't take to it as I had hoped.

You roll a little die that tells you which color bar you are supposed to play. This really keeps the game interesting and fun.  If you have already played a color and you roll the same color, you have to steal someone else's so that you make sure to play that color bar.

948,5.0,Fun game for the whole family,"WHY I BOUGHT IT:<br />I was looking for a game that I can play with both adults and children and doesn't require too much thinking.<br /><br />WHAT YOU GET:<br />You will receive a plastic tube containing 24 rods, 4 frame rods, a die, a wooden base, a wooden connector.<br /><br />HOW TO SET IT UP:<br />Setting up the game is very easy: you just need to stick 3 frame rods into the wooden base and then add a fourth one using the wooden connector.<br />Then you can distribute the metal rods, depending on how many people (up to 4) are going to play.<br /><br />HOW TO PLAY:<br />The rules are simple (there are variants if you want to make the game more challenging): you first roll the die and take a rod of the corresponding color; you will then have to add the rod to the structure with caution, so that it doesn't collapse. If any rods fall, they become yours.<br />The first player that remains without rods wins.<br /><br />THOUGHTS:<br />This game is very fun to play and it can entertain both adults and children.<br />I like that it doesn't take much space and is easy to carry around.<br />Moreover, the rods are very light, so you don't risk damaging your table.<br />The only, very minor thing, that could be improved is the fact that the black and blue colors on the die look very similar if you don't have a bright light source; after some time, you get used to it though.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JEQx7MDML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JEQx7MDML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JEQx7MDML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AHN62MVMO7OZ4GKEEJHJXNRVRWYA,1498940179730,0,True

So, rather than the staged complex  structures you see, in reality, you tend to stay stuck at the starting point. Rarely, adding more than two consecutive pieces before complete collapse. The game just doesn't have a good success/failure ratio to maintain interest. Don't believe me? Try to find any videos of anyone playing Suspend correctly with no video edits or without starting with a lot of pieces already in a staged setup. Due to this lack of continuity, playability, the game just feels like a futile exercise. Rather than being fun, my thoughts go towards, what would I rather be doing, returning it or gifting, but who would want it?<br /><br />I do believe the pieces could be redesigned to provide more hanging options for a greater success rate.

With that said, it’s a great game to play and has taught her patience, turn taking, and balance skills. The part I’m not happy about is the colors on the dice not matching the colors on the pieces, poor choice from the game makers. If your trying to teach colors you will confuse a younger child.

To put the game very simply, keep balancing rods on other rods until you run out. The first person to run out of rods is the winner. The canister has more detailed instructions and different ways to play.<br /><br />Simple, yes? Ha! More difficult than you think.

Once we got into it we had about two hours worth of fun in one sitting.  We moved from beginner to intermediate game within that time.  The basic idea is to take turns hanging pieces with multiple grooves on each other trying not to knock any off.  The first one to get rid of all their pieces wins.  Definitely more difficult than it sounds.  It takes practice and as you add more pieces the structure is constantly shifting, adding to the challenge.  This makes for unique game play every time, but also, as other reviewers have noted, you get a really cool looking piece of modern art. My only negative is that the die that comes with the game (for intermediate game play) has colors that can be difficult to distinguish.

Put together the 3 piece base (easy) then roll the die to see what color of metal piece you have to add.  Try not to let any fall!  Gets harder the more you add!  The one who uses their pieces up first is the winner.  Can also be played with only 1 person by trying to use all the metal pieces without making any fall.

While we got 30min of fun out of it, I got the impression there may be no more then 30min of fun to be had with this for the life of the game.<br /><br />I respect that some people think this is great.

1949,4.0,A Nice Addition to Game Night with Kids,"So our family has younger kids, and trying to find games that even the 3 year old can play came sometimes be challenging.  Our latest game is Jenga, which now that we have used Suspend has very similar qualities which is probably why they like this too.  This game comes in a (flimsy) plastic tube that can somewhat be resealed, if you open it carefully on top.  Definitely the container could have been made more durable.  Then the pieces are made of medal, wood and a bit of plastic.  The general goal of the game is to balance as many of the pieces as you can, but if any of them fall on your turn, you take the pieces.  The person with the least pieces at the end wins.<br /><br />I do like that they outline in the instructions the different ways of playing, from beginner to intermediate.  In a lot of ways, you could make up your own versions of that depending on the number of people playing and the skill level.  I also highly recommend that if you have kids older than 7 you allow them to play by themselves a few times as well.  Gives them some strategies they can use once they join a group.<br /><br />I think the price is right on this one, but again, I probably would have paid a bit more for a descent case for this.",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AGIS3QL3LUEQWKF3YKHLLWDD5BJA,1341526809000,0,False

We played it 3 or 4 times at my request as my son knew after the first time that he didn't like it. I thought we should give it a chance. First, the game is actually quite large once it's set up. It might be better to try playing it on a linoleum floor rather than on a table top. Every time one of us would try to place a piece, all the wires would crash down. I don't think we stacked more than 5 or 6 pieces at a time before it would fall apart.

It works on concentration, because you have to gently hang pieces off other pieces without knocking the whole thing down. The rules are simple, too.

2424,5.0,GREAT Game for 1-4 people,"I purchased this game for our grandchildren for Christmas.  It is a game of strategy and balance.  The manufacturer recommends it for ages 8+ and we found that age level approrpiate.  The game is compactly packaged and easy to set up.  All you need is a flat surface.  Although there is a lot of luck in winning there is also skill learned in placing the metal, rubber tipped rods in a way that will not cause any other rods to fall.  The rods are of different lengths with different colors and learning that the longer the rod, the easier it is to balance is the first lesson!  Great fun for children and adults.<br /><br />The game pieces are typical of Melissa and Doug products.  They are well-made and sturdy.<br /><br />The game was shipped quickly and packaged perfectly.  I recommend this game and found the price on Amazon to be the best I could find at the time I made the purchase.",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AG5EOFQOTN3SGIIU43ENG4SFHHYQ,1390348288000,0,True

2430,5.0,"Slightly nerve-wracking, fun game!","I first played this game with my 5-year-old son. It says on the package 8+, but with adult supervision (and a little help), this game can be adjusted down to play with children.  He and I both had fun playing at the beginner level.  I called my 7 year-old-daughter and her friend to come see it when we were finished, and they were excited to play.  They are both smart girls, so I experimented and left them to their own devices with the game.  They quit after a few minutes.  So I would say that the recommended age of 8+ is pretty accurate - I'll try with my daughter again and I'm sure she'll love it.<br /><br />The game play quickly makes you as anxious as a game of Jenga or Kerplunk.  I thought it was neat to watch the way the whole structure changed with each piece, and rarely did the thing end up having pieces fall or touch the play surface during our game.  To me, it felt like a combination of interacting with moving art, combined with an experiment in balance.  I'm glad I got this game and would recommend it.",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AFEFIMBOMPLAQRNGE67LQBE6ADNA,1340910025000,0,False

I think she called it a &#34;wildcard gift&#34; - a risky pick that may or may not turn out to be fun. It turned out to be fun.<br /><br />I've played this with younger people, with older people, friends, and strangers. The rules are very adaptable so it's quite fun to come up with house rules to change the game over time. We've played &#34;infinite suspend&#34; where we tried to keep the structure going for as long as possible; we've played it as a drinking game (with hilarious results, as proper play takes a good bit of hand-eye coordination); and we've played it according to every rule set that it shipped with.<br /><br />I think the most striking aspect of Suspend, at least at first, was how beautiful the resulting structures can be.

Players on their  turn you will try to balance different lengths of metal on other metal which is all ready in play based on the color which they rolled on the dice. You will try to place your hooked metal pieces from your pile on the teetering metal madness which the other players have placed.  Whatever pieces you have fall over in your attempts become yours to evidently deal with. The first to get all of their pieces on the balancing metal structure wins.  This game is more exciting and strategic yet at the same time balanced than Jenga because even when you have one piece left you have to roll that color with your dice roll, if you don't have the color rolled then you have to take from another player's pile.

3049,5.0,The best game ever!,"This little game is a lot more than the size of the package.  It's kind of like Pick-up-Sticks hung on a hook, and like Tip-It! in the way the tangle of pieces re-balances for every play.  It has tension and drama like Jenga.  It will never play the same way twice, thanks to the myriad of ways to hang the pieces and tangle them together.<br /><br />I applaud the designers for their very simple yet very complex design.  The pieces are simple rods of metal with rather precise notch-shaped bends, reminiscent of small coat hangers.  A die roll and a color code determines the length, mass, and balance configuration of the next rod to be added to the tower.  While most pieces have a symmetric hanging point, and thus balance perfectly, the addition of a second piece must create an imbalance, and therein is the fun aspect in the game: the tower is constantly shifting and tilting.  What is more, the notches permit interlocking of pieces for the creative tower engineers, or hanging of the pieces in a precarious manner for the devious minds ready to sabotage the next player around the table.  The colored rubber tips add a bit of traction to multiply the number of possibilities.<br /><br />The rules are simple, making the game quick to set up and easy to explain.  An obvious ending happens when the tangled tower crashed from the hook.  The denouement can be slow-motion as single connections fail in sequence, which adds to the laughter.  Even without rules, it is fun simply building a hanging structure solo.  Young children can easily play this game.  We have some crazy gamers in our family, who extended the rules to tally points for the number of notches that fall in a given turn, and to sometimes require a player to remove a color-coded stick from the tower instead of add one to it.  Still further variations can be created by placing the base on a slope, using a shaky table, not using the dominant hand, securing the starting hook in an inverted position with a bit of tape, adding a rubber band to the hook, and so on.  We have not yet exhausted our ideas after almost 2 years playing this game.<br /><br />I am eager to see what is next!  Four-notch sticks that have no symmetry? Angled sticks? Springs??",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AGMIPFIJKCZFWTTRKBRWZJD5C5LQ,1389278227000,1,True

You roll the dice to determine which piece in your pile you must play and you have to hang it off of the pieces that are already in play. If you read the instructions and note which ways of hanging the piece are legal, there should be no problems with getting the whole structure to balance as you build it.

They have to look at the other pieces and predict what will happen when they place a rod in a certain place. They need to figure out where to put something even if there is no visible spot and sometimes you have to get creative as to where you put that big red one.<br />It has held up well so far. We have 4 little kids ranging in ages 3-8. Even our 3 year old (while needing to be on a team) has fun placing a piece and seeing what happens. Our 6 and 8 year old really get into it and often pick complicated placements.<br />While we love playing it with our kids, it’s also a lot of fun with adults. It doesn’t last too long, but it also isn’t too short. We can go through a few rounds before moving on to the next game and still want to come back to it. We play it with teenagers too and no one gets bored.<br />It is well made and has held up to our kids, however, you should still take care not to lose pieces especially the ones that secure and balance the base.<br />If you are looking for a new game, that isn’t a board game, this is a great choice for any family.",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AEWMS7POKJQQAVK4GADLSDDDZYCA,1460750222000,2,True

I saw this and ordered it immediately.<br /><br />My 2 year is very construction inclined and my 5 year old loves being good at any game or the best. They took to it immediately! Once the 2 year found out it could fall, he spent a couple rounds purposefully knocking it down but aftef that he did so well. The two of them will play it by themselves. They take turns and quietly play until it falls then there's tons of giggling and try agains. It is very easy to adapt the rules to fit your family. We try to make it a cooperative game and man oh man, I just can't get over how amazing this game is.<br /><br />Its very sturdy and fits into the container well.

3800,4.0,BEST GAME EVER!!! (More or less),"This game is AMAZING!  I learned of it last summer as I walked by a table it was being played on.  It immediately drew my attention, and I fell in love during my first game!  Since then, I've ordered over a dozen of them as gifts for friends and family.  I carry a set around whenever I'm going to a party or a bar, and it allways breaks the ice and draws in the curious!  I'd say about 95% of the people I've played with love this game.  It's easy to teach/learn, very durable/spilled-drink-resistant, fun for all ages, and caters to several different play-styles.<br /><br />Things Melissa & Doug need to improve:<br />  The case is flimsy plastic, and a few were broken during shipping.  Sometimes the bottoms come loose. How about sturdy paper-board?<br />  The wooden base could be a little larger to improve stability, and the holes could be tapered to keep the legs in place better. (Having the thing topple-over mid-game is fairly frustrating.)<br />  Many players (especially the colorblind) have trouble discerning the different colors on the die/rods, especially in low light. A solid dot instead of the current concentric circles on the die's faces might help.<br />  The rules don't explain how to determine who goes first.  Best I've figured is to arrange the rods by length, calling Black 1, and Orange 6, and then rolling the die to see who gets the highest.<br /><br /> All in all, it's now one of my favorite games!

This fit the bill on both accounts. While the rules are easy enough for children to understand their is a little bit of strategy and skill required for older players. I do wish their were more pieces. It's perfect for two players but if you have four then the games are really short. I might order a second set for an added challenge.

3862,5.0,Its addicting. Extremely addicting.,"[[VIDEOID:523fc92b5c67c0d62d3a1a7ad3eb6434]] Holy crap, never did I think this game would be so popular with my family. I got this game for my daughter and I, as we enjoy playing board games a lot. However most of my family loves video games, or simply enjoy watching.<br /><br />Picture it. I'm slightly hungover christmas eve, trying to get the yummy, greasy breakfast ready when I'm thinking about giving the kid something early to preoccupy her eager ""let's do something cool!"" Mode. I had just gotten this game a few days before, intending to give it to her since I still hadn't opened it from the amazon package. I give it to her to open, while I grab some eggs for breakfast. I check out the specs, a bit confusing at first but easy enough to understand in my Spinny haze. And as we began, I mildly read the rules and just set it to an easy play mode. Roll the dice and place your piece to balance. Cool. I get to figure out how to balance then do what I need to without having to think too hard.<br /><br />But oh boy....how did it lead to the only game any one else will play with us.<br /><br />At first my brother came in, thought it was neat, and played a few pieces with the kid as I got breakfast going. He usually would play a round or two for jenga, but that was it. Never really wanted to play anything else. Then my other brother came in. Staring hard at it and wondering what it was. I explained and he got all kinds of giddy. I let him know I'd bring it out to the ""hang out room"" later, when I was fully done with what I had planned.<br /><br />That's when hours of intense planning and semi hell broke loose.<br /><br />One by one, I had family coming in to say hi, and somehow gained a gathering of how to properly play, and how we can play for our own rules during Christmas.<br /><br />It. Lasted. HOURS. EVEN DAYS. 4 DAYS IN A ROW.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this game, not only for growing your cognitive reasoning skills, but also how to make your friends and family twitch with anxiety and anticipation.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916Rk8U1uCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916Rk8U1uCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916Rk8U1uCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AFVUNGVVQNQNMZXICLVA6FVTDPAQ,1610192963329,1,True

And after you have all of the pieces hung, it's just as much fun to see if you can remove them one at a time without disrupting the entire sculpture.  While it's recommended for 8 and up, a 3-year-old was able to hang pieces with a lot of help.  Nevertheless, its challenging - and whimsical enough - to keep teens and adults engaged as well.  Patience, concentration, a steady hand, and a little creativity are all key.<br /><br />One minor critique - the packaging isn't very strong, and this is such a weird shaped bundle of pieces, you definitely need some sort of container to store it in.<br /><br />Also, a wish - it would be great if they would come out with an extension pack with more odd shapes.",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AEMIFM5GYITCLFBKOQE7JZZY5QLA,1338310386000,259,False

Instead, it's in a flimsy clear-plastic cylinder, with the rules leaflet serving as the label.  This isn't sturdy enough for the metal pieces and wood base, and when I received it, it was already damaged.<br /><br />The game itself is fun, as long as you have space to set it up, and it's also fun to just make your own hanging sculptures.  It's like a return to the simple games of yore like ""Don't Break the Ice"" or ""Don't Spill the Beans.""  No reading is required; you can roll the color die, or just take turns placing pieces.<br /><br />This would be five stars with better packaging.

To her mom and me, that means she's learning basic physics while using proactive thinking skills (about consequences and ripple-effects) at the same time.  It's also great because even though the game comes with a ""rules"" sheet outlining several ways to play, you can easily make up your own rules and just have fun.  Another benefit is you can have as many players as you want!  Set up is simple, and it stores quickly and easily, too.  The ONLY complaint is that the plastic tube to store the game is relatively cheap plastic (ours arrived broken at one end).  If that's the only complaint, you can still count this toy to be five stars.  I'd highly recommend this for the versatile, tangible learning it provides.  And who says it has to be limited to kids?

4118,4.0,A Nice Addition to Game Night with Kids,"So our family has younger kids, and trying to find games that even the 3 year old can play came sometimes be challenging.  Our latest game is Jenga, which now that we have used Suspend has very similar qualities which is probably why they like this too.  This game comes in a (flimsy) plastic tube that can somewhat be resealed, if you open it carefully on top.  Definitely the container could have been made more durable.  Then the pieces are made of medal, wood and a bit of plastic.  The general goal of the game is to balance as many of the pieces as you can, but if any of them fall on your turn, you take the pieces.  The person with the least pieces at the end wins.<br /><br />I do like that they outline in the instructions the different ways of playing, from beginner to intermediate.  In a lot of ways, you could make up your own versions of that depending on the number of people playing and the skill level.  I also highly recommend that if you have kids older than 7 you allow them to play by themselves a few times as well.  Gives them some strategies they can use once they join a group.<br /><br />I think the price is right on this one, but again, I probably would have paid a bit more for a descent case for this.",[],B007EA4UBY,B007EA4UBY,AGIS3QL3LUEQWKF3YKHLLWDD5BJA,1341526809000,0,False
