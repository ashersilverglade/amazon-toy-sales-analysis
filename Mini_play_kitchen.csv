I thought the doors were stainless steel or plastic.  Not so - they are solid would painted a silver matalic.  If they have ""dents"" they have a very rough child who is chipping the wood.  The only plastic pieces are the door handles, knobs and burners.  I thought my now 4 year old, 40"" son would outgrow the cooking phase but, no such luck (we are short on space in our condo).

12,5.0,Love it.  Assembly instructions leave a lot to be desired,"I purchased the Uptown KidKraft Kitchen in the “natural” finish.  I want to start by saying this kitchen is awesome!  I got it for my daughter’s 3rd birthday present and she was ecstatic.  My 5 year old daughter also likes playing with it.  One of the reasons I picked this set was because of the height; it’s considered a “large” kitchen set and is taller than some of the comparable kitchen sets which was important to me because both my girls are on the tall side.  The details on the kitchen set are great, including the fact that the oven and stove top knobs turn and click, the water faucet handle moves, there’s actually a fridge and a freezer, the burners on the stove top are realistic, and there’s even a towel rack.  The product was well packaged and arrived promptly.  Even with the good packaging there were two damaged pieces.  Luckily it did not affect assembly (as I procrastinated and didn’t put it together until the night before her birthday) and KidKraft promptly sent me the replacement parts to change out the damaged pieces.<br />The main disadvantage to the kitchen set is the amount of time it takes to put together; it took me 3&1/2 hours to complete.  For the most part I assembled it by myself; I did need some help at the end to hold pieces in place as I put the top pieces on.  Part of the long assembly time has to do with the poor instructions; they are pictures only, no words.  And the pictures aren’t very detailed/accurate so sometimes you are not sure what end or side of the board you are working on or which step you should start with.  Also some of the screws/fasteners have colored tops (as they go on the outside of the kitchen set) and others are silver.  But they are marked with the same letter.  So unless you have a vision of what it’s going to look like it can be hard to determine if you should use the colored screws/fasteners or the silver screws/fasteners.  There was one place that didn’t quite line up correctly which is the top edge/side panel where the dishwasher is, it sticks out slighter farther than the counter top.  But it’s pretty minor and not enough of a blemish/issue to have me take away a star from my review.<br />I am so glad I purchased this kitchen.  It is sturdy and has great detail and both my kids have played with it every day since it was given.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGA32VQ34TFNVWHEJJ3S6OYIPEWA,1559861931456,0,False

I know what I got myself into when I ordered this and willing to build it on my own since I like to assemble things.. It calms me. Anyway took me 3 1/2 hours to build this beautiful kitchen. My only problem is the top cover for the microwave I'd damage. You can see it in the picture. Also the plastic parts are a little cheap so you cannot tighten it too much or else it will break. I learned my lesson coz I broke one for the dispenser which u will see on the pictures.. I am gonna call them today and see how are their customer service. I will update you if I get replacement parts since this just came today and it says on their warranty that they will send replacement parts within the 90 days of purchase..<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I finally got all the replacement parts for all the damage pieces.

41,5.0,Wonderful play kitchen!,"This is a gorgeous-looking, very realistic, very detailed and well-made kitchen! It's so cool that I want to play with it myself! Ours didn't have any broken or defective parts on arrival and was very easy to put together, with clear instructions, though it did take a while. I'm very handy and had a helper (my mom) and it still took me about 4 hours. So, be prepared to spend a good hunk of time putting it together. It arrives completely disassembled into a million pieces, but it comes together easily. For some parts it does require two people. I guess you could do it alone, but it would be very awkward and difficult. For some things, one person needs to hold the part level while the other puts the screws in, for example, and you just need more than two hands. So keep that in mind.<br /><br />I'm very impressed by the level of detail on this kitchen. Other similar kitchens have just a big sticker where the water/ice dispenser is on the fridge door, with the dispenser as a picture on the sticker, but this one has an actual nook with buttons above it (they don't press down, unfortunately, but it's still better than picture buttons!) The knobs on the stove make fun clicking sounds when you turn them. I see that they've updated the phone now - in older pictures it looks like an older kitchen phone, but now it has been updated to what looks like a white iPhone. I guess that's what the kids of today will associate with the word &#34;phone&#34;, so it makes sense.<br /><br />I absolutely love that the kitchen has a realistic, elegant look. It matches our real kitchen perfectly, because we have stainless steel appliances and dark wood cabinets, so it looks great in it. It looks like a part of the kitchen, not like the total eyesores that a lot of other play kitchens are - ugly and plastic and in horrible bright pink colors. This is something I wouldn't mind actually having in my home and looking at every day. It's beautiful!<br /><br />This is just a kitchen though, it doesn't come with any cookware or play food. I prefer that, so I don't have to pay additional money for gear I may not like. Everybody can buy their own accessories as they see fit. But if you don't have any yet, definitely do get accessories before presenting it to the child, so they can actually play with it. Not much you can do with just the kitchen. I got a set of pots and pans, a serving set (dishes, utensils and a tea pot), and a couple of sets of play food, including the kind that you can cut (that was a big hit, highly recommend!) and topped it off with a toy high chair for the dolls, and the whole thing was a huge success with my 2-year-old. We've had it for almost a month now and she plays with it every day, for most of the day! If you don't have anywhere nearby to sit a doll down, I do recommend a doll high chair, as well as some sort of little table to serve food on. I didn't want anything big or expensive, so I got a cheap little folding beach table that works perfectly for dolls. The kitchen, the accessories and the chair and table together make for endless hours of play!<br /><br />There are only a couple of things I wish were a little different, but they're all very minor. I wish the ice/water dispenser nook was a little deeper. Most toy cups don't fit and keep falling out (my daughter keeps putting them down inside the nook instead of holding them while the &#34;water&#34; pours in). There's plenty of room inside the refrigerator, so they could've made the space a little deeper... Same goes for the microwave - it's too shallow and plates don't fit in it, only small bowls and the saucers of the tea cups. There's plenty of room, they could've made it just an inch or two deeper. And lastly, the bar that holds the towel isn't attached to its holders, but just loosely slides inside the holes and rests in them. It's really easy to bump it and then it slides out and falls down. That's easily fixable though - I glued it in place with hot glue and now it stays put. That's all - nothing major, it's a great kitchen!<br /><br />UPDATE: We've had this kitchen for a year and a half now. We got it right around the time when our second child was born. He's 18 months old now and his sister is 3 and a half, and they both absolutely adore this kitchen!!! Don't look at the recommended age - any age child can play with it! Our baby loved opening and closing the doors as soon as he could crawl over to them, before he could even walk. Then he loved pulling up to stand on the kitchen, and standing and playing on it. Now he's old enough to actually pretend cook, and this is his favorite play area in the whole house! He loves putting cups in the microwave and saying &#34;milk beep beep!&#34;. It's absolutely adorable. So don't discount younger kids! I now feel bad for my daughter because I didn't think to get this for her sooner. She was a ripe old 2 when we bought it... She could've enjoyed it so much longer. Oh well. The two of them will be playing with this awesome kitchen for many years to come!",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFEIXWQVYO322QGI3W2CAAJUQSXA,1472516948000,12,True

On opening the carton, I was quite disappointed with the quality of the product.

We wanted to purchase a kitchen, but didn't want the old ugly plastic toy kind. This is a perfect fit.<br /><br />They spared no details. This is great, but expect to assemble for at least a good chunk of morning. If it's a gift make sure to plan when you might assemble it. You'd kids will not want to wait until this is built. It takes some real time.<br /><br />There are fun details I like that KidKraft didn't spare. The paper towel holder is awesome. We used a real roll and I expected my kids to unravel the whole thing, but they ended up liking taking their own towel to wipe their hands.<br /><br />It has hooks behind the oven to hang mitts and whatever else. We got pot holders and oven mitts at the dollar store. They work great.<br /><br />The chalk board works and cleans easily.<br /><br />It has a phone that looks like an iPhone, my kids love this. They pretend to call everyone they can think of. It has a nice little holder which has been great for keeping track of it.<br /><br />The trays in the oven and dishwasher are removable. My kids enjoy making play picnics on them or serving me food. I like its dual purpose.<br /><br />This will last long past your kids. So know it'll last and likely be able to be handed down or sold when they grow up.<br /><br />It does not include food or pans, so be sure to consider that when purchasing. You can find food and pans for cheap on Amazon as well.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHACJ5SH65X7XI3G2H2ZPCSDADIA,1453020858000,1,True
71,4.0,You can do it!,"Assembly is tedious and is a true act of love. I am a mom and put it together with a #2 phillips screwdriver and the two basic tools provided with the kitchen. The box was heavy but not so much that I couldn't lift it into the house. Assembly took several hours and was rather frustrating at times due to reading the diagrams and making sure I had the parts facing in the right directions but it was not that difficult. Nothing is pre-assembled meaning none of the door nobs or even simple latches etc come attached. I think this so that the pieces will be flatter and compact for shipping.<br />You should definitely take an inventory of all the parts by putting them in numerical order before beginning so that it is easier to grab a part when assembling, and also so that you know if anything is missing in the shipment. I was missing the 4 knobs that are for hanging any pots, pans and cooking utensils to the back wall. Luckily, this doesn't affect the assembly of the kitchen itself or I would have been very upset. I called Kidkraft and the message said all the operators were busy and to leave a message. There is no phone queue to wait for an agent. This was frustrating but I got a call back an hour or so later and the agent said the knobs would be shipped priority as I live in HI and regular mail would take too long which was nice.Also, there is no part 27. The agent said sometimes a number is skipped for some reason.<br />The latches for the microwave did not align perfectly as the pre-drilled holes were a bit off but I bent the latch a little to compensate. Also, the top piece of the top shelf was measured a bit off as it sticks out an extra half inch or so in the back than the rest of the kitchen but it's no biggie.<br />The kitchen is sturdy and seems to be of quality. My 22 mo old likes it and she is now washing dishes on the regular. (I bought her the green toys dish set). She also likes talking on the phone. She can't yet reach the top storage shelf but will grow into that very soon. The size of the kitchen is good- I don't have a big place but it fits nicely in it.<br />Room for improvement- I wish the fridge, dishwasher, and maybe the oven were a different color on the inside bc it is the same dark colored wood as the sides and non silver parts. This would make it more realistic as a real fridge is white on the inside for example. I also wish there was a bit more free counter space for her to ""cut"" fruit or what not.The little counter space is next to the sink and is not too big. Also, the burners are not fixed to the counter so my baby kept taking them out so I glued them in so they are no longer removable.<br />I tried to order this on Amazon but it was difficult to find a seller that would ship to HI at all. I finally found one with a shipping fee that wasnt the same or more than the kitchen itself but Amazon sent me an email a week after I placed the order to tell me that the seller couldn't ship to HI after all. I was very annoyed that it took so long after I ordered it for Amazon to cancel the order. However I found this kitchen for a much lower price at W****rt and although the shipping was higher the total came out to be about the same, and the kitchen also came with a 125 piece food set which I was able to return at my local Walmart store and get part of my money back.<br />All in all we are happy with the kitchen!

93,4.0,Tips for putting it together (it's worth it in the end).,"We just put this together last weekend and only gave it to our daughter for her 2 year birthday yesterday, so my feedback is based more on building it than on its longevity.  Yes, it took my husband and I about 3.5 hours to build it.  3.5 hours and we used an electric drill with an allen wrench drill bit.  So, if you don't have anything electric working for you, I can imagine it taking much longer.  There are a million pieces to this thing: it can be overwhelming.<br /><br />Tip 1: Don't start opening the hardware when you see it. Enter through the back as you go from step to step.<br />Tip 2: Some hardware has brown tips because the they will be up against the espresso wood.  Some are merely silver because they will never be seen.  The instructions do NOT specify when to use which. If this matters to you, you should be aware of it and take note of where the screws are going: if inside something like the refrigerator or stove, use the silver.  If outside, use the brown.<br />Tip 3: Again, I highly recommend an electric drill and an allen wrench drill bit.<br />Tip 4: Divide up the work over two days or so if you're working with a partner so you don't kill each other.<br />Tip 5: Work with a partner.  I can't imagine trying to do this alone.  There are some parts where you literally need one person to hold something while the other drills/screws, etc.<br />Tip 6: Do NOT be tempted to do steps before you reach them in the directions.  As flawed as I feel some of the directions are, doing the aforementioned will only add time to this already extensive project.<br />Tip 7: Read the directions beforehand.  Get an idea of where you're headed, what's going together first, etc.  It helped me visualize the process as we went along and therefore understand the directions better.<br /><br />The result? She loves it.  It's the longest stretch of independent play we've witnessed thus far.  It looks real---just like our kitchen.

Wouldn't buy again.","[[VIDEOID:857fd5bf81c37fc1e96ae05f020f8b5c]] The first problem I have is the poor quality of 5-10 of my pieces. Big abrasions on the finish, cracked wood.  2 screws that are stripped right from the factory.  1 nut that is flat out just not machined well so it ruined another screw leaving me with 3 messed up screws.<br />Wood with the holes not drilled out deep enough or with pieces of scrap still stuck in the hole.  I had to pocket knife some out to make pieces fit.<br />A few pieces are clearly scratched and damaged and it still was packed in the box.  The shipment didn't cause the damage, The box was perfect.  The abrasions and dents look bad but for a 2yr old to play with I wasn't about to pack up and ship back a huge box and cause myself a huge headache.  I don't want to lug that huge box back to FedEx to return so I suck it up and know better for next time.<br />The build time is 3-4 hours for the average person.  DO NOT use a drill, I have a drill on lowest settings and still had issues with it breaking the wood I'm careful about it and it still blew out holes that I ended up gluing together.<br />Keep that price in mind when you spend $129 bucks, You'll spend five times that in frustration and time to build it.  I've done entire homes of Ikea furniture, this is definitely a step down from ikea build quality and finish.  I'm not happy with it at all but  for my 2yr old, he'll be happy with it.  Ultimately it's a cheap thrill for the kid and I expect it to hold up a year or two and I'll junk it and he'll be on to the next thing.<br /><br />If you can afford the more expensive stuff, get it.

131,4.0,Pretty good for kids to have fun with.,"The kitchen has all the major appliances for imaginative play~fridge/freezer, microwave, oven, stove, sink, and dishwasher.  However, the wireless phone and holder is a bit dated, haha!  The pegs to hang mugs is a nice touch.  The paper towel holder to the right of the dishwasher is functional.  The espresso color is tasteful for the parents that don't want their kids' toy colors (i.e. loud child colors) to overwhelm their living space.  This would not be much an issue if it lives in a child's room but for us, this lives in our living room.<br /><br />When buying this, I suggest you get some other kitchen toys like pots/pans/utensils/play food items, etc.<br /><br />Assembly instructions are pretty clear.  Is it perfect? No, but good enough. Some plastic parts strip out easily; this happened to me when tightening a screw with my driver on the &#34;ice maker&#34; attached to the &#34;fridge door&#34;.  I fixed it by simply epoxying the ice maker to the door.  My advice would be to use manual screw driver to tighten screws to avoid stripping out plastic parts.  It took me a good 3 hours (including fixing broken parts) to put this together and I consider myself &#34;experienced/handy&#34;.  If you are not the handy type, plan on maybe 3.5-4 hrs.  And, it's heavy enough that it's a good idea to ask somebody for help if you need to move it.  It's not that heavy but it's bulky and becomes awkward to handle with just one person--no point in tweaking your back while doing this...<br /><br />I took a star off because the plastic parts can be made better, or at least the instructions should warn you against using a power driver to avoid stripping the parts.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFBZC5IYMB4R2YWC2EABH2W34HIA,1484680153000,1,True

143,4.0,Looks like a real kitchen from the outside,"Pros: Looks like a real kitchen from the outside. Sturdy and heavy (needs to be anchored to the wall for safety and should stay inside the house). Should hold up well for home use but plan on making repairs along the way, I would not put this in a daycare however.  Cons: Doors are not going to hold up, will need to install cabinet hinges because the pins don't line up on the fridge door. Took 3 hours to assemble, could have done it in 2.5, (don't pay attention to anybody that says it takes more than 4 hours because it does not). Inside of the fridge should be white.  Overall, there is just not a lot of quality kids kitchens out there at this price point so it is what it is, a pretty good little kitchen at a decent price, but not overly spectacular.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-+7mFaQ9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-+7mFaQ9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-+7mFaQ9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zSt5eWryL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zSt5eWryL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zSt5eWryL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFZFYCN4PMSFKP7VBRSAO3FJIWVQ,1466082716000,0,True

The box that it shipped in weighs about a hundred pounds.<br /><br />When installing just make sure that you have adequate amount of time. My dad, who is an engineer came and put it together for my daughter and did it in a little under 4 hours.  You need a good amount of patience and somebody that can follow directions quite well. My suggestion is to find a quiet area that you can lay out all the parts and make sure you have everything before you put it together.<br /><br />My daughter is 3, and my son is 6. They both love playing with this. It looks so nice. She actually has a nicer kitchen than I do!<br /><br />If you want a quality piece that is going to last your family for many years I suggest this kitchen.

158,5.0,Really glad this is the kitchen we chose.,"Wow! I'm sure a lot of reviews have been written about this product, but here's ourt two cents: It's really great, lots of &#34;functions&#34;— phone, stove, microwave, etc. The stove knobs have a great feel and make a wonderfully &#34;clicking&#34; sound as you turn them. It's also much more compact than you might imagine. We assumed we'd have to store it in the garage or something, but it's very compact and fits in the girl's room wonderfully. They LOVE it.<br /><br />The downside might be construction. Assembly took several hours and all the parts don't always match up perfectly. Also, if you tighten something down after say, step 22, by the time you reach step 45 you may find you piece doesn't fit right and you're going to have to lossen that stuff from back at step 22, insert your new piece and re-tighten. The pictures in the instructions can be vague as well. There's not any sort of &#34;make sure that panel faces this direction&#34;. You're going to need to figure that out for yourself. Moreover, the package of hardware is equally murky. There are for example, &#34;x&#34; amount of &#34;C&#34; screws, however, some have brown heads, some have silver. There's not a distinction like screw &#34;C-b&#34; to signify &#34;brown&#34;, they're all just labeled &#34;C&#34; and the instructions don't mention which you should use at any given point, so be sure you ration your screws appropriately otherwise at the end you'll be out of brown headed &#34;C&#34; screws and have too many silver headed &#34;C&#34; screws and if you want all the pieces to match, you'll need to go back and take something apart to get yourself another brown headed screw.<br /><br />So, great product that the kids love, but the instructions and labeling could use work. 5 stars for the product 3 stars for the instructions. Lastly, as long as there are two adults, it can easily be constructed in the garage and moved then moved to your room of choice.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AENOLM3XNYNU32T5ZNWGJAKVSAWA,1452796988000,2,True

My son is big for his age (40"" at 2.5) this kitchen is a nice size for him right now and something he can grow into for sure. It does not bother me that it has no accessories because I would rather buy my own. I am very picky about how realistic food looks and how to scale pots and pans are. Also I like that there are no sounds so my kids can create and imagine by themselves! (only sounds are the knobs turning)<br /><br />I put it together in about 2 hours with a one year old and a 2.5 year old ""helping"". However I am familiar with putting flat pack furniture together.

195,5.0,This play kitchen is beautiful!,"I just purchased and built this for my son. He loves it and his older brothers liked it as well. Now be prepared, you will open the huge heavy box and think &#34;What have I gotten my self into.&#34;, but the end result will be completely worth it. There are as mentioned in other reviews only picture instructions.  They aren't too difficult to follow once you get the hang of it. Simply make sure you have everything facing the way the directions show and you'll be fine. Eventually you get the hang of the instructions and figuring them out is easy. This is easiest to assemble as a two man team but I managed to build it alone while my husband was at work. I'd say without having to stop it would take between 2 to 3 hours. It took me longer because I had the kids bugging while I was trying to work on it.<br /> Tip: Do not use a power drill use a screw driver because the screws strip easily and do not over tightened. There are a million screws so even if one is a little loose the kitchen will still be super sturdy.<br />There are multiples of the same type of hardware but some of them have different finished heads. For example some have brown painted heads so the blend into the wood. So just keep an eye out on where the piece will go because the instructions don't specify this and they aren't even marked differently on the hardware box. So you'd use a brown finished screw and bolt if you are placing the piece inside the fridge or icebox and if the piece is going, say inside the oven or being screwed into the back, you'd just use an unfinished screw and bolt. You will use all the hardware except for the pack that says extra because well that's extra.<br />The only negative comment I have is that two or the stove top coils came with damaged prongs, one was broken completely and the other was almost broken off. Each one comes with 3 prongs to screw in so it wasn't a big deal I just put the damaged ones in the back.<br />I'm not going to lie, this was a pain in the rear to put together just because it's so much to assemble but like I said before it will be very worth it.

208,4.0,Build quality review,"I am not going to try to offer an opinion on how much kids will enjoy this thing because that is not my area of expertise. This review is about build quality and time to build. On those subjects I have much experience. The good:<br />• All the parts were there and the hardware is neatly packaged and decent quality<br />• Pieces are well made. They are very and flat square and free of rough edges.<br />• Plastic parts are of decent quality<br />• Finish is good.<br />The not so good:<br />• Parts are not packaged in the order they will be used leading to some searching.<br />• Instructions are all visual and good enough but could be clearer<br />• Packaging protects the parts but is really messy static charged Styrofoam.<br />• Build time is long. If you get this done in under five hours and get it right you are pretty good.<br />• You really should have a good electric screw driver or drill with a clutch to assemble this.<br />When my wife told me she bought this for our grandson I took a look at some reviews and the first thing that jumped out at me was the amount of time it took to build. I didn’t really feel too good about dumping a 5 or 6 hour job on my son in law so I put it together yesterday afternoon. Being retired makes so many things possible.<br />When you start make sure you have some space for this project. I used the space in our garage where I usually park my car. That is enough. We laid out all the panels based on their numbers in 4 stacks. 0 to to 10, 10 to 20, 20 to 30 etc. This will definitely save you some time. Keep all the plastic parts handy.<br />There are points in the process where it is a good idea to be using something like a work mate table for clamping or a second set of hands to hold stuff while screws, nuts, bolts and parts are assembled.  Follow all the instructions and eventually it all comes together.  Don’t try to pull this off on Christmas Eve after your kids have gone to bed. It would be a long night. All in all not a bad project but rather long. My wife thinks it’s great and will be a big hit so it’s all good",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHHHURGAMJ4IAOOMKFC2QAGOHZDA,1512587378898,2,False

213,2.0,Hard to assemble & not good quality!,"This kitchen looks as pictured. The parts, however had various scratches, dents, etc. even though I purchased it new. Some of them I didn't realize until I had already put the kitchen together and by then, I had gone too far. The assembly is doable in probably 5-6 hours with a drill and extreme attention to detail. The kitchen is sturdy if it's put together correctly, but parts of it aren't- like the hooks- one broke while I was putting it on the back of the board and there was no extra. Also, some of the screws were messed up upon arrival, but they do include a few extras, so that was good. If I had lost or broken any myself compounded with the fact that some were defective, I would have been out of luck. The lines on the oven door were crooked and things like that as well, so I was just really disappointed in the quality- especially for a product this expensive. Overall, I was not impressed with the quality, but at least it is as pictured. Another thing I'll mention is that it does not makes sounds or have lights or anything- so just keep that in mind.

238,5.0,Well made Kitchen with lots of Extra features,"We spent a lot of time looking at different wooden (not plastic) kitchens for our 3 year old son. We chose this one because it had all the features we wanted (the little extra details such as the chalk board, ice cube dispenser on the fridge, dishwasher, paper towel holder and oven and phone as well as the main kitchen features like the fridge, freezer, shelf above, sink and oven). It was in the medium size range, not too small and not one of the corner units that we just didn't have room for. We are so glad we got this one!<br />Let me start by saying, like most other people that reviewed this product, it does take a long time to put together. My husband used to put items like this together for JCPenney and it took him 3 hours over 2 days. There were a ton of different components and pieces. Once its put together, though, it looks fantastic and has lots of little details that make it look really cute.<br />We brought this out as his last present at his birthday party and all 6 same age kids descended on it with fervor. As most 3-5 year olds are, they are pretty rough and wanted to explore ever inch of it- and it held up like a champ. The doors open and closed smoothly and have a little latch on the inside and another neat feature is inside the oven and washing machine the shelves slide out and in.<br />It got to us really quickly but was pretty heavy so I had the UPS guy wheel it into the house...lol.<br />I recommend this kitchen to any budding chef or child who likes &#34;helping.&#34; Its a great product and we are so glad we got it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DQ3nDGGjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DQ3nDGGjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DQ3nDGGjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q4D3xAmeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q4D3xAmeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q4D3xAmeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j8MNO8C9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j8MNO8C9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j8MNO8C9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AG4HINTXX2Y2XDCUA7IQCXBJAV2A,1426429292000,9,True

I wish I had spent just a little more for the extra bells and whistles such as sounds and lights for more stimulation but took the advice from previous and added stick on lights in the microwave, refrigerator and the oven as well as above the stove top. Much more realistic. Assembly was extremely time consuming. I have put together countless pieces of furniture and toys and this toy took longer than my 6 yr olds bunk bed with trundle. Approximately 4-5 hrs by myself. The pieces are labeled well and instructions are step by step but I did have some trouble with a couple pieces of hardware being stripped out before use. Not a huge problem but adds to the time. Overall I think this is a nice toy. It came with 30 pieces of food and i got a free set of pots and pans that sweetened the deal. I'm sure it'll get alot of use.

The refrigerator holds a lot of food, and she loves all the additional features: microwave, small spice shelf, hanger for a towel, sink. We haven't had any problems with things breaking or being damaged (though she rarely plays rough).

284,5.0,Love it!,"Glad that we selected this kitchen!  I was hesitant at first because of the reviews in which people said that assembly was a nightmare and nothing worked...  This wasn't our experience AT ALL.<br /><br />After our son went to bed, hubby hauled the box (heavy, but not 100 lbs as stated in a negative review) to an open area with good lighting so that we could account for and organize everything for assembly.<br /><br />It's a good idea to review the instructions completely and catalogue each piece before beginning assembly.  I'd also recommend not waiting until the day before to begin assembly.  We ordered and received this kitchen in advance and put it together to allow time for any possible corrections.<br /><br />Yes, there are a lot of screws and boards, but that's to be expected -- otherwise, you'd 1) complain that it needs additional support/screws... or 2) complain that the box is too big if it were partially assembled.<br />If the screws didn't align for us, it was because we had the piece turned the wrong way (gotta pay attention to the pictures in the instructions).<br />End result: everything aligned just fine.<br />And, yes, some of the screws have different finishes.  The instructions didn't point that out, but...the brown-head screws go on the brown board/pieces; the white screw-heads goes on the white board; and the silver-head screws go on the undersides/parts not visible.<br /><br />It took us several hours (we took our time, chatted, snacked, ...), but our patience and hard work paid off.<br /><br />It looks great and seems extremely durable.  I'm excited -- can't wait for our son to see and play with it!<br /><br />Some may prefer a more &#34;childlike&#34; kitchen, but this is one that I hope will grow with our son.  The &#34;stainless&#34; finish is nice, and the espresso finish matches the KidKraft table and chairs that we purchased.<br /><br />I thought that I read that this comes with a baking pan, but it doesn't.  No big deal; I'll just grab one separately.<br /><br />At this point, I have no complaints and would definitely recommend this kitchen.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGTJD7MQGPBRLMP4T46XVVQYAVVQ,1447945593000,4,True

The MDF is veneered to look like real wood and the counter top is painted with silver splashes to look like granite or quartz. However nice this kitchen is it gets tainted by the awful task of putting it together. It isn't trying to find the nuts, bolts, and screws (they are all packaged nicely and labeled with a cardboard back that can be opened by compartment). It isn't figuring out which piece is which (all the pieces are labeled with numbers on stickers). It isn't even the picture instructions (if you're like me and have put together more ikea furniture than you care to say then you're fluent in picture). It's just that there is so many pieces and so much detail that makes it difficult. I had to put it together myself because my husband decided to go hunting and I had to take a lot of breaks because my back would seize up but I think it took 3 hours of work to put together by myself. Overall it's a nice product but it got 4 stars because you basically have to be a structural engineer to put it together.<br /><br />UPDATE: It is now 2018 and has been almost 4 years since I have purchased and put this item together. I am updating it to 5 stars cause even though t was a pain to put it together it is still standing!

360,4.0,"Really cute, assembly instructions could use some work.","Fully assembled, this is actually really cute, and my son loves it. I thought the price was pretty reasonable considering its size, and the fact that it seems like it will be fairly durable. The box is 70 lbs., and the packing looked a little rough when it arrived, but the foam inside the box seems to have absorbed any damage, as no parts were noticeably damaged.<br /><br />That said, the assembly instructions that came with mine were pretty wonky. The parts are numbered, but the part numbers don't have any relationship to the order they're used in the assembly instructions. The first step involves attaching part 40 to part 6. The set comes with some screws which are identical but for the color, but the instructions don't specify where to use espresso screws vs. silver screws. When you're initially assembling the kitchen, it isn't always apparent which side of a panel will be the inside or outside, so you'll likely use some espresso screws in the wrong places, and end up with silver screws where espresso screws should have been used. They also use letters to label the fasteners, but the fasteners aren't laid our on the panel in alphabetical order, so if you're looking for &#34;screw D&#34; it might be in the middle of the panel. Those are minor issues, but fixing those issues wouldn't take much effort on KidKraft's part either.<br /><br />The plastic ice dispenser cracked as I screwed in two of the screws (the plastic part that you screw into broke off). The two remaining screws seem to hold it together well enough, so I just used a bit of glue to provide some additional support. This solution seems solid enough.<br /><br />It took me 2-2.5 hours to assemble. A small electric screwdriver will save you a ton of time assembling this, but you'll need to take care to avoid over-tightening the screws.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGWL3M6ARQP22CTN6KV2JA67QURA,1473881298000,3,True

363,4.0,Faucet may get ripped off - but otherwise this is a huge huge hit.,"My son loves this set. The only down-side is that he and his cousin (both under the age of 2, actually it was my son's first birthday) took like 10 minutes to rip off the faucet. We thought about reattaching it but decided to just leave it off since it would likely get pulled off again.<br /><br />As for assembly, my husband and I were shocked by the number of pieces and hardware. I think there were over 150 bolts, washers, etc. so this is how we spent our Christmas: building this set.<br /><br />Still, we wanted a masculine looking kitchen set with modern elements to match out own kitchen and this one takes the cake. I looked at a lot of kitchen sets before deciding on this one. I love that it's gender neutral because for play dates neither the boys or girls can claim it's too boy or girl like. Also, when we go to resell the kitchen, I bet people will really like it.<br /><br />We set up the kitchen in our kitchen and my son often &#34;cooks&#34; while I cook. He makes running water noises, he talks on the phone, he puts things in the microwave, he pulls things out of the refrig. Also, if you are like us and lacking space after your kid is born, this is the set for you. We store our cereals on the top of the kitchen and our son can't reach them. Plus we store cans of corn and such in the refrig since our son loves to play with cans, and it offers a lot of extra storage.<br /><br />Our cleaners also store our son's toys in this unit. It can fit a lot, lot lot in the set.  Speaking of which, be sure to measure before you buy this set. It fits perfect for us (depth is quite narrow!), but we did measure before hand because the width is huge. In a good way.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFI6FXHNGVTXRGJDQCMTVQMXKC6Q,1438344003000,0,True

The details are exceptional and my daughter loves that it looks &#34;just like mommy's.&#34;  The multiple cupboards allow for a lot of imaginary play and provide many storage options.  We bought this for our daughter's first birthday and she was able to reach the bottom 3 no problem which was plenty sufficient.  With time she became tall enough to reach the freezer and microwave as well.  At the age of 3 she doesn't seem too big for it and actually has room to grow, unlike many other play kitchens.  Additionally, after 2 solid years with almost daily use it still looks almost brand new and we haven't had any issues.  It has withstood tugging and pulling and climbing.<br /><br />The only negative is it is a beast to put together.  There are lots of pieces and lots of directions that need to be followed in specific order.  So give yourself plenty of time and pour yourself a drink before starting.  But in the end it's totally worth it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HuqWdP+WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HuqWdP+WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51HuqWdP+WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c2KsdvUUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c2KsdvUUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c2KsdvUUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mjcGMTJFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mjcGMTJFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mjcGMTJFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mt3mlYuLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mt3mlYuLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mt3mlYuLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AEZR6T64FB5K754MBTJWEOIS6RRQ,1446867627000,11,True

The oven opens like a door with side swinging hinges so no worries on the former models others have commented on with little ones standing and breaking it. The corners can seem sharp, as common sense should tell you with wooden furniture. So, if your considering this for a child who isn't quite stable consider this on if they fall or try to climb on it, but other wise much much better than any of the more expensive plastic ones out there.

378,1.0,"""KidKraft Prank Your Assembler"" toy is what I call it.","If you want to keep your marriage/bf/etc, buy something else. It is however an excellent gag gift for with your husband<br />Sadly my wife's 5 star item turns into my 1 star nightmare.<br />All these 4 to 5 star ratings must have been people who didn't have to go through assembly.<br /><br />You should plan on 30-45 mins of cataloging the items in your garage/outdoors(they are all rectangles) and another 2 hrs and 40 mins of straight assembly!!!!<br /><br />Comes in an Ikea style flat shipping box, contains 45 Pieces and 21 nuts and bolts. Don't worry it gets worse. Screw type C and bolt type A had multiple finishes. How about labeling them C1/C2/C3 and A1/A2 instead of just C and A. I had to go to page 12 (of 14) the instruction booklet to figure out if I should use the brown,metal, or the white finish for step 2 and 3..... Furthermore, due to the weight of the package fully expect the foam to be shredded upon delivery. SO OPEN IN YOUR GARAGE/OUTSIDE. If you open the package in your house, you better expect a full styrofoam snow shower in your house.<br /><br />As for the &#34;sturdy structure that was designed by passionate engineers&#34; comment.... They must be &#34;engineers&#34;, without kids, and never once tried to assemble their own product. The sturdy design is obviously geared toward light adult use. There is no way a good Engineer would have put screws into the side of MDF(maybe paper) pieces without metal supports and expect it to last, specially on door clips. That is just asking for it to break when used by 3 y/o. The instructions followed the 80/20 rule(80% done using only 20% of effort).... Not very well thought out... It is obvious that this product was never assembled by KIDKRAFT's engineers or they would have updated the instructions in frustrations. Finally they must have had no kid because there is no way adults with a young kid has 3+ hours to spare for the assembly of a toy.<br /><br />Like I said if you want to have huge fight/gag gift/start a divorce, this is the toy to get. Nothing is more aggravating than a toy with bad instructions.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51E+turE2yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51E+turE2yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51E+turE2yL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kE8QL8z8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kE8QL8z8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kE8QL8z8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nWov9cHnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nWov9cHnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nWov9cHnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFS7HQMC5DQPHT5KVWEOE3EYGE5Q,1442851344000,73,False

383,5.0,Wonderful kitchen set! - UPDATED 04/08/2014,"I LOVE this kitchen set.  It goes well with our decor and it's really nice looking.  The only down side to this set is that it's a pain in the butt to put together.  It really took a few hours to put this together and came with SO MANY SCREWS!  But I still think it was worth all the time and effort to put it together.  My toddler loves this toy and I can see this getting many many hours of use over the years to come.<br /><br />** UPDATE AS OF 11/20/2013 **  There is a ""ice maker"" that is part of the fridge that CONSTANTLY comes loose.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to secure it to the fridge door.  It's a plastic part that has 4 dowels in the back that pops into 4 holes on the fridge.  There are no screws, no nothing to secure it other than the dowels in the holes.  My 17 month old bangs the fridge door and inevitably, the ice maker part falls out.  It's not a terrible issue and I still love the kitchen (as does my toddler) so I'm not about to knock off stars for it since crazy glue should be able to resolve the issue ... but it's worth mentioning.<br /><br />** UPDATE AS OF 4/8/2014 ** This kitchen is taller and bigger than the ""vintage style"" kidkraft kitchen.  I mention this because my kid is tall, but she has to tippy toe to open the microwave door on the top.  At her friends house, she can open the microwave quite easily.  So if you have a particularly tall child, or would like longer use out of your toy kitchen, this is the one to purchase since it's TALLER AND BIGGER than the other ones by KidKraft.

It's very sturdy & easy to assemble but VERY time consuming. The piece that clicked the washer shut had broken during assembly but it still closes so it's really not an issue for us. The only two things I don't like are: 1) The sink just sits in there. We'll probably end up glueing it ourselves. 2) The towel rod also just sits there so the kids can take it out easily. It makes me a little uneasy that the kids (especially my youngest) could grab it & run around with a rod but we'll manage.

Just don't put it off until Christmas Eve, or just before a Birthday Party, and think you can assemble this tedious thing by yourself in a few minutes.

434,5.0,Must buy for your toddler!,"I have been looking for a play kitchen for my 2 year old son. He loves helping with dishes, playing in the sink, and putting groceries away. After reading numerous reviews I finally decided on this particular one. I wanted one that didn't look cheap or plastic. I wanted it to be sturdy and go well with his ever-changing room themes and decor. I was super anxious for it to arrive and to put it together. I read some reviews about damaged parts and it taking forever to put together so I didnt want to waste any time once it got here.<br /><br />The first package I got there was a deep gash in the little ice machine part. I emailed them and they sent a replacement. Customer service was excellent and they were very prompt. ***they cannot ship you just one replacement part, they have to ship you the entire kitchen set over again  and you're responsible for sending back one set or you WILL be charged for two ****<br /><br />Other then that all the other parts had no big issues. Some minor scratches that's all. Everything was labeled with stickers which made it super simple. It took my husband and I about 1 and a half hours  to assemble this. Not as bad as I was expecting so that was a huge plus. Once it got put together it looked really nice and was super stable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-modern look<br />-sturdy<br />-durable<br />-burners click when you turn them<br />-lots of room inside<br /><br />Cons:<br />-number buttons are just painted on, they don't make noise<br />-plastic in the stove door looks flimsy but we will see how long it lasts<br />-would be cool if it had a light built in above sink<br /><br />So I really don't have anything bad to say about it. I will purchase more kid kraft products in the future. I have already bought the laundry set to go with this and they look great together.

435,4.0,"Beautiful Kitchen, Difficult Assembly","Bought this for my son who is 1&1/2. When we finally got it all together, it kept him busy for hours!! It's a beautiful wood kitchen, very heavy and sturdy. Everything arrived in perfect condition. I'd say the biggest downfall was the assembly of this thing. It took quite a bit of time. (Even with 3 adults trying to put it together). The directions are just pictures and the hardest part is that some of the same screws are silver while others are brown and it doesn't tell you which one to use, so you have to figure out if the piece you're working on will be going on the inside (silver screws) or outside (brown screws) of the kitchen. You also have to figure out the fronts and backs of all the pieces because it doesn't clarify that in the directions either. And the only thing I didn't really like about the kitchen itself was the shelving on the inside of the oven and dishwasher, I wish it wasn't so easily removable because my son continues to take them out. But besides all that, once we got it together, it was definitely worth it in the end. And I'm hoping this lasts for many years.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71frDbyEN9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71frDbyEN9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71frDbyEN9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHNHPHEADEG6JOWSHQIC7P6QGYQQ,1542978870744,4,True

But the kitchen itself is pretty cool. And seems pretty sturdy. Our 3yr old loves it. He's been cooking things like crazy and telling us to be careful it's hot and to wash our hands.

439,5.0,ADORABLE!!!!! NICER THAN MY KITCHEN! :),"I can't begin to explain how cute this little kitchen is! We bought this for our 2 year old, and we are so happy with the purchase! I read that it took hours and hours to build, however it only took my husband start to finish about 2-3, so def. give yourself some time and be sure to put the pieces in piles together for easier assembly. After building it, we noticed a few tiny details had not been fully painted on (see picture) but these were minor, and something my toddler probably won't even notice. Also, we got the cell phone/iphone &#34;look alike&#34; phone as opposed to the big wall phone others have mentioned they received. Wish the phone had a cord to it so that it doesn't get brought from room to room- but my son loves talking on it!<br />The piece is solid, and just so adorable. I've attached pictures to show kitchen fully built. We got IKEA pots and pans that fit perfectly; M&D felt sandwich making set, M&D wooden fridge and M&D pantry set, M&D Food cutting set, M&d Grocery can set, M&D playtime veggie set, M&D  Christmas cookie set, Le Toy Van Wooden Pops, Learning Resources Dish Set, and PBS Sandwich stacker. All of those items fit into the kitchen no problem. Also, I have kept old M&D wooden holders from other toys and have used them to hold items in the kitchen to keep it a bit more organized. We ended up getting the M&D coffee maker, as well as the Kidkraft Espresso Toaster later as a gift (Both items not pictured) and both of the items fit great on the small counter, and the shelf above the sink. I also got a little tin bucket from the Target $1 section to hang on the knobs for holding all the big spoons and spatulas. Wishing the spoons could have hung there, but the knobs are so big! So happy with purchase, our child loves it- especially the microwave, and we are having a blast cooking :) Highly recommend this kitchen!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717JtNtjZtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717JtNtjZtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717JtNtjZtL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DB8UnTcjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DB8UnTcjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DB8UnTcjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TNRqpvVHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TNRqpvVHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TNRqpvVHL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YQBrZI26L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YQBrZI26L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71YQBrZI26L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lxHPIBwkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lxHPIBwkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lxHPIBwkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yL+4b-odL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yL+4b-odL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yL+4b-odL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGLMEVLMCCE6URIW5FEI5N7TOJPQ,1452701944000,39,True

464,5.0,Great Kitchen that looks amazing in person!,"I purchased this for a gift for my daughter who will be turning 5.  The height is great, I would say  the age range would be from 3 years to older, but it's not too bulky or large to fit nicely in a playroom, kitchen etc . . . you have to admit, it looks beautiful! First, I will start with the packaging, the box is very heavy and I noticed the reviews on this product show the process of putting this kitchen together is time consuming.  It took me around 3 hours, I chose to do this over a period of 2 days so it really didn't seem that bad - if you plan on it, it will be less stressful.  The instructions are very well put together, besides having a picture diagram for each piece there is also a screw/tool set that is numbered accordingly (pictured below) it looks overwhelming at first but trust me, it is very easy.  Now, the only thing I would say you need to know that is not written in the instructions is the &#34;A&#34; pieces and the &#34;C&#34; Screws have two different options.  One is the Brown Colored heads which will go on the pieces that will be visible and the Silver Colored heads will be the ones that go on the inside pieces.  Also, the middle wood panel has the sliding pieces that will go on both sides.  In the instructions it looks like it will only go on one side, but it should be on both as this will hold the &#34;Cutting Board&#34; and &#34;Shelf&#34; (under the Sink/Stove.)  Once you put this together, you will notice the nice details and finish. The board pieces are painted wood, so it does not have the cheap paneling that may wear off in time, for this reason I am confident this should stay looking great for a long time.  This does not come with accessories but it does come with the phone, chalkboard, cutting board, shelving and the knobs to hang cookware.  I am very excited for my daughter to use and I love that it looks great and is not tacky or bulky to have anywhere in the house!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BJW4x5rEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BJW4x5rEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31BJW4x5rEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AE3NXVRT27U42E2IY4FXCM2TCW6A,1467640827000,0,False
465,5.0,Very nicely built and perfect for your budding chef.,"This is a really cool design.  It's a bear to assemble, though, as it took me 3 hours and i actually build furniture, cabinetry and all things wood and metal.  There are a LOT of pieces and this sucker is heavy.  Shipping weight is 78 lbs and the packaging is less than exciting.<br />Our first delivery of this item arrived in pieces.  It seems the Dallas UPS center employs an 800 lb gorilla with a PCP habit and bad attitude to handle their large packages.  I've had more deliveries destroyed here with UPS than ever in my history - and I ran a shipping and receiving dept. for 3 years.  The Dallas office of UPS can destroy ANYTHING - so this item was a piece of cake for them.<br />When I received the totally destroyed product, I contacted the seller and they were most apologetic, offering to FedEx a replacement.  Unfortunately, this product is too heavy for FedEx, so the replacement arrived via UPS and - miraculously - arrived in one piece!<br />Assembly:<br />Give yourself some space to work on (carpeted so you don't scratch the pieces while assembling them) and allocate several hours to the task.<br />There are different colors of 2 different screws.<br /><br />The &#34;C&#34; screws come in shiny metal, wood colored - and there is one white one.  The directions do not make a distinction between these.<br />The screws with the wood colored heads go against the wood colored surfaces (most of the exterior.<br />The silver screws go against metal or the interior when they will not be seen.<br />The one white capped &#34;C&#34; screw goes on the &#34;telephone&#34; panel on the right side of the panel to the left of the microwave.<br /><br />The A / E combination screw / embedded nut assemblies come in 2 colors as well - and there is one shiny metal set of a different letter that is just a little longer.  These go into the vertical metal pipe that hold the right end of the shelf / microwave assembly.<br />Again, the wood colored screw heads go against the wood finish and the silver ones go where you won't see them (on the back and inside)<br /><br />You don't need any additional tools other than a phillips head screwdriver to assemble this unit.  Just take your time and I found a rolling short shop stool to be the most comfortable way to do the assembly.

473,3.0,Would be awesome if it didn't arrive damaged!,"This is a really nice quality kitchen.  It took about 1.5 hours to assemble.  However, when we received it, it was damaged.  When you pay this money for an item, and it arrives damaged, it's frustrating.  It's a christmas gift to my child from Santa, and so we don't have enough time to return it (nor would it be easy to, since it's a large package).  The corner was so cracked, it won't hold a screw. Luckily it's at the top, so didn't affect putting together the rest of it.  There were other small damages as well, scratches and blemishes as well as another minor crack.  I don't know if the issue is the amount of protection or with the transportation company, but either way, a bit disappointing.

480,3.0,Pretty nice product,"This thing looks great. Pretty good detail. Took me about 2 hours to assemble. Im a 23 year old father who is great with his hands and very fast on average. My son is going to absolutely love this. It's a tad bigger than expected which is great. Product arrive with pretty extensive damage to the box. However, I work in a warehouse and am aware of how often things like this occur and actually don't damage the item inside the box. Plus this thing came with great inner styrofoam packaging. I assume the damage to the box had something to do with the time of the year the item was shipped as UPS and FedEx are extremely busy right now due to Christmas. It was a little more difficult to put together than I would have liked and expected for something of this nature. The instruction manual pictures are rather small. I struggled to see several parts of the assembly process and couldn't imagine how someone slightly older with lower performing eyesight would see these. I took a vision test last year and have perfect vision.  Part numbers Q and R I believe could use a different design. I did away with them all together. I got frustrated with them because logically they made no sense to me. I've used so many different types of hardware and I have never seen anything like this. I am a somewhat experienced wood worker so I took a taper bit to hide the screw heads and boared out some holes close to where the Q and R support peices were suppose to go and just zipped in some small 1&#34; screws to hold the middle and right side of the counter top down. Had I not ran in to this issue with the design of these hardware pieces and the length of time it took me to put this together I would have given this 5 stars. Annoying to put together, but after this thing is put together it is worth it.

493,2.0,Not the same as advertised image. Quality issues.,"Yes, it’s cute. However, the manufacturer has obviously cut some corners at the expense of the consumer. My biggest issue is that the utensil hangers that were supposed to be part of the backsplash behind the oven/sink were missing. This was clearly intentional since the portion of the backsplash meant to attach them to was also missing (so backsplash overall was downsized considerably versus advertised image). Also, the chalk board in the picture has a nice stainless colored raised frame around it, but what I received was just a “framed” chalkboard sticker. It’s really cheap looking.<br /><br />This kitchen was expensive, and I expected to receive exactly what was in the advertised image. The backsplash/utensil hanger absence bugged me most, as it really takes away from the overall look of the kitchen.<br /><br />Final issue- even after several attempted adjustments, the door of the oven and under-sink cabinet do not hang right, and therefore, do not shut nicely. Better quality would have been nice....<br /><br />Would not purchase again, especially at this price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e6hfVjEQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e6hfVjEQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81e6hfVjEQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHV6XMEF2DXRQ7QGUGILDHYJZVMA,1607744744685,1,True

This is a job for 2 people, not one. So plan on that. The directions don't tell you what to do first, it goes by vague pictures. But, too many times, I had to go back and redo or take apart. There is a huge pack of hardware that comes with extra hardware. Be prepared to use the extra hardware, as a lot of the bolts and screws strip easily. Have an extra L wrench on hand as well, the one they give you strips out. Also, plan on a few different sizes of screw heads. What really makes you mad, is that the bolts and screws are all different colors and don't match, so you have non matching pieces all over. And there isn't enough of the pretty ones to use on the outside, so you have to use the other ones. Nothing in this set is pre assembled,you literally put every piece on. If I would have had an extra hand, it would've been much easier. But since I didn't, it took me about 8 hrs of assembly while caring for the kids and what not.

(She later asked me to take her home because, ""My kitchen is waiting!) I like that this is realistic and even looks good in my son's living room. I'm not a fan of gaudy, bright colored plastic toys for role playing. Assembly was a challenge, but instructions had mostly clear, large pictures (no words). I am a long time DIY grandma who has helped build houses and repaired many things. It took me 5 hours total to assemble. I spent 2 hours assembling all of the handles, accessories, stove top, and shelf hardware. A lot of that time involved finding the correct parts and getting then out of the packaging. ***Alert- pay attention to the screws and bolts, as directions do not mention that some are brown to match the wood when visible, and others are chrome (they're all given the same letter/number key). Some of my time was wasted switching these around once I realized it. The main construction took three hours, and I had estimated one! Some of that was the hardware switching, but much was the counter top attachment- it would have been easier to attach all of the parts, such as the faucet, before attaching to the unit. The area around the sink had stubborn hardware that didn't want to stay tight, and I feel this is its most vulnerable spot for coming apart, especially since it is likely to be picked up at that edge.  I must have removed it and started over at least four times. The microwave shelf post on mine is not quite right in height, and the top shelf is not straight because of it- tried to sand down one end (hard plastic) which improved it a little. I may eventually try to fix it again. Another useful tip from the You Tube video is to use dish soap on the screws. This was very helpful when screwing into plastic parts.

553,4.0,Assembly is difficult but ultimately worth it,"I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and it looks just as nice in person as it does on-line.  What I wasn't 100% prepared for was how difficult it would be to put together.  Assembly took almost 6 hours so be prepared (unless you are a professional carpenter) you will likely need another person to help assemble, a lot of patience and an entire afternoon.  There are no written directions and no on-line videos (I've noticed a lot of toy manufacturers have started doing this and it is very helpful).  The pictures they provide in the instructions are not clear. I was also really disappointed that ours was missing some of the screws and some of the other parts were either not long enough or didn't fit properly.  A trip to the hardware store fixed that and was easier to spend a couple of bucks and get it done than calling the manufacturer and waiting on them to send replacement parts.  There were also some scratches and nics in the wood.  Nothing major enough that I would return it, most were not visable unless you are up close and after some serious play from a toddler similar imperfections are bound to pop up, so ultimately I would recommend this play kitchen and your kids will love it.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AEJDGJ4OEJB7MRS5V5XEYSZVZPYQ,1370910514000,0,True

608,4.0,POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES!,"I purchased this for my 18 month old grandaughter. I have some very Positives and some &#34;sort of&#34; Negatives.<br /><br />Positive: This set has proven to be a true hit with her and I feel that she will be able to grow with it - the size is perfect, it looks incredible. She LOVES all of the nooks and crannies as well as the turning knobs and sink features. She loves to do the &#34;ring ring&#34; and answer the phone. She is still a little too small to reach the upper shelves but I feel that in a matter of months that will no longer be an issue.<br /><br />Negative: When this was first shipped the packaging was DESTROYED. When we contacted Amazon we were referred to the dealer. While they did eventually ship us new parts, they wanted us to inventory everything and give them an itemized list of things that were damaged. Sounds easy, but there are hundreds of parts. We ended up listing something like 60 pieces that were damaged beyond using. They then shipped us a box with those pieces in it - two days later they shipped us another box with those 60 pieces in it. On Christmas Eve while trying to assemble it, we literally had multiple pieces of everything and the whole sorting process became very confusing. Once figured out though we are VERY happy with the set.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHMB7265WWBHDPZ3LKBHCXNLQCPA,1371729517000,1,True

614,5.0,"A bit of a project, but completely worthwhile when done!","Smart stuff:<br />1. the &#34;oven&#34; and &#34;dishwasher&#34; open horizontally like cupboards - while this is less accurate, it solves the problem of kids standing on the doors that in other sets open downward, and instantly are broken.<br />2. The set feels really solid, it's probably nicer than my actual kitchen cupboards and feels like it will last for a long time. I figured that &#34;backsplash&#34; was cardboard like so many flimsy bookshelves I've put together, but nope, it's actually wood - way better.<br />3. The colors are neutral - this is good both for multi-gender families as well as more aesthetically pleasing when plopped in amongst my other furniture. It's not the giant plastic eyesore so many other sets are.<br /><br />Not loving:<br />1. the door latches are a bit hard to maneuver for my 2 year old, despite her being VERY rough and physical, they are pretty stiff. Might loosen up over time, but some frustration when she can't open all the doors<br />2. Removable shelves in the two lower cabinets, not sure why but those shelves are the first thing she takes out. Wish they were just stationary, but this is a small gripe.<br />3. Putting it together took about 3 hours - it was definitely do-able, no individual task was that hard, I was able to do it myself with just the included materials + a power screwdriver, but I wasn't quite expecting that many steps. Was absolutely worth it though.<br /><br />Overall:<br />We've had this put together for a few weeks now, and I love it. My just turned 2 year old is pretty tall for her age, but I can see this set lasting for years, and it works great for her now as well. It is streamlined enough to not be obnoxious, but still has all the bells and whistles (without anything that makes bell or whistle noises, YAY! The oven dials do click when turned, but there aren't any other sound effects, even the phone is just a block of wood. I find that refreshing after so many noisy flashing toys). The sink is her favorite part, and she yanks on the &#34;spout&#34; frequently but it is well made and surviving.<br />I like how sturdy it is - unlike the plastic, I'm not worried she will tip it over, fall through it, or rip out the screws. This piece is basically furniture. It has a LOT of storage, so clean up is easy - all the play food and dishes can be stored inside the refridgerator and dishwasher without being seen. I also like that it is fairly neutral - both gender neutral and just design neutral. It is a large toy, but doesn't overwhelm my space with loud colors or garish finishes. It actually &#34;matches&#34; the armoire next to it quite well :)<br /><br />Highly recommended",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AE66BJMZOMXU57XBSUCLQILEYE2A,1357494050000,0,True

616,2.0,Terrible To Assemble & Never Heard Back From Customer Service,"This was the worst thing we have ever purchased. It arrived damaged on five pieces, also missing two screws in the needed color. I emailed them twice and never heard back. I called them and they said they never received my emails and could I resend the pictures. This was after four days of having the box at our house and Christmas a few days away. We had no choice but to put it together. If we'd waited for new pieces ( that is assuming they would make right the damaged product they sent us) Christmas would have been long gone. To receive replacement parts, of damaged parts, would require disassembling the set. This whole thing was a nightmare.<br />It took over eight hours to put together. You have to unpack many pieces, lay them out and nothing goes in numerical order. You may need part 1 with part 39. There are I don't know how many screws.... We finally put them each by letter in individual Baggies and lettered them and it still took eight hours. A woman can not do this alone unless you are very strong. You still need two people in parts. Not a single written instruction in spite of all the steps. The screws are made out of a hard plastic and are almost impossible to screw in unless you are practically Superman, such cheap cheap quality. My husband and I approached this as a doctor and nurse. He put it together, I read the instructions and handed him the pieces. Shame on KidKraft for shipping out damaged pieces, making something so tedious to assemble and the poor quality of manufacturing.<br />A huge disappointment and frustration.

She def uses her imagination as I got her some pots & pans (I bought Melissa & Doug & they're the perfect size) and fake food as well. Assembly took me & my hubby about 4 hours working together only stopping for a quick dinner & to put our toddler to bed. It wasn't too hard, just time consuming as there is a ton of parts. My only complaint is the instructions are just pictures so the screws on the outside are supposed to be like a bronze color (to mimic the &#34;wood) and the inside they are silver but putting it together it doesn't specify which colors go where so we had some mismatched screws which my OCD made me go back & fix.

My nephews are really hard on it as is my daughter when she visits and, aside from the knobs on the stove no longer functioning, it's still in great shape. So MIL bought the set for my daughter too. Within a week, with us watching, my two year old pulled the dishwasher door apart. The particle board just disintegrated. She was not being rough with it - just opening it. We contacted the company who sent a replacement door. The replacement didn't match the rest of the set. It too broke within a week. The same thing happened with the refrigerator door. She opened it (she wasn't being rough) and it snapped at the hinges. The older set at my MIL's doesn't have the same issue. The quality of that one is much better than the new one. My husband is handy with wood. He wound up buying furniture grade plywood, re-using the hardware (including &#34;ice machine&#34; plastic), and making new doors. (lower fridge and dishwasher). They don't match perfectly, but they are much better than the garbage doors the set came with. I expect that he will have to replace the other two doors at some point in time so they will all match eventually.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PWDDgexvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PWDDgexvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PWDDgexvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGMNCSMEST5JWV7BQF3GN56FRORA,1475172807000,8,False

673,5.0,Awesome kitchen!,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my children (1yo and 4yo). The reason I chose this over a more kiddy colorful option is because it's going in the living room and I didn't want it sticking out too much since my cabinets are Espresso. And to be honest, it looks better than my own kitchen!<br />Upon arrival, the box was half open which was concerning to say the least, since returning it (if damaged) would be quite the hassle. However, once opened, everything was still structurally sound and in good condition. Do be wary, it's heavy! After reading a few of the reviews about it taking roughly 4hrs to build, I offered my kids to my parents on Christmas Eve so that I had ample time to build in peace and quiet before the festivities began.<br />I started off by carefully separating each piece and wiping them clean. The biggest complaint I have is that there were foam particles all over the place. Granted it did its job of protecting the pieces but it was annoying to deal with. Directions were picture driven and was rather straightforward. The pieces were somewhat easy to locate - some took longer because they drew them larger than what they would appear to be when looking at other pictures. I incorrectly installed some parts because the orientation of some parts was the same on both sides with a small variance but was easy enough to correct. In order to speed up my process, I did use a power drill with 3lb of torque on the parts that required screws. That setting seemed to hold everything nicely without over-tightening and possibly cracking the wood by hand.<br />All in all, it took me 3hrs! Great timing but man, I felt like I ran a marathon! My back was killing me. The wood feels really solid and sturdy. I would say that this is probably the most precisely cut item I've ever built. Everything just lined up perfectly and fit without any correction. The only issue I see with the build are the small screws that hold the door latches that clip the doors close. They are very short, making it easy to strip from the wood. I already had to replace one that fell off when I reopened a tight door. I feel after a few uses, these will eventually pull off and that gluing them will be a better option.<br />Other than a few things such as it not having any electronics or handles to move it around, I'd have to give this 5/5 stars. For the price, it's absolutely worth it. Per other reviewers, I added some touch lights to the oven and above the sink to give it more realism. Might do the same for the fridge and/or microwave in the future. I supplied my kids with pots/pans/foods to go along with it. My kids love it and it's their favorite gift!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oS4D1+v4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oS4D1+v4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oS4D1+v4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xhwAmBOXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xhwAmBOXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xhwAmBOXL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AEHK3FLA74YG7DLDKVAB56OE66NQ,1545838265690,11,True

Upon opening the box I right away noticed some of the prices were slightly scratched, no big deal… directions for assembly were mostly east to understand but it did take about 3-4 hours total to complete assemble. The faucet on the sink and the ice maker are both made of cheap soft plastic and both take the same included small blunt screws which really just tore up the plastic. The faucet I had to use a dremel attachment for my drill to pre-drill holes so the screws would actually catch and hold, even then I had to improvise with one of them using a longer screw and a washer. I’ve maker, same issue but was in able to use a dremel or longer screws as it would have come through the front, I was gentle but still the plastic broke where the screws would be and i had to glue the ice maker in place, hopefully it holds. Definitely manufactured with very cheap materials..<br /><br />All in all, it’s a cute kitchen but I don’t think it will last in the long run. Will likely become an outdoor toy and will be replaced after a month or two.

This included a few short breaks as well as a lunch break and a little play time with my grandson.<br />After the small parts were installed on the larger pieces, the large pieces were carried downstairs to be assembled in the play room.

(I just love them because they will outlast this kitchen.) I ordered the wrong size for dishwasher area.  I wanted 2 wide bins for dishwasher, but you can customize however you want.<br />* Update I did not need as many Uline bins.....the wider ones would have been helpful in dishwasher<br /><br />My child loves bins, and honestly I bought this particular kitchen because of the large amount of storage.  I want all the accessories to be stored inside.<br /><br />I plan on storing the pretend mixer and coffee pot on the shelf on the top.<br /><br />I think I will get some lights like the other reviewers to illuminate the kitchen a bit more.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+s-fm9BHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+s-fm9BHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+s-fm9BHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71A8Se9olKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71A8Se9olKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71A8Se9olKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JQ7WnysFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JQ7WnysFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JQ7WnysFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cYmA810vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cYmA810vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81cYmA810vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fKlpbe1WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fKlpbe1WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fKlpbe1WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFCRU7GAWGNQBGULZEMVJEPLWCLA,1608495670405,8,True

My kids were pestering me from noon to 6pm, is it fone yet?<br />There are different color screws so pay attention to that if you want to match the brown screw to the brown color where seen. And there are steps inside each step that need done first and in a certain order and there are no words in the instructions to tell you these things. You just find out when you have to take it apart again lol.<br />BUT THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS the screw holes on the inside fridge wall peice are off by almost 1/4 inch. And this causes the separator piece between the fridge and freezer and top of freezer to be installed on an angle so that the freezer door will not close. Very disappointed considering this was near the last of the steps and was all ready getting tired of putting it together.

Today I opened it to begin putting it together and only took out 5 pieces.  3 out of these 5 pieces are clearly damaged and it is obvious that the company KNEW they were damaged and instead of recycling the pieces and providing new pieces and therefor a quality product, they did a slapdash job of smearing some stain/paint/whatever over the damaged places and threw them in the box with everything else.  I'm not even going to bother taking any of the other pieces out.  I'm outside of the window for returns since I waited until now to unbox the item (bad planning on my part, clearly).  I should have gone ahead and opened the box right when it arrived to make sure it was as it was supposed to be--my mistake for expecting to receive a product that wasn't damaged and poorly patched.

However, the instructions don’t indicate which screws go on which parts and it is unclear which pieces Will end up on the interior versus exterior. Therefore, I had to replace some of the screws when I thought the project was completed. There are 174 total screws bolts nuts and clasps.

872,5.0,Fantastic!,"This play kitchen is awesome! I spent DAYS researching and reading reviews for play kitchens before settling on this one. I had narrowed my search down to either this one or the smaller KidKraft kitchen, but finally caught a good price for this one and went for it. After purchasing it, receiving it and assembling it, I ran into the smaller version in a store. Boy was it small! I have a tall 2.5 year old, and I don't think he would've fit at that other kitchen for much longer. SO pleased that we went with the larger kitchen for a little more money.<br /><br />This kitchen has tons of storage space for all those tiny items you buy to go along with it. That was the main reason we chose this kitchen. The plastic options don't have much for storage, and I don't know about other parents out there, but we already have enough toys laying around the house. I don't need all the small plastic food and utensils strung about the house either. Additionally, this kitchen is so much more realistic and sturdy. My son is very particular and LOVES when his toys completely mimic adult items, like tools, vacuum cleaners, brooms, tractors, trucks. You name it, he wants it to be like the real thing! So this kitchen is great. It's not an eyesore and it looks a lot more like Mommy & Daddy's kitchen. The quality is great. I fear one of those plastic kitchens would only take a couple years of toddler abuse before needing to be tossed. This kitchen, however, will likely be passed down to grandchildren or kept around for grandchildren someday.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, it does take a long time to assemble. My husband and I tackled it in about 2-3 hours one evening after the boys were in bed, and we had no issues. We had one problem with a piece - the 2 pieces that hold the towel bar were not drilled correctly so we weren't able to attach it. Very minor annoyance, and I'm sure if we contacted KidKraft they would send replacement pieces out immediately (as they've done for other reviewers). But, quite frankly, we added that to the to-do list and just never got around to it.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with the purchase, quality, and design of this product. It's sturdy, large enough for several children, and will last and grow with them due to it's size and construction. Love it! I highly recommend!

875,3.0,"Looks nice, would never order again","We bought this kitchen because it matched our boys furniture. It looks different from the rest and we were excited to set it up. The box weighs more than an average woman can lift. 85lbs I believe. Then we opened it and saw that EVERY SINGLE SCREW had to be assembled. There was over a hundred screws and 40-50 pieces. It took two people (who are pretty intelligent and regulars at put together furniture) over 3 hours. That is no exaggeration. It may have been closer to 4. We gave up one night and went back at it the next day. I am certain we had an argument at some point because we were both so frustrated.<br /><br />Once assembled it is a charming little kitchen. Again, just know going into it that assembly is difficult and a little confusing. It almost requires two people to balance pieces. I will say that the paint finish is a little disappointing. The silver scratches very easily. My two toddlers are not rough on things and yet they have already worn some off in a few weeks.

We only had problems with one bolt--the shelf under the microwave was hard to square up and we got 3 out of 4 bolts in but the 4th wouldn't go in straight so it sticks out in the back of the freezer (fortunately, out of the way).  Past experience with KidKraft customer service has been good, but I just didn't feel like bothering with this one.

Obviously those would be outside facing. How someone attached their door upside down and got the company to accept blame and replace it, I have no idea.

There are also a few pieces that have slight size differences.  We made a couple of poor choices and ended up having to improvise.

I will admit putting this kitchen together was a little overwhelming at first and it took several hours. I would recommend having at least one other person to help. No matter how frustrating it is believe me, it is worth it!.I really love how this kitchen doesn't have any stickers. I absolutely hate how all of the plastic kitchens have stickers all over them. The graphics on this kitchen are painted on which is awesome in my book! Also all of the oven and stove knobs click when turned. The sink handle moves up and down. The only thing I dislike about the sink is that the sink basin shifts. I plan on using some glue under the lip to fix that issue though. The paper towel/hand towel holder is great other than the fact that the stick is way smaller than the holes so it is easily removed by nearly 2 year old. I just don't like the idea of my son running around the house with a wooden stick. This shouldn't be a problem with older children. My absolute favorite part of this kitchen is the stove burners. They are made out of 2 different pieces of plastic which give it a realistic look. The counter top is white with silver speckles. The espresso colored laminate particle board has a wood grain finish which is absolutely beautiful! All of the silver colored appliances have no wood grain which also gives this kitchen a more realistic look. The &#34;gray brick&#34; backsplash  is made of laminated particle board as well which was a pleasant surprise. I thought it was going to be laminated cardboard.<br /><br />The counter height of the kitchen is 22 inches<br />The counter length is 32 inches<br />The inner width of the freezer and fridge is 10 inches<br />The overall height of the kitchen is approximately 40.5 inches<br /><br />The play food and play pots and pans in the photos are by Learning Resources.

People complain about the instructions (or lack of)... but if you just go through the check list at the beginning, sort your parts, follow the picture stile instruction that tell you to attache a numbered piece to a numbered screw or other hardware or attachment, it's really not too difficult. I finished in just under 3 hours (including breaks) by organizing all my parts and taking my time to read ahead through the instructions before starting. The kitchen came together perfectly with no holes misaligned and no miss in my or extra pieces... very well crafted and sturdy... the only bad thing I can say is that when I originally ordered this product through amazon it was fulfilled by a different companny that never sent me my package and amazon replaced the order for me free of charge after they started selling it.

The structure itself is solid and sturdy, and the assembly was fairly straightforward, but there were many components to keep track of.  Most of the kitchen is wood and the finishings are plastic (handles, windows for the oven and microwave, sink, faucet etc)<br />Definitely grab a drill for this, the screws are tightly fitted so I'm confident they won't loosen over time. The play food that comes with it is not the greatest quality, a little flimsy, but it's a nice little set to start off with.

It does take some time to put together. I'm pretty good at following picture instructions, I always put together Ikea furniture and it took me 3 hours. The only problem I ran into was that on some hardware there are two different colors of the same item. The directions don't tell you which ones to use so you have to use your best judgement or it'll look weird. I didn't realize this at first and had to go back and replace some with the correct color.

1064,5.0,We love our KidKraft Uptown Espresso Kitchen Playset!,"Received Monday. I (Elisabeth) spent about 3-4 hours on Tuesday to put it together. My daughter received it as her fourth birthday present on Thursday after months of requesting. We are in love with it.<br /><br />1. Aesthetically very pleasing. The only place we had for it was in our living room. We chose this set because it gets fantastic reviews, but also because it worked with our décor and doesn't look like a big clunky toy in the middle of the room. We also love that it's gender neutral. It's like a &#34;real&#34; modern kitchen. I daycare out of our home, so this will be an exciting toy for many years.<br /><br />2. Quality. This thing came as a kit, but the hardware and materials are of amazing quality. Done correctly, and played with basic care, this set should last for years and years to come. Very solid set that should be able to take the abuse the kids will throw at it.<br /><br />3. Features. Fridge/freezer OR cupboard, ice maker, chalk board, microwave, back splash, hanging knobs, burners, stove and oven knobs &#34;click click&#34; when turned, sink with moveable faucet and handle, dishwasher/cupboard, oven, towel rack. Lots to do.<br /><br />4. Storage. We bought a large pack of food. Also bought a package of little storage containers that coordinated with the set to put the food in. Got everything in the fridge and freezer with room to spare. We also ordered a pot and pan set, but were disappointed with it. We are returning it for a better set, but there will be plenty of room for it in the dishwasher. My daughter had a tea set and picnic set that she's already brought out to play, and they sit prettily on top or on the shelf. Lots of storage left for some more pieces (dishes, dish rack, chef outfit, mixer, etc), probably for Christmas.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. I read some reviews that state the doors are hard to get on if they get wrenched off. I can see this being an issue. I do believe that if you run into this problem, you'll have to loosen some bolts and screws to slide the door back on and then retighten them. I hope we don't have a door bust off, but if we do that will be my plan of action.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61I0S5GcNlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61I0S5GcNlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61I0S5GcNlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hA9TMfyjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hA9TMfyjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hA9TMfyjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFCRTBJOA7PRODZJMLNNY3SHV5WA,1471617253000,8,True

Back to the kitchen... it took me (a mechanic by trade) 4 hours to put it together, so be prepared... it's not difficult just tedious and intricate and could use two people on some sections though I made it work with just myself. For some sections you have silver hardware and others brown--pay attention to when you're using the silver or the brown because at the very end you need 5 brown screws for the top and I only had silver left and because I'm anal, I went back and got the brown screws out of different sections just so I could have them for the top. This unit has some weight to it which is the main reason I asked the grands to get this versus the plastic ones.. my son is a wild animal and would rip those apart in a heartbeat.

1135,3.0,Nice Little Kitchen.,"I purchased this kitchen for my step daughter for her 5th birthday. 1st the pros: it's a nice kitchen. Looks modern and fairly real as far as play kitchens go. The finish is nice and after put together seems pretty sturdy. Here are my issues with the kitchen: 1. I wish the instructions were just a but more detailed. It wasn't hard to put together, just time consuming. The instructions only have illustrations, no words telling you what to do. Just me, but I think it could have been a lot easier to assemble with actual directions along with the illustrations. 2. Three of the pieces of our kitchen were damaged. One of the boards inside the fridge has a crack (not a big deal since it's not really seen) but the top shelf is cracked completely from one side to the other and it's pretty noticeable. There was also a small chip in the countertop. 3. Not that it's a huge deal, but for over $100 I think you should be able to press the buttons in. The knobs turn and that's cool, but everything else is just painted on. Or hard plastic parts. I've had other (way cheaper) kitchens that have buttons that press in. Just my thoughts. Kids like things the more real they seem. And paint on a board is just sort of blah for the money spent. All in all I think it's a cool looking kitchen and believe my girl will enjoy playing with it. Hopefully we will get a lot of use out of it. I took a star away for the damaged pieces, and another for all the other stuff.

1141,4.0,Patience Required,"I bought this after reading hundreds of reviews for various kitchen play sets. The single most important factor in making my decision was that I didn't want it to be too short/small for my toddler to use for any length of time. Luckily, while she is tall (38 inches), this kitchen is taller, and I feel she will be able to play with it for a couple of years at least. The second factor while purchasing was that this was one of the few kitchens with a non-obnoxious color scheme. We are keeping the play set close to our actual kitchen so I can keep an eye on things, and this kitchen does not draw the eye with loud colors.<br /><br />Yes, it takes a while to assemble. My husband and I are pretty decent at putting things together, and it took us both three solid hours to assemble this kitchen. As some reviewers have mentioned, pay attention to the colored screws. They go on the panels that face outward. It just makes everything look prettier.<br /><br />Separate compartments for the freezer, fridge, oven and dishwasher mean your child has plenty of storage space to stow play food and accessories (not included).<br /><br />The play set seems pretty solid, and my toddler has to exert some force to open and close the doors. I'm sure that will loosen up in time though.<br /><br />I took off a star because our set came without the towel bar on the side. I'm going to call KidKraft and let them know; if they give me a prompt resolution I will change my rating.<br /><br />Overall I feel this was a worthwhile purchase and I'd recommend it to a friend.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFHBDFGDRJW3S3M5Q75Q6KV2URLA,1412789125000,6,True

It is packed extremely well to preclude damage in shipment and the parts needed for assembly are packed for easy identification as you progress through the assembly schematic/instructions.  You really need 2 people to put this together as one will need to hold the sections in place as the other secures bolts, screws, etc.  Expect 4+ hours assembly time!!!

I would have given it 5 stars at this point if- 1- the instructions were written out and more clear, and 2- one of the holes had lined up better.  Something caused the holes for one of the shelves in the refrigerator to line up incorrectly, so the door sticks a bit.  Every other piece of assembly up to that point went smoothly, it just took a long time.<br /><br />Advise for assembly:  1.  USE A DRILL.  2. On step 27 it tells you to put the right wall for the microwave on.  Do this BEFORE you put on the shelf that acts as the bottom of the microwave, or your screwdriver/drill (like mine) won't fit under it to put it on and you'll be cursing kidkraft for a little bit.<br /><br />Since this kitchen doesn't have lights or sound, I bought battery operated GE LED touch activated puck lights and stuck them to the underside of the inside of the fridge and oven.  The one for the oven, I colored over the light with a red sharpie and let dry overnight (the lights are cool to the touch) so that the oven glows red inside.

I have assembled a lot of stuff over the years and I am very impressed with the quality of this product. The assembly hardware itself is of a very high quality for this level of toy.  That does not mean that it is not constructed with materials that can be damaged during the assembly process if you over tighten or don't take the time to line up and or thread the fasteners properly. I only had one goof while putting it together in that some of the screws are silver and some are painted to blend in with the unit and had to repeat one step. Also my box was in very bad shape when it was left at my house and I was very happy to find that the measures the manufacturer took to ensure that it would not be damaged all worked. My only wish that I have for the industry would be to offer a larger scale unit which I would be happy to pay for. Most of the larger units are in the molded plastic family and not our preference. As far as the other negative comments on the assembly go I take most of those with a grain of salt as I am sure those who assemble items like this have different skill levels. I find that if I take a good bit of time on the front end sorting the parts then the assembly goes much smoother. Every time I hit a snag I just took a moment to line up each of the features on the plans and except for the screw colors it all went to gather perfectly.

This is because every piece of trim you see, cabinet handles, nobs ect. all require assembly, nothing is bolted to any panel so everything that sticks out has to be attached separately.  I spent 45 minutes just on the 1st page.  If you enjoy assembling ikea furniture you will be right at home with this although the instructions are too sparse for my liking.  Something like this should be 30+ pages, this one has 15ish.  As mentioned by other reviewers, some screws of the same letter have different colors but the instruction does not make clear which you are suppose to use.  Other than that and the time it takes to assemble everything seems to be good quality.  A few nicks from shipping but nothing major.  DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN anything, this is a sturdy toy but too much torque will result in some connecting areas failing.  I did not have any but I can tell there are areas that would have given way if I kept tightening.  One thing that kept it from being 5 was there is a slight gap between the final horizontal piece that forms the top of the microwave and connects to the rod at the end.  Maybe I missed something but I was pretty careful I thought.

1294,3.0,Assembly instructions and quality control need work,"Since this is a Christmas gift, I have no play activity to report (yet), so just reviewing assembly.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this item takes a substantial investment of time to assemble (think of an overly complicated Ikea bookshelf) even with access to ratchets and power tools. Some of the milling on the wooden parts is imprecise, making the last few assembly steps (notably the back of the fridge and the top of the microwave), much more difficult to ""square up"" than they should have been.<br /><br />The biggest problem though, is the flimsy door latches supplied for all 5 ""appliance"" doors. The screw holes are milled too large, or the supplied screws are too tiny, so that in 3 of the 5 cases (dishwasher, microwave, oven), the first time the door is latched, pulling it open again pulled the latch off the door and left it in the cabinet ""grabber"" with screws exposed.  I haven't yet reached out to the manufacturer, but I don't see much of a solution available - replacing the doors with ones with smaller milled holes will require me to at least partially disassemble the unit - sending replacement latches or screws of the same size will just repeat the problem.<br /><br />Still ""playable"" without latches, but not as realistic or as safe, in my opinion.<br /><br />It seems a shame for a product with such a high cost and which looks so nice to be undone by flimsy $0.01 pieces of plastic, but there you go. Shipping the doors and framing pieces with latches and drawer slides and knobs preassembled would have been a good way to avoid these problems.<br /><br />I will update this review with any resolutions provided.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AEJQW2FKHGWFFNAW7J6ILY7SOKGA,1355970125000,6,False

Luckily my husband is mister fix it and was able to get the brads off and screw the hinge on correctly.<br /><br />The other pieces were in moderate condition.

Not including time taken to get the brads out of the hinge to correct the mistake.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Hci7uN1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Hci7uN1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618Hci7uN1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FT0E5z+yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FT0E5z+yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FT0E5z+yL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hBvVIWf6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hBvVIWf6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61hBvVIWf6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZDaLmm0rL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZDaLmm0rL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZDaLmm0rL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGYREUIAJ4EU2UJMA634AVNVRRMQ,1420400846000,13,True

As mentioned by others it takes a considerable amount of time to put together and the material from which it is made plywood is not very durable.  In the assembly stages the kitchen became easily scratched, so I doubt that it will last up to the intended age, or that it can be passed down to another child or family member.. For those that require words to construct items, you will find that the instructions consist mostly of pictures.  My husband took longer than the average 3-4 hours, mentioned by others, to put together but once completed the Kitchen looks nice and conserves space.  The packaging received was banged up and thus we had a few damaged pieces. I contacted the customer service number provided and Kidcraft quickly sent replacement pieces.

There were two pieces that were scuffed up but they were in the middle of other pieces in the box so this occurred at their packaging plant and not from the shipping. Despite the box looking like someone tried to eat it for lunch, the parts inside (with the exception of the two previously mentioned) were well packed and in good condition. There was also a very confusing spot with the back splash (see picture below). The picture instructions do not accurately show where the big grey box goes. We were lucky and figured it out so there was no disassembling to fix it.<br /><br />Now, the overall quality of the product seems to be fantastic. It is very well put together and unlike some products doesn't feel loose or wiggle when my boys play with it. There is a ton of storage within the kitchen. We've  only had the product for two days. However, my almost 3yr old is &#34;The Great Destroyer&#34; and the fact that it has lasted this long speaks volumes.<br /><br />Side note... when writing a birthday message for your kid before you attach it to the finished product, you might want to make sure it is going the correct direction.<br /><br />This kitchen comes with a freezer, fridge, (with built in ice maker) oven, dishwasher (that holds a removable cutting board), microwave, towel holder, phone (that looks an awful lot like an iPhone), 4 burners, sink, faucet. Everything that a child needs in their own, mini sized kitchen.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Tu3o6+5oL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Tu3o6+5oL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Tu3o6+5oL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XANuqPG0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XANuqPG0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XANuqPG0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v9ayHU27L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v9ayHU27L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v9ayHU27L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511QMNTdwsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511QMNTdwsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511QMNTdwsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bf72UhLVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bf72UhLVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bf72UhLVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51at14TJxrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51at14TJxrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51at14TJxrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cbNtp7lvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cbNtp7lvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cbNtp7lvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51itvamSoeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51itvamSoeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51itvamSoeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51psSeZsilL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51psSeZsilL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51psSeZsilL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PYqcXfULL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PYqcXfULL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PYqcXfULL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFRN5VUQEPQK4WHONNL54W5ANMEA,1454214645000,4,True

After it was all assembled I swapped out some of the screws to use the brown ones in visible areas and the silver ones in hidden areas.

1442,4.0,Classy Kitchen Toy,"The only downfall to this unit was the packaging and poor handling. Because this unit weighs in at about 75 lbs it is suceptable to shipping damage. In my case it was extensive damage resulting in transfer damage to the actual product inside the package. There were roughly 10 softball size holes on the package I received. Several panels inside the package were scratched along the sides and the bottom inside panel that spans the entire unit was moderately bowed. The box had one small piece of tape left in tact holding the top of the cardboard lid on. When I picked it up to bring inside the house everything inside nearly fell out. I called amazon and since it was a 3rd party vendor all they would do was pay UPS to ship back and have them pick up, but for $160 and being a prime item I felt that there should be more wiggle room considering I received a damaged product. My refund would have been 7-13 days and my next order would arrive after my daughters birthday. Eventually after 1.5 hours of negotiaons I recieved a 50% refund of the product and a garunteed full reimbursement if the product inside was damaged beyond a reasonable amount (which varies person to person). I was satisfied with the outcome of the situation and assembled the unit this evening.<br /><br />Assembly was fairly easy and straight forward. About 2 hours total to put together and only a few minor issues with the flow of the install instructions. A stubby Phillips screwdriver will come in handy in a couple areas of assembly as will a drill with a Allen head apex bit size 5/32"". The only main area of concern is the tray for the play oven. The opening of the oven door (which swings open like a cabinet, instead of dropping down like a real oven) prevents the easy install and remove of the tray within the channeled bracket. I simply placed the tray on top of the groved bracket to make removal for sanitizing easier. If you manipulate the install flow and save the inner bracket for last the tray will be permenetly installed and not removable without removing 2 Phillips screws and the bracket. A minor issue that doesn't change the quality of this toy. It is a nice toy that my 2 year old will simply love to play with for a long time. Very happy with the overall outcome of my purchase and would purchase again knowing all of the above.<br /><br />I hope others find this review helpful.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFGRU4FOY6FZESGBPQEZ62BGXONQ,1405313988000,0,True

Parents dont wait until Christmas eve to try assembling this or you will be up all night!!<br /><br />Also pay attention to the other reviews.

1454,4.0,Fantastic Quality - Horrible to Assemble,"This was a Christmas gift from my parents to my daughters (ages 5 & 3).  I have to start by saying that my children LOVE it.  They've been playing with it nonstop since yesterday morning.  The kitchen is VERY sturdy and heavy and appears that it will last a long time.  Thus far, all of their Melissa & Doug-scaled toys fit well with it (we haven't pulled them all out yet to see.)  And I think the price is very reasonable, compared to a certain other play kitchen that is very popular, expensive, and reportedly not durable at all.  And it's pretty - I don't mind that it's proudly on display in our great room.  My only complaint is the length of time it took to assemble.  I had read other reviews that mentioned 2 hour assembly times, but it took my husband and father 4 1/2 hours.  (They're reasonably handy with tools, so I don't think it was lack of skill on their part!)  The instructions were VERY vague - evidently very little explanation.  Just sketches.

My brother is VERY Technical and has build everything from Custom speaker boxes to repairing blu-ray players and computers. He told me that if you were to scale this as Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced this definitely would be an advanced build. As the other reviews have stated some parts did not get drilled correctly so the holes did not match up. Actually on the dishwasher the door was drilled on opposite sides so he had to drill his own hole in order to assemble the product correctly.<br /><br />After we saw the product it looks absolutely amazing. I cannot tell you about sturdiness because my daughter will not be able to play with it until tomorrow. I will attempt to update my review at a later time if i remember.<br /><br />Overall the product is worth it, especially for the 129.99 price. Most kitchen sets around this or cheaper are pure crap. The tile on the back of the kitchen looks real, also so does the ""Marble"" counter tops. I would highly recommend this purchase for any child, especially if you plan on putting this in your own kitchen and dinning room and want something that looks descent.<br /><br />I would of given this four stars for overall if it did not take my brother close to 4-5 hours of assembly time. (Also as noted the box they chip it in is pure crap. The sides were falling apart when we received the item.)<br /><br />*****UPDATE 06/23/2014*****<br />My daughter has now used this product for almost a year, I would say this product has held up to my tough standards.

1519,4.0,"Gorgeous kitchen, headache to set up","I snatched up this kitchen when I saw it on sale.  It had been on my radar for a while as a potential birthday gift for my daughter.  My husband and I built it last night and it came out beautiful, but was a headache to set up.  Some of the pieces did not match up such as the latch for the microwave door and my husband had to drill new holes instead of using the prefabricated holes in order to make the door latches line up when closed (we could have asked for another door but it would have halted further assembly and would take up to 5 days to arrive).  There was also 2 sets of screws missing, but I called the company this morning and they are shipping out the missing parts free of charge.  I was quite impressed that they answered after the first ring.  I suspect missing parts are a common occurrence as they had a whole sheet come with the product detailing how to contact them for missing parts.<br />Anyway, the set up was a pain and made for a long profanity filled night.  We have assembled many other toys and furniture ourselves before but this product was was full of assembly issues.  Some of the directions did not make sense in terms of the order they want you to put the pieces in place.  For example, the instructions did not tell you to slide the backing for the refrigerator in place untill after everything was screwed in tight.  This resulted in us having to unscrew certain screws to loosen it up in order to fit the piece in and then screw everything back.  The biggest headache was that assembly requires you to screw in a lot of the parts upside down blindly and with some of the last portions of set up the screw driver does not even fit in to small space to tighten things in so we had to improvise and use the drill portion of our swiss army knife.  Overall, it took 3.5 hours to set up.  They shipped everything in a compact box.  All the knobs and parts that stick out had to be individually screwed in.  Think Ikea assembly time times 10.<br />It is a beatiful product and my daughters will get a lot of use out of it.  Compact but with enough storage for tons of playfood and cookware.  My daughter is 2 years old and 70% percentile for height and can reach all the knobs and access all the doors (which do stick a little but probably will loosen after a while).  There is enough counter and room space for multiple children and will probably last them till age 8-9 or whenever they get tired of pretend play.  The design is aesthetically pleasing (looks more modern than my real kitchen) and can fit into any decor.  I am pleased, but did not enjoy the set up.<br />Note that they will only cover replacements 90 days from purchase and there are no other warranties.  Make sure you set it up soon after you get it so you know if you'll need replacement parts and don't throw out the sheet with the customer service number and item batch number.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFYBNQB3APTN4EVNIJOY5BAC6BNA,1377188578000,2,True

1552,5.0,"Sturdy, Quality Product","We bought this for our son last Christmas right when he turned 2.  He's very large, so all the other play kitchens out there would have been too short for him.  This one was definitely worth the extra money!  It's nicer than my own kitchen, and my son has a great time telling me what he's cooking, and constantly opens and closes all the doors.<br /><br />It did take my husband forever to set this up.  He thought it would go much faster, so he didn't start putting it together until about 11pm Christmas eve, and he wasn't finished until around 3am.  So make sure to leave plenty of time to put it together!  However, even though it was a pain in the butt for him, he still says it was worth it.<br /><br />Before making this purchase, because of the cost I put a lot of thought and research into it.  My son is very into cooking and being in the kitchen, so I decided it was worth it.  He has played with the kitchen every single day since Christmas, so it's already paid for itself.  The kitchen looks just like it does in the pictures and he loves all the &#34;high-end finishes.&#34;  He's almost 3 now, and is as big as a 5-year-old, so I am glad we went with this kitchen, as he would have outgrown the others within weeks of getting them.  We do also have an almost one-year-old who loves to play with the kitchen as well.  It's lasted 8 months now under heavy playing by two boys, so I imagine it will hold up for another few years until they outgrow it.<br /><br />Side note, if your kids make a huge mess and then someone drops by unexpectedly, you can also quickly shove a bunch of toys into all the cabinets and it makes a great storage facility as well!I<br /><br />EDIT 10/2020: My boys played with this kitchen for 5 years, then we donated it to their younger cousins.

I had read the Good, the bad and the ugly reviews and I felt confident about ordering this kitchen.  The box was very well packed and nothing had been damaged in transit.

Once I did a complete inventory of all the pieces I had a good look at the instructions.<br />I can understand why people get upset about how long it takes to assemble.  It's quite tedious, but it is a very well manufactured product. My advice is to take your time and don't rush it.  I had a good time assembling all the pieces and it was fairly easy to follow the instructions. In all, it took me 3.5 hours from start to finish. Just set aside plenty of room and to lay everything out.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think it's fair to say that KidKraft has taken the negative reviews seriously and they have addressed all the problems other people have had with the product.

1583,4.0,Fun kitchen - but not as indestructable as I hoped,"We purchased this last year for Christmas. My husband and I are pretty much experts at assembling boxed furniture - but this one took about 2 1/2 hours to complete.  The kitchen does seem well built when you put it together, but we quickly found that there are a few flaws with the design.  They were:<br />1. Instead of attaching the hinge pieces on the doors with screws, the come riveted on from the factory.  At first, this seemed great because it was one less step to complete to put it together.  However, within 4 (yes 4) days of giving it to the kids, our oldest child (who is 4) ran into the open oven door, and broke it off at the hinge.  While I could probably find a way to fix the door - I would have to completely disassemble the kitchen back to step 3 to re-install it.<br />2. The sink is able to be pulled out - but isn't really designed to be because of the way the plastic nubs that hold it in place... I'm expecting any day that those will break off<br />3. The towel bar is removable - which again seems good, but quickly became a sword for our son and needed to be removed<br />Other than that, our kids have fun with it, and it is a good size for them. Plus it does have lots of space to put dishes and play food, which is great.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHPYWSYBEU4PLJK7JSNXV3Q7SGTA,1388891392000,0,True
1584,5.0,Assembly is not for the faint of heart,"Our 4 ¾ year old granddaughter had asked for a play kitchen about a month ago, so I ordered this with Plan Toys assorted fruits and vegetables, dMelissa and Doug's stainless steel pots and pans, and their Wooden Sandwich Making Set. As she had opened them before seeing the large box wrapped on the other side of the room, she said &#34;But I really want a stove!&#34;. We all smiled.<br /><br />The uptown espresso kitchen was every bit as good when completed as I had expected.<br /><br />The box itself is extremely heavy, but everything is well packed and labeled. The instructions will seem familiar to anyone who has assembled lots of IKEA furniture, but they could have been more clear.<br /><br />They don't use words, just numbers and pictures to describe what to do. So in certain diagrams. they are showing you  few different parts to install before moving to the next diagram. But in some cases, the order in which you assemble those pieces matters.<br /><br />There were several areas of particular trouble-<br /> •Installing the countertop, which I wound up reinstalling maybe five times before getting it all right. When I thought I had it all done, I realized that you really need to pre-install the round pipe support that holds the right end of the microwave shelves before you install the counter, so that you have access to the screw under that piece.<br />•The low and upper shelf components for the Microwave. I had to go back an loosen a lot of fittings, in order to get the microwave door hinges to fit right within the two shelves, and then tighten them all up again.<br />•Installing the top and back panels of the Freezer required loosening everything and then tightening in a specific order.<br /><br />Finally, when I looked over what pieces were remaining, I realized that I missed two latches, but fortunately, they were easy to install out of sequences.<br /><br />As an architect, woodworker, and rather experienced assembler of things over the years, I was surprised that it took over four hours to assemble properly. Part of the reason is that pieces were strewn all over the living room floor, and with the chaos of Christmas, it was a little distracting. I chose to do this by myself, soliciting my granddaughter's help a few times to hold the doors in place while I assembled the upper shelves or aprons that held them in place. I also like things to fit well, ad in a few instances, I had to go back and loosen things so that everything could wiggle a little, and then tighten it all up again.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Absolutely. She loves it.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHFAXKHNEOJTBARZTLIHZN3MHAUA,1482807545000,3,True
1585,5.0,Kids love it! Assembly takes some time - very sturdy,"Both of my children love it! 4 years old and almost 2.... they can't get enough of clicking the dials for the stove, and using the working paper towel dispenser. We bought some of the Melissa / Doug cookware and other kitchen toys and they go together very well. This kitchen is sturdy and has a lot of detail. Highly recommend - however the assembly takes some time.<br />Assembly tips:<br />- Have a very large area ready for this install, on carpet if possible (garage floor or tile might scratch the dark finish) when you think that you have a large enough area, keep clearing floor space!<br />- The kitchen can easily be moved after assembly by 2 people.<br />- Use a drill / electric screwdriver with a 'low torque' setting, snug up screws by hand to avoid stripping the particle board. There are a LOT of fasteners, using a drill will really speed things up.<br />- There are brown fasteners and silver fasteners that will work with multiple steps in the directions, but the brown fasteners are for use in area where the wood is visible. This is not specified in the directions (at least I didn't see it)<br />- If you are unsure what orientation a part goes (the counter top support for example) look ahead in the directions. The later steps will help answer questions<br />- Allow for multiple hours to assemble. Don't leave this for Christmas Eve assembly! I had at least 4 hours into this project.<br />- Self adhesive 'tap' lights work well with the kitchen to brighten it up.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGRVK76J6MT6FKTUJ5WGWU6YSEMA,1420650685000,0,True

1587,3.0,"Good kitchen, but not as pictured","I bought this kitchen in 2013 and again now. No real complaints about the 2013 purchase aside from it being time consuming to assemble. It was sturdy and survived a lot of play, but it was dirty and had been drawn on with Sharpie and I decided to replace it rather than move it to another house.<br /><br />The kitchen I got today is not the same one pictured for sale. The pegs are no longer part of it, nor is the shelf in the dishwasher section. The pole on the right side is a thin plastic. Could have sworn that the old one was metal but KidKraft insists they only use wood and plastic. At any rate, it’s thin, poor quality plastic.<br /><br />Neither KidKraft nor Amazon could tell me why the kitchen I got is not the same as the kitchen pictured (both websites have the same picture). I suppose they changed the design and didn’t bother to change anything else.  KidKraft’s answer was maybe Amazon had old stock but that seems unlikely since the old one i has was the one pictured. To their credit, Amazon gave me a partial discount. I certainly wasn’t going to disassemble and pack it up and ship it back (plus the puppy had already started chewing on the box).<br /><br />Overall it’s a good kitchen. This one was easier to assemble than the old one. It’s only screws, no hex bolts and took about 1.5 hours. Just be aware that you might not get what you expect if you order this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fvM+rO0oL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fvM+rO0oL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fvM+rO0oL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHLYDULA4PPYMWVFBM64I3UJ2PJQ,1602624419496,1,True

I have supplemented this with buying pots that make the sound and other  play accessories that make the sound.<br /><br /> Also the covering that is pretending to be a glass oven window is very flimsy. My son accidentally kicked it and now it is buckling. Other than this,  I am pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />A few things i do like...<br /><br />This set is that it is tall. My son is 42 inches tall and he is eye level with the freezer. Inside the kitchen in I am assuming the dishwasher portion  (the door next to the stove) there is a cutting board that can be taken out and replaced. so this was a nice little touch. I also like tha this is wooden and it is heavy and sturdy. I am confident that it is less likely to fall on top of my son, but they do have the hook that comes with it so that it can be attached to the wall and prevent this from happening.

I admit it is meticulous work--it took me about 3 hours to fully assemble but I can see where if you have a fast food mentality and just want it done and done now, this is not going to be a project you want to take on.  Boy was it worth it though to see my daughter's eyes light up when she saw it.

Not a big deal- she will get bored of that quickly. Also, the phone has no chord. I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before its lost.<br />All in all I like this kitchen and would recommend it!

It is so nice looking that I don't mind it being in my dining room because the colors match our furniture!  It did take a few hours for assembly, but worth it in the end.  This is a nice size for my daughter now and for her to grow into.  What I probably love most is the amount of storage space.  Other kitchens have rather small spaces for the ovens, fridge, etc.  This easily fits her Melissa and Doug cookie sheets and cupcakes, and stores all of her food, pots and pans, dishes, with room for more!  Toaster or coffee sets, etc. could easily be stored as well.  I also really like that there is a bit of counter space since my daughter will use that to assemble her play, few other sets have this.  The counter space being even a little longer would have been nice.  The paper towel holder can actually hold paper towels.  I bought the Kidkraft Metal Acessories set (pots and pans) to go with it and highly recommend those as well.  Very realistic looking and fit perfect on the burners.  They can also hang from the back splash pegs (although the pans are a little too long to hang, but can still place them there).  Also happy with purchase of Kidkraft plastic dish set.

I do want to say though it does take a pretty hefty time assembling BUT, it is WELL WORTH IT! It took my husband and I about 5 hours to put together but, that is because we were interrupted a few times by our two daughters and we also wanted to take our time and put it together as perfect as possible.

The height is perfect for my almost three year old daughter and my one year old has no problem either Cheffing' it up in the kitchen [she can't reach the shelf above the microwave but, that just gives her something to explore when she gets a bit taller!] I can see them having this kitchen for years to come with how well the construction is made and also the height of the kitchen is tall enough for them to grow into as well.

From unpacking to clean-up, it took exactly 3 hours for my husband and I to assemble.  We probably could have done it faster, but are pretty meticulous about organizing our parts, tools, and hardware before we start a project like this.  The assembly diagrams were actually pretty clear, although in a few places, we had to look ahead a few steps in order to see what direction a piece was supposed to be turned.  During assembly, there were a few times where we thought that something wasn't lining up correctly, but when we continued with the steps and tightened everything down according to directions, everything came into place.<br /><br />The kitchen is large enough that my 5.5 year old can enjoy it and I'm not worried she's going to out grow it at any moment. All of the Melissa and Doug toys we have fit with the set (for example, our cookie tray fits in the oven).

Those days are over for the grandchild who just turned 12 months old. It took sometime and patience to assemble but it's so worth it. I purchased lots of Melissa & Doug and Learning Resources food, dishes, etc. They all fit perfectly. For 12 months old she loves opening all the doors and putting the food, dishes in and out. My intention was to place it in her nursery, but after assembly, decided to keep it in the living room to watch her play with it. I purchased this before last Thanksgiving and she got to play with it for a week before they had to return to their long distance home. They returned for Christmas and she took up where she left off, now 13 months old at the time. I would HIGHLY recommend this kitchen for any child and entertainment for parents and grands to watch them play in their very own little kitchen. I'm glad I decided to purchase this high quality kitchen for her and the other future grands to enjoy as well.

I went ahead and bought it anyway and actually love the final product.  Yes, it did take a few hours of install, but I was able to do it even with an 18mos old playing and running around nearby.  Two problems I ran into:<br /><br />1) some screws are painted to match the outside would to help camaflouge it while others were silver and meant to be used in hidden areas.  I didn't know this and ending up using them in opposite areas which unless you're OCD, it will do.  Honestly, from a distance you can't even tell.<br />2) it came missing two parts.  The paper towel brackets were missing.  I called kidkraft and got through no problem, and they immediately sent me at no charge the missing parts.<br /><br />In all, it's a pretty kitchen and install was actually not too bad at all.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PE1W3wKnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PE1W3wKnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PE1W3wKnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFPH4UU6XJOJGZ3X2H7TKGRSG6IA,1478906036000,5,True

I bought this for my daughter's first birthday and while it was still a little too advanced for her, she did enjoy opening the doors and pulling herself up by the handles. It's seven months later and she LOVES her kitchen. It provides hours of play time for her, which let's face it, is great for me. 😂<br />The refrigerator, freezer, microwave, oven and dishwasher can all be opened and has shelves that can store other toys/play food. This was a huge bonus for us, it actually holds a ton of things and acts like a toy chest at the end of the day. The knobs for the stove and oven can all be turned, as can the faucet. There are some non functioning stickers but way less than they typical play kitchen - but there is a price to pay for that, and we will talk about it in a second. The phone can be taken off the hook, there are knobs on the backsplash to hold utensils, a functioning towel rack, shelf, and chalkboard. All things my toddler loves to use.<br />My only complaint about this kitchen is it takes FOR-EV-ER to build. All the pros about this kitchen make is a slight con while building it. There are 9 billion pieces and nothing is preassembled. It's not difficult to build, it's just annoying to build.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHQSBQC6CLYNPXWUIROYAAB6CMBA,1458579500000,6,True

It took me and my 17 year old son over 5 hours to assemble this, that is 4 hours too many. We were tired and bleary eyed by the time we finished on Christmas Eve. The other bad news: it was missing a burner, so that is a pretty obvious omission.  I had a hard time  getting through to customer service this morning, so I left them a voice message and sent them an email. So, hopefully they will send that part soon.<br />For the amount of assembly that is customer required, it should be a lot cheaper.  I looked at the assembly instructions online and they had 1/3 less parts that need to be assembled than the assembly instructions that came with our kitchen,  For instance, the stove top comes in one pre-assembled piece, whereas our package had approximately 20 pieces to add to the stove top.  Way too many big and little pieces and parts to put together!  The other negative: this kitchen comes with nothing- not one pot, not one item of food, not even a little oven mitt.

She is now four and a half and still plays with it. It's still sized appropriately and I don't see her outgrowing it any time soon.<br /><br />It's very sturdy and I love the colors. The knobs clack when you turn them which is a nice touch. She enjoys writing on the blackboard. The pegs are handy for hanging items onto. I like the fact that there is a refrigerator and freezer section, and believe me, she shelves her food accordingly! The burners are raised which i like. She has always loved the phone, the knob for the faucet turns, she love using the microwave and oven. The rod on the side comes in handy for hanging her dish towels on.<br /><br />Over all this is a great set in a good price range. I agonized over this decision and am pleased we choose the KidKraft brand.<br /><br />I will say she is not rough with her toys, but her younger brother is, but nothing has been broken and it seems to be indestructible!<br /><br />It went together easily and did not take very long at all.

I needed something sturdy, streamline (as we have a tiny place), and complete (everything a real kitchen would have.)  I feel like that is exactly what we got! We are very happy with the kitchen itself.  For that, we would have given 5 stars!<br />However, we are taking two stars for poor (and luckily for us on this christmas eve, fairly easily remedied) craftsmanship in some of the pieces and bad packaging. The box was barely holding together by the time it got to our home, but luckily, none of the pieces had escaped. One MAIN STRUCTURAL pieces was missing predrilled holes, so with fingers crossed and breathe held, we screwed directly into the piece hoping it wouldn't crack.  We will see if it holds up.  A few pieces were scratched and the towel bar holes are too large to secure the towel bar from being removed (maybe this is intentional).<br />Assembly did take a really long time. My husband spent about 4 hours putting it together.  However, the many many pieces are clearly labeled and the directions fairly easy to follow (if you can assemble an IKEA piece, you got this!)<br />All in all, I am delighted with our purchase and look forward to seeing the look on our 3 year old's face when he sees it!

(there were a couple other scratched parts but I didn't care to replace those since they were not as visible than the top piece.)<br /><br />My one year old daughter loves this kitchen and visits it frequently through out the day.

1926,2.0,All the worst of IKEA with none of the rewards.,"I'll make this as clear as I can ... DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM BY KIDKRAFT<br /><br />Their products (I have 2 of them now) come with nearly useless instructions. There are no words, just black and white pictures. You have to guess which way is which, often times by counting the visible holes and trying to eyeball which way is up based on alignment. Furthermore, the pictures sometimes show multiple steps in one picture, there is no way to tell which step needs to be done first. Then there are other pictures in which there is only 1 thing to do shown. This should be broken up much better, it would make things (marginally) easier to read.<br /><br />The various hardware pieces are nearly identical at times, leading to issues where you can't tell which piece is needed where. At least they are sealed in their own individual compartments, so it should be easy to keep things separate. But you can't! Why? Because opening one section means accidentally tearing open the neighboring section and the pieces all mix together.<br /><br />This company is also one of those places that (for reasons unknown to anyone with basic logic skills) provides no extra pieces for the small, easily lost and/or destroyed pieces but a few extras for the bigger, stronger pieces. This means you'll invariably reach a point where you either are missing something critical that can't be replaced with a trip to Home Depot or left with extra parts and confused what you forgot to do.

It took a good 45 minutes to carefully disassemble the box and lay out all the forty plus parts in order and peruse the pictorial directions. Before purchasing I read many of the reviews about assembly and they were very helpful when I put the kitchen together—hints about being careful to use the proper screw colors on the brown and silver pieces, etc. I  would add, if you don’t have a helper to hold parts in place, try using blue painter’s tape to hold parts steady. I also had a bar of soap handy to lubricate the screws if they did not go into the wood easily. In addition to the tiny wrench and the Allen wrench that comes with the kitchen, you only need a Phillips head screw driver. It was a labor of love to put this kitchen together. I am now saving Green Giant vegetable and small frozen pizza boxes to stock the freezer, also milk and butter cartons for the fridge. You can loosely fill them with small bunches of paper towels or aluminum foil and tape shut to keep their shape.  Went to the dollar store and got a small timer and and some wire baskets that look kind of like dishwasher racks for dishwasher. I purchased the KidKraft pots and pans which fit perfectly on the burners.

1934,5.0,Best kid's kitchen! Looks beautiful in the playroom.,"This is actually the second time we've purchased and put together this kitchen, because we love it so much. We donated the first one to a friend. He's a very tall almost-five-year-old, and he still adores it. You would expect most kids to have outgrown a pretend kitchen by now, but he still loves it. It looks like a real kitchen, so he feels like he's getting to be a grown up when he serves us pretend food! This is, hands down, the best kid's kitchen ever. Solid wood. Easy instructions. Although it takes a while to assemble, it's worth every minute. It's such a wonderful addition to my son's playroom! It looks so much nicer than the plastic ones, and my son loves that is has all the parts of a real kitchen.<br /><br />My one complain is that my son was so excited to have it put together and get to play with it that we went ahead with the assembly even after noticing that the &#34;new&#34; kitchen had several parts with scratches. One of the screws packets was taped up, which makes me think that we did not receive a new item. The phone had scratches. The sink had scratches. I'm hoping they'll send some replacement parts since I was under the assumption we were receiving a new product.

1938,5.0,Excellent Design and Assembly Instructions,"I have built many products over the years that come disassembled, tightly packed in cardboard boxes, that weigh quite a bit. This unit weighed in at about 70 pounds. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble, and I was amazed at how well the components were labelled, made, and most importantly, fit together. Without a doubt, this was the best designed partical board kit I have ever built. The instructions were spot on even though there were primarily only pictures to follow. Kidkraft really did an outstanding job numbering parts and coordinating them with the assembly instructions. Kidkraft suggests that you do NOT use a power drill/screwdriver to assemble this. I did. If you set the clutch on the driver to its lowest setting it will drive all the fasteners home with just the right amount of torque. Some of the smaller screws that attach to the ends of boards should be done by hand, however, even if one does strip, this kit is designed so that most every component has multiple fasteners holding it in place. After I finished this there wasn't a single door out of alignment, they all shut and latched securely and properly. This is a very well designed childs toy. Be patient assembling it and you will be well rewarded. I do wish that they provided some sort of battery system that could be used to create lighting and additional sounds for some of the components.

Took about 2 hours to put together, but that seems reasonable for the number of pieces and connections required.<br /><br />My complaints:<br />Instructions/packaging.  They have one of those cardboard blister packs with all the hardware many pieces.  they didn't label the back with the part number/letter.  so i had to keep flipping over to find it.  Also they had up to 3 different locations and ""types"" for a part.  one screw (part letter C?) was in 3 spots and they were 3 different screws.  well the length and thread were the same, but the head was either metal, white or brown.  Looking back, i should have noticed, but at 1am it wasn't my first though.  I wish they would have labeled like C.1 for white, C.2 for brown or something.  this way you know to grab the brown screw for securing a brown wood piece, etc.  since most of the screws will be hidden by the location of them and the position of the toy it isn't as bad.  but still, a little ocd gets me when i see a stainless head on the brown backing.<br /><br />also, the foam packing is a pain to clean.  it gets all static charged up and sticks and is a pain to clean.  expect to be finding pieces of white foam for months, unless you take your time and deconstruct everything.  i suggest building in a VERY open space.  this will allow for cleaning of the parts, and being able to spread them out and easily identify what pieces are which and what goes next.<br /><br />as for durability, it has been holding up.  Had a play-date a few days ago and 5 2yos were using and nothing broke.

2161,3.0,Good product but a few minor assembly annoyances,"First off, this thing is solid and looks great. I may be proven wrong by my kids, but this feels like it will last. I only deducted two stars because of to issues I had in assembly (note, assembly to me about 3 hours, including a short dinner break).<br /><br />I deducted one star because while the hardware package does a great job at identifying which bolts are A, E, or other letters in the instructions, there are two colors of bolts. The brown bolts should be used on the exterior and the silver bolts should be used on interior faces. This could be remedied by either giving different colors of the same bolt spec different letters (so you only use the silver on the interior faces) or by making all bolts brown. As a result, I got to the end and have five silver bolt heads exposed on a brown panel.<br /><br />I subtracted a second star because the poor quality of the bolts caused one to break during assembly. I had to use a cutoff wheel and screwdriver to extract the broken screw, adding 10 minutes to my install time. If I didn't own a Dremel this would not have been possible to fix.<br /><br />If Kidkraft fixes these two problems with their fasteners this will solidly be a five star product.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LgtU3mHEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LgtU3mHEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LgtU3mHEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Tm0OjUUIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Tm0OjUUIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Tm0OjUUIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hsprPIxuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hsprPIxuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hsprPIxuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFOVZCRM5ALOTVTU5ZGTDF7GMTBQ,1483236760000,0,False

2194,5.0,Awesome Kitchen!!!,"I love this kitchen (and so does my daughter)!!!  It took my husband and I about 2.5 hours to put together.  We're both engineers, so both pretty mechanically inclined.  I attached cabinet handles and hinges while he put together the main pieces.  It was definitely very helpful to have two people putting this together.  For the last few components, I had to force some of the pieces together to get the holes to line-up while my husband put in the screws.  Overall, everything went together very smoothly, but I guess along the way somewhere, something wasn't perfectly square.  Once together, you'd never know.  It looks perfect.  There are no stickers to attach.  The microwave and oven labels are painted onto the wood.  The quality is great.  The oven, fridge and dishwasher all have shelves, making for great storage space for the play food and dishes when we attempt to clean up the play room.  I would recommend this kitchen to everyone!

The kitchen is beautiful (much nicer than mine!) and very sturdy.  There is plenty of storage space to hold all his kitchen equipment - toy food, pots, pans etc. in the stove, fridge, freezer or dishwasher.  I love how real this kitchen looks - the appliances are all &#34;stainless steel&#34; with a &#34;granite&#34; counter.  This piece was designed very well with a lot of attention to detail.  There is a towel rack on the side, and hooks to hang utensils on behind the stove.  My baby loves to turn the burners and wash dishes in his sink.  This kitchen occupies him all day! He still likes to steal my pots though :)  I highly recommend this kitchen - especially for the low price offered on Amazon! The only downside I can think of is that it took my husband about 5 hours to assemble (but he's not really the handy type).  The instructions were easy to follow, just time-consuming.

There is a good amount of space to store things like food, pots, pans, dishes, etc. Another note in other reviews was that it was a bit taller than other play kitchens (which was preferred for us because our 3 year old is considerably taller than other toddlers and his baby brother is looking like he'll match that height in the coming years), and that held true. It's a great height now and looks like it will continue to be accommodating for a bit. It also looks great with our adult furniture, which seems a silly thing to worry about, but in our current living situation makes me very happy.<br /><br />Most importantly, my son loves it.

I still have it 5 stars because I didn't feel that one small chip was worth taking away a star with how much I love everything else about it. My 2 year old also climbs on it sometimes, and it has never even come away from the wall.

2226,5.0,Top Notch and Tons of Fun!,"Purchased this for my 2.5 year old daughter and as a toy my infant son can also grow to enjoy.<br /><br />I love that it is gender neutral and matches the decor of my home.  It is currently set up in my kitchen and my daughter loves to cook in it while I cook.  The height of the kitchen is perfect as nothing is too tall for my daughter right now and a 7 year old cousin has also been able to use it with ease.  This shows me that the kitchen will provide hours of fun far into the future.<br /><br />The only troublesome thing about this kitchen is that it will take some effort to put together.  In fact, I could tell that the kitchen we received had previously been returned.  It seemed someone opened it and found all the pieces too daunting and took it back.  Still, the kitchen we received had all the pieces and the directions were easy to follow.  In my opinion, four hours of installation is nothing for the countless hours of fun this activity center will provide.<br /><br />Other notes about the kitchen:<br />It is visually stunning and I get compliments on it whenever someone visits.<br /><br />The lack of lights and electronic features could be a con for some people, but I feel it encourages my daughter to use her own imagination.<br /><br />The lack of bright colors could also be seen as a con, but I think that the fact that her kitchen looks like mine makes her feel more engrossed in her imaginative play as she models what she sees &#34;mommy&#34; doing (and discourages her from trying to play with my ice maker and dishwasher since she has one of her own!)<br /><br />Overall, if you are considering this kitchen it is probably because of the contemporary look and the fact that it is made of wood and not clunky plastic.

If you have ordered this kitchen for Christmas be sure you put it together ASAP, as you are not going to want to spend a very large portion of your Christmas Eve or Christmas Day putting it together. My husband spent nearly 6 hours assembling this kitchen, with my help here and there. He said it was one of the most time consuming and elaborate things he has EVER put together (including adult furniture). Although the procedure is not difficult, it takes a very long time and in hindsight if we worked together it probably would have cut an hour or two off the process. My husband noted that he didn't know why more of the parts didn't come pre-assembled. For example, knobs, door handles, and grills could have come attached already. You literally have to put every single thing together. It is an awful lot of work for a kids toy. If your little boy or girl is the kind of kid who plays with something for a few days and is over it, then this kitchen is NOT worth the effort.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFIA4ZQEA7ED7HMVQ4TKSDWEJWYA,1450696774000,3,True

I spent a little less than 2 hours putting together while watching a movie. The instructions are similar to ikea in that there are no words. I felt that they were very easy to follow. I am a women and did this using a Phillips screw driver as well and a dewalt electric drill (I have a hard time making things tight). The drill was not too much for the wood. I do however feel u should have a flathead on standby. This kitchen set is very sturdy. I did find the only place I seemed to have difficulty was putting the counter top on. I did have to take it off and have my husband help me hold it in place befor spurting it back on, but no harm done.

2304,5.0,4 hours 10 minutes to put together by skilled carpenter,"I gave this kitchen a 5 star review because now that it's built, it looks adorable and my 2 year old and 7 year old, absolutely love it. I will caution that a friend of our family put it together, and he noticed some pieces had been drilled upside down, and at least 3 major wood pieces did not fit. Given his skill level in carpentry, however (he builds custom wood projects for others, as a side business), he was easily able to disassemble the factory components, line things up correctly and he had to drill some new holes. He also noted that 2 of the external brown colored screws were not included, so, he used silver ones. It looks alright to us. He also cautioned that the top piece that goes along the top of the microwave, is not flush with the back of the unit, another factory error that required his ingenuity to get past. So if this is a Christmas surprise, do not wait until Christmas Eve to build it!! It took him<br />4 hours and 10 minutes (including about 15 minutes of that timeframe to eat dinner with our family - it was the least we could do, right?!) ... Even if you think you're pretty skilled, I'm certain you'll find this kitchen a challenge to assemble. The only difference I noticed from the picture, is the phone. We received a wooden one that appears &#34;digital&#34; like a cell phone. It doesn't have large numbers like the one shown. That was a little disappointing, because my 2 year old is learning to recognize written numbers. Oh well. So glad this was on sale, I wouldn't pay over $112 for this kitchen. Some wood pieces were scratched too, but a brown sharpie marker fixed it. Honestly, the little dings, and bumps along the way trying to assemble it don't really matter once it's together. It still looks really cute and my girls love it, so 5 stars it is. I'm also ok with it in our family room because it's not an eye sore like some of the other toy kitchens out there. It's also compact and doesn't take up too much space, but still has an oven large enough for them to put toy cookie trays, etc., inside, for more realistic dramatic play. ... We bought the matching laundry unit with a washer/dryer, but that will have to be assembled at a later date. I peeked in the box though and it matches this kitchen perfectly!

My husband and I are not stupid, I have a doctorate, and he is an engineer... And it took the two if us about 4 hours to put this together.  And maybe 1 extra hour dedicated to swearing at it.  It was tedious, the directions were pictures and it required us to assemble everything (as in installing the door catches, adding all of the knobs on the stove, the door handles.<br />Nothing is pre assembled.<br /><br />On the other hand, this kitchen is solid.  It is very high quality, and if not such a pain to assemble would be worth much more than it sells for.  I feel like I could jump on it and it would probably be fine.  It is very handsome and well designed.<br />We have 3 small and squirrelly children that take great delight in destroying things, and I doubt that they can take this thing out.  I never say never, but this is a pretty formidable kitchen.<br /><br />The finishing is nice; when we assembled it we assembled it partially on tile flooring and it definitely got kicked around (and cursed at!) but you'd never know it.  Our toddler has hit it with wild abandon and a rather sturdy set of wooden pots.  Still looking excellent several months later!<br /><br />I also appreciate that they even considered air holes in the oven/dishwasher compartments.

2327,5.0,Love this kitchen set,"Love this kitchen set!  Its really high quality, and very solidly built.  And for the 10,000 screws and things needed to put this together, everything lined up perfectly.  One reviewer commented that this kitchen is constructed better than a lot of furniture, and having assembled tons of furniture, grills, etc in the past, I would have to agree with that statement.  I put this together myself over the span of two evenings.  It took 2 -3 hours to do with nothing more than a Philips head screwdriver and the allen wrench that came with the hardware.  My one bit of advice would be this: the wood panel between the oven and the dishwasher has plastic strips on both sides of it.  This is where the oven and dishwasher racks slide in and out.  There is only one screw to attach the two plastic strips to the wood.  In other words, you screw through a piece of plastic, a piece of wood, and then another piece of plastic with one Philips head screw.  I completely stripped the head of the screw trying to get it in.  Drill through both pieces of plastic before putting the screws in so that they go in a little easier.  I ended up having to hunt through my tool box to find a replacement screw; it was a tiny bit longer than the one that came with the kitchen and now the oven rack is hard to get in and out because it rubs against the screw.  Overall, this was a small issue.  I highly recommend this purchase.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFULVVMMGZ432ZYE6SPVE7KPE3TQ,1423337784000,0,True

The quality of the product is truly second to none and the packaging was neatly organized and user friendly.  It took 4 hours to assemble, but not beause it was a difficult assembly.  I'm meticulous and really took my time to be sure I did it properly.  The instructions were incredibly well explained, every single piece was carefully numbered and the hardware blister pack was neatly organized and labeled.  I was very impressed with the quality of the hardware too.  Oftentimes products like these will provide cheap hardware, such as soft screws that strip the moment you tighten them.  Not this hardware.  Not at all.  My 2 year old daughter received this as her birthday gift and she absolutely loves it!  She proudly talks about &#34;her kitchen&#34; and has played with it non stop since she received it.  I highly recommend this kitchen to anyone who, like me, is particular about the look of a gigantic toy that will be a centerpiece of your living space.

2384,3.0,Good product but mine was damaged.,"The kitchen itself is great. Good quality and straight forward to assemble. Took hubby about 1.5 hours to do. Need an electric screwdriver and alan key.  The pieces are very well labelled. My issue is with the seller AMAZON.  I ordered a &#34;used&#34; product that was rated as Very Good Condition. But when I received the product, 2 of the pieces were significantly damaged--and 1 of the pieces is very visibly damaged on the outside of the unit.  So I don't feel that AMAZON was accurate in describing the condition of the product.  But this is better than most of the plastic kitchens.  I'd say it would be perfect for age 16months and older.  Only downside is that it has no food/pots and pans/utensils.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFHBNUS2ZFUNIW5GFCUBIVD5QBMQ,1445744613000,1,True

I watched the assembly process and observed a lot of laughter and bonding happening. I asked them for their opinion on the quality of the directions. They all said the directions were pretty good and that quality of the product was excellent. I am very satisfied. Thank you!,[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHYCCCHWANRTD2JQ45IXCK5VKMPQ,1575749179710,0,True

2461,4.0,Excellent but difficult to build,"I agree with many of the other reviewers - this is an excellent play kitchen. It's sturdy, high quality, and very nice to look at. I was just amazed at how complicated it was to put together! My father-in-law assisted me - and he's a very handy guy - and it took us about 4 and a half hours. We were stuck at the very first step in the instructions for 30-40 minutes, just staring confusedly at the diagram. There are 35 steps, but each step really contains 4-10 sub-steps. They really should have broken things up a bit more to reduce confusion. Though some other posters have boasted about putting it together quickly and/or by themselves, I would recommend having a helper. Some of the steps are a little tricky for a not-particularly-handy dad like me.<br /><br />Be aware that it doesn't come with anything besides the kitchen itself. That's not a negative - just be aware. You'll need to purchase play food, pots/pans, etc. separately. That said, my 2 and a half year old is much more interested in the cordless phone part of it rather than the kitchen itself, at least right now.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a good non-plastic play kitchen with a dark wood/stainless steel look, this is the one. Just be prepared to spend a good amount of time putting it together. But when you're done, sit back with pride and hope that your child will appreciate the effort you put, at least implicitly by actually playing with it!",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGATBPG7VNFG36JN3RGNRHUN3UCA,1388523889000,0,False

2469,4.0,Very Nice Kitchen and It Was As Expected.,"Bought this as a gift from Santa for my daughter.  Started assembly yesterday.  Haven't completed it yet as my 4 year old daughter can't seem to stay out of the house long enough.  I may change some things with the review once it is completed.<br />PROS; 1: Firstly, I inventoried all the items and everything was there.I was definitely worried about missing parts as described in other reviews.  Luckily, mine came complete.  2: Firm construction, thought I was putting together an actually piece of furniture with the type of hardware that comes with the kitchen. 3: Aesthetic, I showed my wife what it looked like this far.  We are very pleased with how it looks.<br />CONS; 1: So far, the instructions for assembly have been easy to follow with the exception of one task that was a &#34;light bulb&#34; moment.  I'll update with pictures when the project is completed. This portion should be two separate steps.  2:  I would like to see the colored (brown/stainless) hardware separated as during assembly, questioning which to use was frustrating.  I'll explain more with pictures.  3: If you want to complete the assembly in one sitting, ensure you do set aside 2.5 hours. Several small parts to assemble like the clasps that hold each door closed, the handles, knobs, etc. 4:  Do not over tighten screws, especially the small ones. 5:  If the &#34;light bulb&#34; moment mentioned above would have been two steps, I would have avoided breaking a screw into the bottom of the cylindrical part, which in the main picture appears to be chrome on the right side.  5: Now that I have looked again, the faucet appears chrome in the picture.  Nothing has that appearance.  It is all flat grey with a &#34;silver&#34; shine.<br />RECOMMENDATION;  I would recommend this kitchen to a friend and family member.  I do feel the quality is very good and I believe this kitchen will last for quite some time even with my daughter's waking path of destruction.  I'd give 5 stars if they made changes as I mentioned above and make the &#34;chrome&#34; looking items appear how they come.<br />EDIT: Before and after step 22, assembly was easy.  Step 22 should be separated into different steps as you have to 'undo' if you placed board 21 onto the assembly first as I did.  In order to screw the 'pole' #20 onto the 'board' #21, you have to have access to the recessed portion on the bottom as the head of the screw sits there.  Putting together the 'pole' and faucet should come first.  Other than that and the appearance of chrome, I like it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DYB4XgHlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DYB4XgHlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71DYB4XgHlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C2JiCeZfL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C2JiCeZfL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81C2JiCeZfL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AF3OHCL3HW32GWXOODAVKY2QEN7A,1513691421326,1,True

Some tips for assembly are: Step 22, there are four &#34;Q&#34; screws to install in this step, even though the diagram shows two. For the expresso-colored kitchen, both &#34;A&#34; and &#34;C&#34; screws come in two colors: silver and brown, which is a great touch. Choose the color that best matches the furniture color in the parts that are visible. For example, for step 15 use the brown-colored &#34;C&#34; screws; for Step 16, use the silver-colored &#34;A&#34; screws since this area is not visible; for step 22 use the silver colored &#34;C&#34; screw, ...

The height of this kitchen is perfect for my 3 yr old daughter as she is quite tall.<br /><br />The only thing missing with this kitchen is the sound feature. It will be great if the manufacturer add sound at least to sink and the dishwasher opening to be upside down not side wise. That's the only reason to pull up 1 star.<br />No complains otherwise. Very much satisfied and will definitely recommend this product .<br /><br />My review for this product is completely true and unbiased as I too purchase anything only after reading the reviews of the product and that helps me to make my selection much easier.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71br54H86yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71br54H86yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71br54H86yL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGSSZAFJPD6B4XAYN3LXJSHDTRSQ,1455833049000,0,False

2545,5.0,"Great looking, quality toy kitchen","We purchased this kitchen for Christmas this year and I can't say enough good things about it.  First off it is adorable and of good quality.  It is one of the best looking toy kitchens I have ever seen (maybe second to buying all the expensive Pottery Barn sets) which I considered.  However it is a great value compared to that as really almost as attractive.  Love that it has four burners, a dishwasher and microwave, chalk board, phone and removable cutting board in the dishwasher.  The dials/knobs on the stove make clicking noises when they are turned.  Also-the kitchen provides more than ample storage space for all of her toy foods and small appliance and dishware etc. plus it still has room to spare for other toy storage as well.  It is a good height for her to play with and looks like it will still be appropriately sized for a few more years.  She seems to really love her kitchen and plays quietly with it all the time which is great!<br />We also go the Melissa a Doug cookie set and it fits in the oven as well.  Honestly I can't say enough great things about this product-- don't hesitate to purchase this item.  Finally- in our experience assembling this it was time consuming (about 2 hours) however it was easy.  The directions were good there were just a lot of pieces.  I was slightly worried based on other reviewers comments that we would find out it was missing parts or damaged as we put it together on Christmas Eve but that was not the case at all.  The kitchen appears of great quality and all pieces were accounted for.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AH5EBRD63TB6LGURJH7G4EQYTBIA,1357433030000,0,False

2564,5.0,Very good product,"We purchased this kitchen for our almost-three-year-old daughter for Christmas, and it was an instant hit. While I can't speak to the durability, since we just bought it, it seems very solid and like it will withstand the wear and tear that comes with toddlers. The actual product is true to the picture; if possible, it looks even nicer in person (my husband and I joked that it's not fair our toddler has a nicer kitchen than we do). If you have a small living space, like we do, with no designated play room, this is a great choice because it fits with most decors; it's not cutesy like other toy kitchens.<br /><br />My daughter loves turning the knobs on the stove and putting things in the oven, dishwasher, sink, fridge and microwave. The phone is a great source of entertainment for her as she's ""cooking,"" and it's great to see her imagination soar as she comes up with different ""recipes"". She played with it for a good two hours the first day she got it and has been playing with it regularly ever since.<br /><br />My only slight complaints are as follows:<br /><br />--It is very time-consuming to put together. My husband started at 10:30 pm and didn't finish it until after 12:30 am (closer to 1 am). And this man is an engineer who is very good at putting things together, so it's not like it was user error. So plan on plenty of time to set this up; don't think you can get up an hour before they do on Christmas morning and have it put together.<br />--Also, there were some slight nicks in the wood, which was disappointing, but not nearly enough to affect the look of the product or our satisfaction with it. Still, it's annoying that we noticed some nicks there as we took it out of the box (so we know it wasn't our daughter).<br />--It does show fingerprints easily, which probably wouldn't be too much of an issue for older children, but for toddlers who often have stuff on their hands (despite my best intentions!), the kitchen definitely shows that. But, it just means I'll have to wipe it down more frequently.<br /><br />All in all, a great buy that will be used by my daughter (and any other future children) for years to come.<br /><br />One note, though; I got it on Walmart.com for $60 less than the price advertised on Amazon on the day I wrote this review, so that is something to consider, as well.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFW6NDRACQVZL6XIQ72TT2OYV2NA,1357089746000,0,False

I have never put anything this large together and I did it in 3-4 hours, it wasn't difficult, there is just a lot to put together. I made a big open some space and laid all the pieces out. I did get frustrated because some of the screws are colored brown so that they match the outside and others are silver, however in the packaging they do not divide them up or explain in the instructions.<br />Also, all the parts that are not wood are plastic, and I am a little worried they will easily brake. If you don't mind putting it together and some plastic, this is perfect! My son loves it, but I am a bit picky, and personally I would have saved up an extra $100 to get an all wooden kitchen that may be a little smaller but would definitely last for generations to come. P.s. He also received the Melissa and Doug pots and pans set, and they are a little too wide for the microwave so they door cannot shut if they are in there.

First, organize all pieces in the numerical order even the small pieces. Keep the small pieces in their original bags cause the number is on the bag! Tips to open the screws, cut the plastic with a cutter; do not rip it from the back - so you know the number of each screws! Second, have one person hand out the right pieces and screws to the other person putting it together. It took me and my dad 2 hours. There are lots of screws but all worth it cause it seems to be great quality! The instruction could have been better written and drawn at some of the steps; but overall it's okay and use your common sense.

I didn't feel that way while we were putting it together though. We started putting it together at 8pm and finished a little after midnight.

Some of those steps involved more steps.<br /><br />Now that it is finished, my son plays with it constantly. It is pretty enough that I can keep it in my kitchen so that he and I can cook at the same time. He can't quite reach the microwave yet, and the different doors are a little bit difficult for him to pull open, but we just leave them open, and it isn't an issue.<br /><br />Overall, we are glad we made this purchase.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AEJG6NEOYQ76VRQ4HTTSGT523VVQ,1455742905000,2,True

2657,5.0,Great little kitchen,"We bought this kitchen for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. It comes in a long, flat box. Pretty heavy, not the easiest for one person to move around. One corner of the box was pretty well crushed, but the styrofoam packing inside kept all the pieces unbroken.<br />Assembly wasn't bad, but you should grab a cordless drill and set aside a couple hours. The instructions are straightforward and all the panels and hardware are numbered, which makes it much easier. I put it together myself, but there were a few steps where another set of hands really would've helped. Most of the hardware was very similar to what you'd find with other furniture you assemble yourself, e.g. the stuff from a certain big Swedish store. If that gives you problems, maybe this kitchen isn't for you.<br />The only minor issue was that some of the hardware was labeled the same and was essentially identical except for being two different colors - some brown and some stainless steel (see photo). It was unclear in the instructions where each color was meant to go, and I didn't have the patience to try to figure it out myself. Otherwise, this is a great little kitchen.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61m00W6ZmjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61m00W6ZmjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61m00W6ZmjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RC4+Ru10L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RC4+Ru10L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RC4+Ru10L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AG622HKBEZBULUFOMD4FOTE5Z5EQ,1517020698718,1,True

2679,5.0,Great kitchen!!! - plus a couple tips for assembly!,"I did not realize when I purchased this kitchen it was notably one of the hardest ones to assemble. So thankfully after reading some reviews I knew what my husband and I were getting into. Once assembled it is so dang sturdy and will last forever!<br /><br />Tips:<br />- Put this kitchen together with ANOTHER PERSON. My husband was the main assembly person but it would have taken 2x as long if I wasn’t there to help. We laid everything out and I had the instructions and all the screws + extra parts. So as he was working on the current step I was setting out the things needed for the next step and could just hand it over and tell him what needed done.<br />- Split up the assembly into 2 parts. For 2 nights we put the kids in bed, put on The Office, and got to work.<br />- Try to be nice to the other person. Honestly I thought we would fight a bunch during this project, but since we each had a role and we knew we were making this for our kids we didn’t have a single argument. (There was a moment I was tired and MAYBE got a little sassy but 🤷🏼‍♀️)<br />- A milkshake run by one of you while the other sets out the pieces is a really good idea!<br /><br />Anyways I hope this review helps someone! In total it took us 3 1/2 hrs to assemble. That is about 8 episodes on The office. You can do it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815bt-hQN2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815bt-hQN2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815bt-hQN2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFT76GQRN72J4ZOVUQ6OKPUM4QAQ,1608842550368,0,True

Just follow the directions. Take all the pieces out of the box and take the time to organize everything by their numbers and DON’T do it alone.

2730,2.0,Stay away unless you think IKEA furniture is fun,"The product looks great.  It's also nice that it has not flashing lights, beeping sounds, etc., so kids are forced to use their own imagination.<br /><br />BUT, it takes HOURS to put it together.  The directions are clear, but contain 32 steps, and some of the steps combine several sub-steps.  There must be at least 20 parts and 70 screws and bolts etc. in the package.  You will spend hours assembling it.  Moreover, not all holes will lineup properly, especially in the latter stages when many pieces must fit together.  Have you ever tried to get a screw into a bolt on an angle?  Doesn't work so great.<br /><br />I am not a great handyman, but I've assembled plenty of IKEA furniture, including our son's crib and changing table.

The directions could have been a little easier to read and I wish they would have mentioned when to use the brown painted screws vs the silver screws.  (Note: place brown screws on all outer pieces and the one white painted screw is for the telephone key pad.) We had to guess when to use the painted screws and on our last two steps realized we had guessed wrong with a couple of them.  But it wasn't too difficult to unscrew and re-screw them so all the painted ones were on the outside. It does look nicer to have all the painted screws in the correct places. (Note: brown painted screws should go on all the exposed outside pieces and the one white painted screw is for the telephone key pad.  Some of the painted screws will be used for the interior pieces.) It has been worth all the effort of putting this kitchen together because our daughter loves it and has played with it nonstop for the 2 days she has had it.  We knew she would like it because she plays with the play kitchen in our church nursery every Sunday.  The design is very nice and great for our very tall 2 yr old.

2787,5.0,Great product.  4-6hrs assembly.,"My daughter loved it when we got it at 2years old.  She still loves it at 4 years old.  It is very sturdy and well made.  Very realistic.  My daughter absolutely loves this toy!<br /><br />The downside is the assembly.  I was not smart, and assembled it on Christmas Eve while everyone was asleep.  Took about 5 hours.  I was hard headed and didn’t use a drill for the first half and that definitely cost me some time.  Needless to say I didn’t get much sleep and it made for a pretty cranky Christmas Day.  Please do yourself a favor and assemble early!! Give yourself 4-6hrs set aside to work on it.  A few others suggested breaking it up into two days and that’s probably a good idea. Working with two people is also a good idea!<br /><br />Great product!  Assembly is a beating!  But the joy and excitement of my daughter’s face on Christmas morning and this past two years made it worth it!",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGO7TG76WE6MYVAQVS2X7XU7KOYA,1545754794522,0,True

2793,5.0,Best toy kitchen for my needs,"I spent a lot of time looking around for a kitchen to buy for my 3 year old daughter.  I also have a 9 month old son who will eventually play with this as well, so there were a few things that were extremely important to me in finding the right kitchen:<br /><br />1.  Size.  Something substantial enough that they wouldn't grow out of too quickly.  Height as well as ability for multiple kids to play was critical.  Also needed enough space to actually ""play"".  A lot of the kitchens I saw were small with some burners and a sink but no flat area to ""cut"" vegetables or place items.<br /><br />2.  Storage.  With all of the stuff that comes along with a toy kitchen, it was critical to find something with ample storage.  Many kitchens had a lot of little drawers and spaces, but nothing that could even fit the Melissa & Doug cookie set (I read in another review that the toy fit easily in the oven)<br /><br />3.  Gender neutral.  Not a deal breaker, but would be nice to have something my son could play with that wasn't pink.<br /><br />4.  Price.  Again, not a deal breaker, but who wants to overspend?<br /><br />Finally, after comparing and looking at the KidKraft Big Kitchen (too pink), KidKraft Vintage Kitchen (way too small), Pottery Barn kitchen (too expensive and too many pieces), KidKraft Grand Gourmet Corner Kitchen (too many small drawers) &Melissa & Doug Classic Kitchen (not bad, was a close second to my purchase, but my husband didn't like the colors) among a few others, we finally chose this one.<br /><br />First, the assembly.  As noted by other reviewers, it's not hard to put together, but is time consuming and I would recommend two adults.  Many of the steps could be completed simultaneously if you had 2 screwdrivers and 2 people.  Even so, it took us over 2 hours to finish it.  The parts mostly aligned with one or two tight squeezes.  All of the parts arrived undamaged, although there is a small plastic piece that goes under the knobs that enables the knob to make a clicking noise when you turn it... two of mine broke while installing.  I will be calling them for replacement parts.  I understand their customer service is great. Make sure not to throw away the instructions for calling customer service that is in the box - it includes a batch number that you will need.<br /><br />The completed product looks beautiful.  It is the small details that makes this so great.  The chalkboard on the fridge, the towel holder off of the side and the phone.  My daughter had a play date the next day with 3 of her preschool friends all banging the kitchen about and it seemed to hold up just fine.  Only time will tell how well the product holds up over the long term, but so far I've been happy with the product.  The price point was an added bonus!",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AGZ4SPROCNLHB5FOZ5XOKSZPG56A,1346355572000,127,True

It looks really nice. We have this in our living room and the difference between this one and our old plastic one is like night and day. 4. No cheap stickers that can be peeled off. The details are painted on so you don't have to worry about your kids peeling them off when you're not looking. 5. It doesn't make loud noises.

2832,5.0,"Durable, Sturdy, Well-Designed","We bought this for our 2 year old daughter.<br /><br />Assembly does take some time (2.5 hours for me) but the instructions are straight-forward.  Each piece is identified with a removable sticker and the screws/washers/fasteners are neatly organized and are identified in a packet.  The set comes with a small wrench and Allen wrench, but you will need a screwdriver and a Phillips screwdriver.  I recommend a power tool to speed up assembly.  The alignment for the board pieces was good, much better than some Ikea furniture pieces I have assembled in the past.<br /><br />The packet comes with a few spare parts but, in my case, they were not enough.  Toward the end of assembly, I noticed two screws were missing.  Having read some of the other customer reviews about missing/defective parts, it was disappointing but not a surprise given my tempered expectations.  I used one of the spare screws that came with the packet and called the KidKraft customer service line to request the other.  A live representative answered the call (a real person!).  Without issue, and without any scrutiny, she said she would expedite a replacement packet and it arrived in a couple days.  In this respect, the negative is that some pieces were missing and the plus is customer service took care of it quickly.<br /><br />The kitchen is stable enough that it sits on our carpet without wobble.  It's heavy enough that I don't have a high concern that it can be knocked over during use, but it's light enough that my wife or I can move/drag it to a different location without much difficulty.<br /><br />The latches are tight so our daughter needs help opening the doors.  I figure that that as she gets stronger and as the latches get more use, they will loosen and the doors will be easier to open.<br /><br />She can't reach the top shelf, ""microwave,"" or ""freezer"" yet but she'll grow into it.  Our daughter's three year old and four year old cousins and friends can reach them easily.<br /><br />She's filled the cupboards with toy foods and uses wooden Melissa and Doug pots and pans.  The M&D pots/pans aren't fully compatible in that you can't hang them on the knobs on the kitchen, but they look scaled to the stove top.  There is plenty of storage space but very little counter top (a rounded area to the right of the sink, that's it).<br /><br />The knobs for the stove and faucet click and turn but there are no push-button sounds or automated elements (as advertised).

Takes about 3 hours to put together with power screw driver and a phillips and hex tip.  I am pretty handy and enjoy putting things together.  Follow the instructions, don't try to set any assembly records and you shouldn't have any trouble. There are a couple of ambiguous directions, look at the way the door hinges work and you should be able to figure it out.  There are a lot of silver and brown screws that are exactly the same and will interchange, but follow the directions on which to use.  I think they wanted the brown ones used when the brown wood is showing, but they will interchange anyway.

It's a step above the plastic play kitchens and comes in a gender neutral color, which is great for my son and daughter.  I'd give this product 5 stars if it weren't for the smashed knob, but Kidcraft resolved the issue quickly, so kudos to them.

Going for the replacement option would be even worse cos it would require yet another 2.5 hours to set up the replacement when it arrives.<br /><br />Had we known, we probably would have considered a realistic plastic kitchen option which would be more sturdy.

We are trying not to hate him.  My mom and I took 4 hours exactly to get it done.  Once we got started and got past the first few things it went really smooth.  The one the one thing I would suggest is that you pay attention to which screws will show once the kitchen is assembled.  Some are brown to be used on the outside and some are silver to be used on the inside.  The quality of the finished product is comparable with the much more expensive kitchen we found at Pottery Barn Kids.  The end result was pure toddler joy.  This kitchen will be enjoyed for a long, long time.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AEURVVGQENTTGCV2LAF3YSNROHHQ,1482597197000,0,True

We saw it in person at a friend's house and immediately ordered it. The box came slightly banged up, but we weren't surprised because of it's size/weight. On a whim, we decided to start putting it together a week before Christmas and THANK GOODNESS WE DID! When we first opened the box we found the directions were missing. We were able to find them online, which was a bit of a hassle, but a relief! When we started trying to put them together, things got really interesting. We found that the box was missing not one part, not two parts, but FIVE essential parts including the refrigerator door and the pole that keeps the whole kitchen upright.<br /><br />I panicked because Christmas is only a week away and this is the only gift we were giving our daughter. Luckily, my husband was able to call the company and place an order online for free replacement parts. We just got a confirmation today that they overnighted them and they (should) arrive by Christmas. We were pleased with that aspect of the customer service experience, although I question how five essential parts could be missing from a fairly standard product.<br /><br />Awesome kitchen, but beware: open and begin putting together well ahead of when you need it!<br /><br />Update: Out of the 5 parts we ordered, they only sent 4 and Christmas is tomorrow.

Moral:  yes, your kids will probably love this thing, but you open yourself up to the risk of receiving broken stuff and then having to wait a long time and jump through many hoops to resolve it.<br /><br />To Whom It May Concern,<br /><br />I ordered one of your kitchen sets from Amazon.com for my son's birthday.  Much to my disappointment, one of the essential pieces arrived completely broken and will not allow me to put this set together for his special day.<br /><br />Honestly, it's completely ridiculous that you put the onus on your customer to photograph and upload an image of a broken part and proof of purchase and furthermore that your customer service number does not take calls on weekends or after hours.  Two parents with full time jobs should not have to deal with garbage like this.  You think customers are trying to steal single random parts from you?  The notion is absurd.  It should be a simple phone call and a ""yes sir or yes m'am we'll have that part overnighted to you right away"".<br /><br />I'm extremely busy and now won't have time to put this together for him until at least a week from now.  This gigantic box will not also be taking up space in our only common area until then too.  I would gladly return it if it weren't so cumbersome and impossible to repack.<br /><br />If you cannot figure out how to package your products properly so that the shipping services don't break them before they arrive, you should not be selling them and creating these sad situations for families wherein a child is expecting an amazing present and then they can't even experience it at the appropriate time due to your negligence.  And to add insult to injury make parents jump through additional hoops just to get a replacement part.<br /><br />But instead I proceeded to go ahead and jumped through your hoops, wasting time on my son's birthday.  And you have the audacity to just make it ""standard shipping""?  (note -- an automated reply email stated that it new takes up to 4 weeks for replacement parts).<br /><br />I doubt I will be able to recommend your product to anyone based on this sub-par customer service experience and a big let down on my child's birthday.<br /><br />To reiterate, if you can't pack or manufacture a piece of cheap particle board properly without it breaking, you should not be selling anything.<br /><br />Thanks for screwing up what's supposed to be a 100% happy day.<br /><br />Regretfully yours.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hc+7e4UbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hc+7e4UbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Hc+7e4UbL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AE2ZXR7DEOUVDKWQG2GVUY5PBP5A,1594496375949,6,True

It is a Christmas present for our year and a half old daughter, so I can't say anything yet about how it will hold up. Being as heavy as it is—I don't see quality being an issue. I'm definitely impressed with the appearance compared to smaller plastic kitchens that are almost as expensive. Also, instead of having stickers, it is hand-painted. It's definitely big enough for more than one child to play at the same time.

3102,4.0,"Beautiful kitchen, terrible assembly.","We love the end result of this kitchen, but getting there was the biggest pain in the ass. We had several damaged and scratched pieces, but because we were painting everything, we weren’t too worried. However, had we not been painting the pieces, I would have been furious.<br /><br />The directions are some of the worst directions I have ever followed. The pictures are not descriptive in which way pieces need to go. Some screws are silver and some are bronze. The directions never tell you which one to use so you have to make the decision on your own. Use the silver ones where you won’t see, and the bronze on the outside.<br /><br />A LOT of our holes didn’t match up. We were having to force them in to get them to line up. The very top piece of the microwave does not match up to the rest and it looks ridiculous. We might try just shaving off the extra inch of overhang. Idk.<br /><br />My takeaways: if you plan on painting the kitchen, it’s a good one to have. You can cover up the damage and you won’t see it. If you need a kitchen put together quickly and easily, find a different one. It’s beautiful once it’s together but my husband and I were ready to smash the whole thing before we were even halfway done.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wrHtErVkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wrHtErVkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71wrHtErVkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFCXKDFTY4JK65CI7FHPS7AZJMCA,1542460171766,0,True

3141,5.0,Best Christmas gift ever!,"LOVE this kitchen! Bought for 6 yr old and it was her fav Christmas gift. My child is a VERY tall 6 yr old and I purchased this product because this kitchen is taller than any other I have seen. Her older cousins have also enjoyed playing with it (boys and girls as old as 10 yrs).<br />  I read reviews and they are right on... This will take 2 to 3 hours to put together and you will need 2 people. The directions are amazing. There are only black and white diagrams, but they are constructed in a way that no matter what language you speak, you can follow along. I suggest you look at the screw tips, some are silver and some are brown (to match the parts).<br />The final product looks like a beautiful piece of furniture, which was also important to me because we are keeping this in our family room. There is plenty of storage for her to keep her pots, pans, and food (sold separately) out of sight when not in use. A few adults and children have seen it and asked, &#34;Can she really cook in that thing?&#34;. They are really thinking this is like the little ovens kids can bake in... The only negative is the phone, as one reviewer stated; it is VERY cheap looking, compared to the rest of the unit. Almost as if the person who designed the phone worked on a different project.<br />  I would order other products from KidKraft without hesitation.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ExEHsZwSL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ExEHsZwSL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ExEHsZwSL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AHERA27YXN3NIX65R24NXMHRDAIA,1451510159000,5,True

3186,3.0,Design has changed and what is advertised is not what you’ll get,"While it is a cute kitchen, I was disappointed that the pictures advertised is not what is being shipped. There’s supposed to be a backsplash with hooks to hang utensils and that was not in the design I was sent. That was one of the features I was specifically looking for when selecting a play kitchen. There should have been a sliding shelf in both the oven and dishwasher and there was only one in the oven. The chalkboard is a raised one in the advertisements and what I got was a painted on chalkboard. The faucet also looks much cheaper than advertised. I’m most disappointed by the missing backsplash with hooks as my son loves hanging things and as I said, it was a feature I was looking for when selecting a kitchen to buy. A lot of the wood pieces were damaged and scratched, but can be covered up with a wood pen. The top shelf didn’t fit right and sticks out a lot more then the rest of the kitchen keeping it from sitting flush against the wall which is also annoying. Putting it together did take a while, but that was expected and the instructions were easy to follow for the most part. Overall, for the price of this, it was disappointing that what is being advertised it not what I was sent.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1P0ubQ+I4S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1P0ubQ+I4S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1P0ubQ+I4S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1q9EpM7eIS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1q9EpM7eIS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1q9EpM7eIS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1NHYYrAwhS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1NHYYrAwhS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1NHYYrAwhS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AF5KQI77Z7BGXNGGTXAMHOGBJHEA,1611217655521,1,True
3187,3.0,Not what we expected...,"We bought this kitchen as the ""big"" birthday present for my 3 year old. The Friday before the Saturday party we went to assemble it and realized that the manufacturer did not send us piece #1, and we could not put it together. We had to go back to the manufacturer's website and request a replacement piece, which took over a week to arrive. It was sent without charge, but it was late enough to arrive that we did not have the kitchen together in time for the birthday party and could not give it as a present, which was very disappointing. If you order this item, check to make sure you have ALL pieces the moment it arrives and before beginning assembly. And give yourself 7-10 days to get a replacement if needed before you plan to use it.<br /><br />When we finally got the piece #1, the assembly took 3 hours with two people. Just be aware that this is not an item you can assemble by yourself and it will take several hours.<br /><br />It also does not look like the item in the picture. The version we received does not have the ""back splash"" with the knobs for kitchen tools. And the towel rack is part plastic (grey) and part wood (very light colored). It does not have the same appeal as what was pictured. Overall, it was a disappointing product.",[],B00592BOAO,B00ELRFLZM,AFHFEDLCLUAG6ERXBPPZL2KAEUSQ,1608160911026,0,True

3190,5.0,Amazing kitchen! Kids love it!,"I am thrilled with this kitchen. I have a 3.5 year old daughter and 2-year-old son. This kitchen is just the right size for them to play with together and not push and fight constantly. I selected it because I have a boy and girl and did not want to go with a pink kitchen, which so many of them are. I also love this kitchen for the details. The water/ice dispenser is not just a drawing as it is on so many kitchens. You can actually put a cup in there and pretend you are getting water. It has a phone which my kids love. My daughter ""called"" her Grandma and Papa who live in another state several times on Christmas morning to talk to them about the sandwich she was making Papa and the cookies she was making Grandma. The chalkboard is real and they have had fun writing on it. There is even a removable cutting board in the cabinet underneath the sink! I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B003BAN3AU KidKraft Metal Accessories Set]] with pots, pans, a ladle and spatula because the handles are big enough to go over the knobs on the ""backsplash"" and hang there.  My children have also loved the [[ASIN:B00146K0I6 Melissa & Doug Slice and Bake Cookie Set]], the [[ASIN:B00006JZCS Melissa & Doug Wooden Sandwich-Making Set]] and the [[ASIN:B000I8UK04 Plan Toys Assorted Fruits and Vegetables]].
