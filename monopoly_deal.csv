38,5.0,I'm pretty shocked at how much we ended up liking this ...,"I'm pretty shocked at how much we ended up liking this game. It's a combination of rummy and monopoly and games have all been less than 15 minutes for us. Basically, you are trying to lay down three complete sets of properties before the other players. There are cards they can play that allow them to steal one or more of your properties, force you to pay them, etc. which makes it a little hard. A hand limit of 7 cards and a play limit of 3 cards per turn means that you can't hold on to all of your properties and then play them at once. The mechanics make it easier for someone who is way behind to catch up and win the game or vice versa.

63,5.0,"Fun, Strategic Game That You Can Play Quickly and Even Teach Young Children","This is a great game that I've played a dozen times with friends and family.<br /><br />The rules are simple - draw 2 cards a turn, play up to 3 cards. First to get 3 sets wins the game.<br /><br />When we played with 3-4 players it was a little more strategy. 2 players I would not recommend as if one player takes the lead the game is usually pretty much over.  I would say 4-6+ players makes for a lot more frenetic game where people try to keep the &#34;top&#34; player down and is probably the best mix.<br /><br />We bought two decks to play with larger groups. The cards are good quality and should last. There are some areas in the rules where there is ambiguity but for a fun game that you can play in 10-20 minutes you can't go wrong.<br /><br />We've played with young children and they catch on pretty quickly, though perhaps they don't hold their &#34;powerful&#34; cards and play them more quickly than adults would. There is enough luck and chance though that they still have the opportunity to win.<br /><br />So if you are a serious board/card gamer who doesn't like elements of luck you may not like this game. I would say this game is probably about 50/50 - some games if the other person is lucky, there is just nothing you can do, but that's ok - in 10 minutes you can play the next game.",[],B00NQQTZCO,B00NQQTZCO,AGPDUJD6ZYNQDCOA6LP24Y3TINFA,1451948121000,2,True

I played this deal card game with my brother everyday and played for at least an hour. Mind that we are both competitive, we would play for that time period. At first, the rules for the game seem complicated and seemingly playing the game may be hard. But as you play more and more, it gets pretty easy to play and know all the run down.<br />There are time where some action cards used in games are debatable and is not on the list on the rules SO YOU LOOK ONLINE FOR FURTHER RULES. I remember playing a deal breaker and my brother used a just say no card, but I used a just say no card on that just say no card. Confusing,huh? The rules says that you can use a just say card on an action card, but it doesn't specifically said on another same card. So I went to look online, and lord behold, my last just say card works and I beat him out of his game.<br />If you looking for a quick fun card game, BUY IT.

And so what did I do?? Go on amazon and order one so I can test it out before gifting it to see if it was fun. It was. I went to visit my parents (who HATE monopoly) and told them they have to try this new game out, WE HAD SO MUCH FUN.

328,5.0,Best Fun Way to Lose friends( bonus: how to damage your relationship too!),"I played this in high school and it was so fun, my third year in college I remembered about the game and went out to look for it. I went to Target,Walmart, CVS, Walgreens NONE OF THEM HAD IT! I finally went to Rite-aid as a last resort and there it was, the last one but it was $10. I bought it and played for weeks and then I thought... wait why don't I try Amazon?!? It was on amazon for $6 but gradually ( more like everyday) the price continued to drop, it kept going down a few cents every time I went back to my cart. Amazon would notify me of the price changes and I waited for a month and it went to $4.99. I bought the item and returned the one I got from Rite-aid.<br /><br />Off the bat they were more fancy, because the plastic was wrapped in a gold and black foil in plastic compared to Rite-aid which was just plastic (small difference I know but still a pro)  the colors also looked more vibrant and so much nicer. Also really fun and addicting game to kill the time with friends!<br /><br />Tips to win: try to get property from your friends by renting them when they have little $ so they have to give property<br /><br />Tips for best enjoyment: Get a blue or green set which rents the most, add houses and hotels, then wait til you have a blue/green rent which rents everybody instead of the wild color rent which targets only one. In your hand you should have the blue/green rent card, and two double rents and PLAY THEM, MAKE YOUR FRIENDS(OPPONENTS) SUFFER AND NEVER TRUST YOU EVER AGAIN.<br /><br />WARNING: Do not do the mentioned above strategy to your boyfriend/girlfriend/wife/husband unless you are ready to console them and make it up to them when you DESTROY their lives and their enjoyment of the game forever.

When your initial investment is just $6, that makes for a fantastic return on investment. After playing it that many times, we still are not tired of it. While we do not play it as often as we did in the early weeks of owning the game, we still enjoy playing.<br /><br />It would be a great game to play with kids, too.<br /><br />For us, it's a great way to spend 30-60 minutes together for a casual date night. Since each game only takes about 15 minutes, we typically play best of 3 or best of 5 together.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- easy to learn<br />- game play is fast-paced<br />- it brings everything that is great about the original Monopoly game, while cutting out a lot of the bad<br />- every game is different, since the card combinations are endless<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- there really aren't any major cons<br />- if I had to name one, it would be that once each player learns the strategy, most of one's success is the result of luck, rather than skill.

This is true sometimes, but it can be nearly eliminated by strategically playing your cards with the right amount of balance.  For example, it is helpful to not play property cards until you have money to protect it and a strategy for what you and competition are doing.

459,3.0,"Good Idea, Rules Need Improvements","This is a good alternative to Uno. It is quick to learn and play, requires a casual level of thought, and is entertaining. Where it falls down is in the rules. The board game it's based on is about finance. You invest in properties to make more money, to buy more properties, to make more money, etc. Along the way, you also use your money to pay debts (rent, mostly).<br /><br />In the card game, you never have to buy properties. Money is only used to pay debts. If you are out of money, you have to use your properties to pay your debts. This means money is used solely to defend against losing your properties, which you get by drawing them at random, or taking them from other players is forced swaps. Thus, the rules say you win by acquiring three complete sets of properties. The amount of money you have is not considered.<br /><br />So, it's a fun game. But the victory conditions make no sense, and the spend-money-to-make-money theme of the board game isn't there. I think a card game based on Monopoly is a great idea.

596,5.0,"Quickly learned, but strategic!","My gaming friends and I played this for the first time. We had so much fun playing it that this is permanently finding a place in our travel gaming box. Yes, we keep a little box full of small games in the car, right next to the jumper cables. In case of emergency gaming!<br /><br />We are not a family board game group. There are plenty of reviews here for that crowd. We are gamers. This group has played Monopoly and Catan, sure, but we are more likely to get out Runebound (second and third edition each get a turn), Descent, or one of the D&D tile games like Castle Ravenloft. That is, we play those games when we aren't playing the Dragon Age RPG from Green Ronin or D&D 5th edition or building Shadowrun characters that we never get around to actually playing. :D<br /><br />This same group responded excellently to the Monopoly Deal game. The game has enough resource management and player interactivity to keep people's interest. The fact that rent is normally collected on all players means that the game is more involving than other card games whose 'hate' cards normally target a single player. This also makes it more engaging to the other players. Since almost all of the actionable cards outside of the player's turn are located in front of them, the game is more even than, say, Munchkin, where all the 'hate' cards come at the person at level 9, leaving the second most advanced player a huge opening to take the game.<br /><br />I'd say the most intriguing part of this game is each turn offers many opportunities to build an offensive and defensive structure that operates outside of the player's turn. This means that the game feels more strategic and less chaotic that one would expect of a game that is played very quickly. But this is perhaps because it's so easy to learn since it uses some mechanics and concepts from the original game. It does not take long for someone to realize the value of certain cards or to internalize the importance of careful planning.",[],B00NQQTZCO,B00NQQTZCO,AFWYWHIWTPSI7E2PZYWUGNSQ3CLQ,1461338747000,1,True

628,5.0,GREAT - fast paced and fun!,"Monopoly Deal is a great game. My brother and I (30-somethings) played so many two-person rounds I can't even count. It's fast-paced and depending on your familiarity with the rules and strategies, a full game lasts about 20-30 min, in my opinion. What I loved in particular is how it is truly a game you can play with two people and still have the full experience and strategy. We also got our mom to play with us, and she enjoyed it, too. There is definitely strategy involved in terms of what cards to lay out, what cards to bank, what cards to hold in your hand, and timing of taking actions. The rules might sound complex when you start, but after a round or two, it's easy to pick up. Tip: We typically bank house and hotel cards since the game is so fast that we don't have as much time to lay out a full property set, add a house/hotel, and collect rent (if we had an appropriate rent card in our hands).<br /><br />My only criticism - and this is rather minor - is there are a handful of scenarios for which no set rules are included in the instructions.

Players B/C/D/E can still use the wild however they like.

No board, no pieces, no money, no large storage box.  We love it.  The only negative is trying to get a new person to play.  They are hesitant so you have to be patient and not buy them out in 5min.

Strategy-wise it's much more like card games than the Monopoly board game. Liking or disliking Monopoly is not a prerequisite, but you need a little patience to learn the game play. One of the things I like most about Monopoly Deal is that it's anyone's game until the end. You don't have players dropping out, losing, or bored for over half an hour, like with the board game.

Great for travel or just when you want a quick game with no hassel, there is little to set up or clean up here. Four rules cards are included for quick reference for all the players.<br /><br />Game Play: The object of the game is to collect 3 full property sets before anyone else does. To do this, you'll manage property cards, money cards (which allow you to build your bank - important so that you don't have to pay other players with your properties), and action cards (which allow you to collect rent, steal properties, sue other players, and more). The properties will be famliar to regular Monopoly players, but most of the other aspects of this game are new.<br /><br />We had a great time playing Monopoly Deal on a recent family vacation while waiting for the evening's activities to begin. Shuffling the cards and dealing out the first hand was the extent of the setup. Once we were done, we just put all the cards back in the box - that's all the clean-up that's required.

1069,5.0,Great Fun!  A very mean and wonderfully quick game.,"This is a great game - absolutely worth it, especially since the price often dips below $5.  Others have given their thoughts, but here is my quick summary.<br /><br />Gameplay:  Make 3 sets of properties, either by luck of the draw, or swiping them from your opponents .  It's a take-that type game, where some of the best laid plans get blown up. We have played with 2, 3 and 4 players and gameplay is about 10 to 15 minutes.  Outside of a first game, I have not seen a need to handicap for younger players (>9 yrs).<br /><br />Components - the cards are a little on the thin side, but that can be expected for the price point, and the number of cards in the deck.  The box will wear out quickly, so a cheap deck box would be a necessary accessory.<br /><br />Our thoughts:  This is the only version of Monopoly that we would play.  This game was a Christmas stocking gift for the 10-year old.  He carried it around throughout the holiday, and even taught the babysitter when we got back home.  It's learned quickly, and never played just once.  It's frustrating, hilarious, and certain to have at least one person shouting for a rematch.

If you're a money grabber, you can bankrupt people. If you like to hoard properties, you can be the baddest realitor on the block. If you like to play shrewed strategy and pit your opponents against each other, you can do that too! The 3 types of cards can all be played in different ways so everyone can play however they want in order to monopolize the game.<br /><br />I have only played with other adults, but I'm sure kids will be able to pick up on this game easily as well.  If you like to play quickly, you can. Or, if you like to get more competitive, you can stretch a game out to about half an hour. Either way, you never have to fear being trapped in a hellish 6 hour game that makes you feel like time has stopped, or worry about losing a little plastic house that you will step on later.<br /><br />A true 10/10.",[],B00NQQTZCO,B00NQQTZCO,AHSBYS2TIATGKP75SZOPVY4Y2HEA,1581915452104,0,True

Thirdly, the mechanics is MUCH more exciting and unpredictable - I'll explain. Most people like the &#34;Chance&#34; or &#34;Community Chest&#34; cards where you can get a good or bad turn of events - that element of &#34;luck&#34;?

(Don't judge us- it was a cold lazy day! Haha!) I read the reviews and read about some unfortunate deliveries, so I realize now, that we were totally fortunate to have ours delivered without a hitch! I didn't even realize how fortunate we were to have had the opportunity of buying the green version until I wanted to buy another one, and it WASN'T available! I'm definitely keeping an eye out for another of the green version, but we gifted our nephew (really, his parents) with a blue version. I can let everyone know how that one fares in comparison when it comes in and we all play it! You will definitely not be disappointed!

Someone recommended Monopoly Deal so we checked it out on Amazon and saw a ton of great reviews so we purchased it.  This game is so fun!!

One of the great things about it is that games are done in 15 min so you can play multiple games if you have time or only a couple and you're not committed to 4 hours or an entire evening.  If one kid had to leave, the rest of us could still play.  We also brought it along when we visited our out-of-town family for New Years and taught them (and it's so cheap you can buy several and give them away) and everyone loved it.

You'll be a little confused or overwhelmed a little at first but read the instructions over and over part by part, it'll come to you quicker and more clearly in no time... As it says itself, once you play then you'll understand haha.<br /><br />I recommend playing a Tutorial Round or two where everyone shows their cards and discusses eachother strategies per play they're thinking at given times which will make playing the game 10x easier and quicker to understand during Tutorial phase - You'll learn so much that way and then when you play normal from there on, everyone will never want to stop!",[],B00NQQTZCO,B00NQQTZCO,AGEHGHPD3EIQVTDNT4TOFRDP2LCA,1487597302000,1,True

This makes it nice since they actually want to play and soon find themselves wanting to play over and over.<br />There are several different action card such as “Just Say No” when a player trying to take property or make you pay a huge amount of rent. In addition, there are extra turn cards that can be used to increase your chances of winning. Also, there are cards that allow you swap properties with someone or to steal a whole set, but it can be countered with a “Just Say No”.<br />We play it two different ways – one whoever gets 3 full properties wins or whoever get a certain amount of money wins. The winner of the previous game usually chooses which we will do. Most of the time the games are used to make deals of who wins they get something or a loser owes the winner something.<br />We keep two sets at home and one in each vehicle so that if we are ever anywhere that a game would add some fun we whip it out.

The only downside is the instructions are a little hard to understand by just reading them my advice would be to play a hand open first. The more you play the easier the rules become. Also there are a few rules not included in the instructions if this happens hopefully Everton can agree what to do in those off predicaments. For us we went to google!!!

The cards all have a simple $ value assigned to them. The objective is to get three property sets to win.<br /><br />The whole family plays it -- including our children (age ten and thirteen). We play a lot of games (including strategy, deck-building, RPG, and cooperative games).  Elementary school kids should have no problem playing it.

2548,4.0,"Quick, transportable form of Monopoly","Fun card game that can take far less time than the Monopoly board game and may even require more strategy than the up-to-chance roll of the dice in the board game version. Not too difficult to learn and not many rules - the rules could be clearer about some things, but perhaps they intended you to decide yourself.<br /><br />There is one rule I change when playing. The rules state that once a person has 3 property sets, the game is over, and that person wins, making money in your bank not very crucial. So, I play that the game ends, but the person who has the most money (including value of property) wins. This typically extends the game a bit since a person needs to make sure they have the most money before obtaining 3 sets, but I would say it makes the game better.

2619,3.0,Purple Phoenix Games Review,"Yep. You read that correctly. This is a review of Monopoly Deal. Classic Monopoly gets a bad rap from almost all gamers, and I know we are all tired of saying, “No, not like Monopoly” when asked about our gaming hobby. But how does this card version of the game hold up? Is it any better than the original, or is it still destined for the “To Sell” pile?<br /><br />Monopoly Deal is a game of hand management, set collection, and take that as players are trying to collect 3 complete property sets. Setup is simple – shuffle the deck of cards and deal 5 to each player, put the remaining cards in a draw pile, and determine the starting player. On your turn, you will complete 3 steps: draw 2 cards, play up to 3 cards, and discard your hand down to 7 cards if necessary. Play then continues clockwise to the next player. There are 3 different ways in which you can play your cards. You can play money into your bank, add properties to your collection, or play action cards to the center of the table. Action cards allow you to do things like charge opponents rent or draw additional cards. The game ends once a player has completed 3 complete property sets. Be the first to do so, and you are the winner!<br /><br />I know you’re dying to get to the point – is this card game any good? I do have to admit that it has its good points. The game is easy to learn and fast to play. One of the worst parts of the board game version is that it feels like it takes an eternity to play. As a card game, the flow is faster and that makes it more engaging for all players the entire time. The rules are simple and clear, and there is no ambiguity as to how different cards work. Don’t want a property? Just don’t play it! There’s no need to send it to auction like in the board game, just discard it when you get a chance. This card game version simplifies the board game in a way that makes it enjoyable.<br /><br />The biggest downside for me regarding Monopoly Deal is that this game is based mostly on the luck of the draw. It is very difficult to create a strategy because you are at the mercy of your hand of cards. No matter how hard you try, or how adept you are at strategy games, if the deck of cards is working against you, it is very difficult to bounce back. Another part of this game that I do not like is the take that aspect. I’ve said it before, I do not enjoy direct confrontation in games. I can be pretty competitive and I begin to take things personally, which makes the game fun for nobody. This game can get pretty cutthroat, and because of the large luck element, it can feel unbalanced and unfair. Parts of it feel kind of Munchkin-y to me, and it brings down my enjoyment factor.<br /><br />For such a light and luck-based game, Monopoly Deal really has a little more to it than meets the eye. Is it better than the board game version? In my opinion, yes. I would much rather play the card game than the board game. That being said, I reserve this game more for a filler game or an introductory game for newer gamers – it’s not one that I am dying to pull out at every opportunity. Should you give it a try?

2998,5.0,"Great, Simple take on a Classic","For fans of Monopoly, let me tell you - This game is even better than Monopoly.  Why is that?  Remember how in Monopoly you circle the board waiting to earn enough money and hoping to land on just the right space?  And then someone else lands on the one piece of property you needed to make up your monopoly?  Well, those days are over.  This game features every property in Monopoly, but it also has plenty of Wild Cards for each property group so that the odds are you can build a full property set without the need for finding just the right combination.  Plus, there are many interesting &#34;dirty tricks&#34; cards that allow one to assemble monopolies through forced trades or outright theft of cards held by other players.<br />But don't worry there are plenty of such cards.  So if you get robbed in one hand, someone else is going to get it right back in the next hand.<br /><br />Rounds end when one player completes and lays down three monopolies.  I have seen many rounds end where several players are within one draw of winning.  It plays fast (15-20 minutes per round), and is easy to learn: Start with 5 cards; each turn a player first draws two new cards and can then play up to three cards.  No more than 7 cards can remain in a player's hand at the end of their turn.  The remainder must be discarded.<br /><br />Easy.  And loads of fun.",[],B00NQQTZCO,B00NQQTZCO,AG6XJYTATQLMWINGKQDDFWSOAHWA,1469593409000,1,True

It takes little minds away from iPads, PlayStations, and phones - and brings out laughter and a competitive spirit.  Stealing properties, charging rent, and waiting for that perfect move to win the game has become staple moments in our home, and we cannot be happier.<br />We played it at the airport, the hotel, and the beach due to its convenience, and we easily looked up the rules to secure a win.  The only thing to buy with this is extra tape as we already had to reinforce the little box twice from over-use.  Bought a second set just in case, or to gift to another family.

Yet we get tired of the tedious amount of time and counting and all of the unnecessary mundane things that must be done to play the full game.<br /><br />Monopoly Deal eliminates all of that.<br /><br />It plays fast, 15-30 minutes, no counting, rules are fun...and what I enjoy most is that it can be far more cutthroat and competitive.<br /><br />There is some luck involved with the cards you draw, but that adds to the strategy.<br /><br />We mostly play 2 players and it helps to make the game more competitive if you elimate some doubles/quadruples of certain action cards. For example: Pass Go, Forced Deal, Sly Deal, Deal Breaker...<br /><br />Although without doing that the game can still be much fun and swing wildy, making for exciting victories or defeats. Even if one person appears to be dominating with bank and properties. You can draw a Deal Breaker and steal a whole property and then draw a card that completes your 3rd and win just like that.<br /><br />Keep your bank full and build your properties fast.<br /><br />This is alot of fun and I don't think we'll ever go back to a full board version of Monopoly.<br /><br />We are excited to teach some friends this game and see how 4 or more players go with this.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

We have only had it for a few weeks, so it's hard to tell if the excitement will last, but given that she requested it after playing several times at her friend's, I imagine it will.  The game has some flexibility, which adds some interest (for example, the directions state that the first player to earn 3 monopolies is the winner, but you can easily play until the draw pile runs out, and then call the winner the one with the most assets...).  The game was interesting enough for me as an adult to play along with my daughter, happily enough.  There is some strategy along with luck.  It is based loosely upon the classic Monopoly ideas (to collect properties, create monopolies, collect rent, amass wealth, etc.).",[],B00NQQTZCO,B00NQQTZCO,AFG2SOB6IP2UNJOLWOK7VEYBQY2A,1470102230000,0,True

3201,5.0,New Twist on the Classic Monopoly,"I received this as a Christmas gift.<br /><br />I am so glad that they are selling this game again!<br /><br />I used to have this, and my mom and I would play it all the time. It was our 'go to' game. But then we stored it in the closet and one day it fell open and somehow all of the cards were lost. We have been looking for a the game for a while now, hoping to replace the old one and could never find it. They just now started selling it again on Amazon and I am beyond happy to have it once again.<br /><br />The game itself if very consolidated and does not take up nearly as much space as Monopoly. I would rather bring this on a trip than bring the original Monopoly.<br /><br />The two games are slightly different, though. A game of Monopoly Deal is much shorter than a game of regular Monopoly. Also, in Monopoly Deal one does not buy houses or hotels; instead you must pick up a house or hotel card.<br /><br />You start off with five cards for each player, and on their turn the player will draw two cards and play three cards. Your goal is to be the first one to get three full sets of properties on the table in front of you. When this happens you win.<br /><br />The game is good quality. The cards are not so thick that they can't be shuffled and they are not so thin that you would be concerned about bending or tearing them while playing.<br /><br />The game is simpler than the regular Monopoly, and with a bit of help children should be able to figure it out and play. I plan to teach my 8 year old cousin this game so that he can play it with me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.",[],B00NQQTZCO,B00NQQTZCO,AFRZ6I5I7PUZLVYCK3UWBPI755VQ,1451083126000,0,False

This game is one of the easiest to learn which means a lot coming from an impatient person. It's also very hard to find 2-player games, but this one works great for my boyfriend and I to play together. It is most ideal for 2-3 people, 4-5 is pushing it a bit just due to the size of the deck. I would recommend buying 2 decks if you regularly plan with a group of 5+. Each ""round"" is only 15-20 mins making for a low time commitment as well, and this game is probably 60% luck and 40% strategy.

It wasn't until I moved to Vietnam that I discovered this gem, oddly enough. I noticed foreigners playing it rather frequently, and found that a game company here had re-designed the card game to mimic the style of 1800's Hanoi or Saigon, depending on the version purchased. Not only did this game turn out to be really addictive, but whoever designed these versions put a lot of love and time into the myriad of little details that make these cards gorgeous to look at as well. I know this review is for the U.S. version, which is frankly just depressing to look at. When I went back to the States (after giving everyone in my family a set of their own Hanoi Monopoly Deal) I picked up the U.S. version and was shocked at how plain it looks. If you can put that aside, this is a great game, and is so addictive because no two matches are alike.

We bought a bunch of the game so that when random people stopped by for Christmas we would have something to give to them.<br /><br />Game play is strategic but you can never be sure you have what you think you have because someone might charge you rent or make you pay because &#34;it's their birthday!&#34; or (even better/worse) steal your properties or completed sets right from you.  However, there are cards to combat this and it is fun to watch how it all shakes out.  Last time we played, it clearly looked like one person was going to win and then by the end of the game they had nearly nothing.<br /><br />While the game itself is fantastic, the game quality is lacking.  The cards are much thinner than normal playing cards and the boxes (we got something like four of them) looked pretty shabby, even though they were well packaged.  Also, the top is closed with a sticker (which is standard), but just getting that off tore the box on all of the ones I opened.

This will definitely be a classic in our home as it has already led to many fun times and great memories.

4057,5.0,May have saved my marriage,"I actually got this game a couple years ago at a Christmas white elephant party, but felt obligated to leave a review now anyways.  The host of the party actually thought it was hilarious that I ended up with this game because the last time her and her now husband played real monopoly with me and my now wife, my wife flipped the board breaking a couple wine glasses and I left to go to the neighborhood bar with a buddy. On top of that, my wife and I were hesitant to learn a new game so this sat in the cabinet for two years (we shouldn’t have been, super easy to learn). Fast forward those two years and we are in the middle of this sh*tshow called 2020, quarantined with no one to talk to but each other. To break up the boredom we decided to give the now dust covered game a chance.  It is all we have done during the quarantine (other than drink too much).  Every night we have played several hands.  We only got into a fight once after I ruthlessly beat her two games in a row by nonstop rent, birthday, and debt collector cards thus stealing all of her property and quickly winning in dominating fashion. (She has learned to build a cash reserve since.)  Imagine how many fights we would have got in with real monopoly! Or any other card game?
