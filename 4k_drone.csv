0,5.0,Great Drone,"This drone is great, it's very similar to the maverick pro. I would say the only pitfall to this that I wouldn't recommend for beginners is that the drone is very light so in not so perfect weather conditions if you aren't used to flying a drone it can and probably will get away from you. For a beginner drone I would recommend the hs700 since its a little bigger of a drone and carries more weight but otherwise this drone is solid for somebody who has flown a drone before and would definitely recommend to others!!.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEI7ZBN2FZTCLLBWPDUFBRBSR3WQ,1606913354702,1,False

My Contixo drone would hover like it was on a tripod. The Holy Stone drifts a little. The camera quality and ability to move it remotely far exceeds the Contixo. The electronic stability built into the camera works very well. The return home function works very well and often returns to about a 10 foot circle. When operating try to keep it in sight and you won't have any issues. If you are using it around large buildings the signal gets weak quick. But it will return if the signal gets real bad.

I have flown the 720 for a couple of weeks now, and it is built well, and was pretty stable.<br />I had a couple of issues with it, though.<br />First of all, I would have a hard time unlocking the motors. I would push the ""lock/unlock""  button, and I would get the double beep constantly! I would have to try multiple times before it would unlock and start up. Annoying...<br />Today, I was bringing it for landing. I was around 50 ft up, coming pretty much straight down, when it pitch violently left, flew across a river, and ended up in a tree on a bluff! It is not retrievable.... Very annoying!!!<br />Very disappointed!<br /><br />On the plus side, the camera is really clear, and the video stabilization  worked great!!!<br /><br />Update: I contacted HS, and explained what happened.

Updated to 4 stars based on GREAT customer service.<br /><br />The video is more stable than the less expensive Holy Stone drones, but not nearly as good as a more expensive DJI.  Also the video can only be taken straight ahead and you can pan up and down, but not side to side.<br />New update:<br /><br />The manufacturer may good on their word to send a replacement drone. However, the camera on the replacement does not work. I contacted them, and they asked me to send a video, which I did.

Its been on the charger for 5+ hours and is still charging the first battery.<br /><br />I ordered a couple more batteries that come with a charger that I've seen recommended so I will see if that works better.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with it, just wish I could fly it more than every other day.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AE52QLKPL5C3EHMJDLID5LMSIWMQ,1626478888437,0,True

32,5.0,Well Built Drone!,"This looks to be a great drone for a more advanced beginner. I have experience already with drones, but nothing quite this nice. I watched many reviews online, and for the price point everyone seemed very impressed after initial flight. I'm in Michigan and it's snowing, so I can't fully test just yet. It arrived a day early (thanks Amazon!) and everything was packaged securely. The carrying case is very nice with probably the smoothest zipper on it I've seen anywhere. The case is rigid enough to keep it all safe. The drone itself is not flimsy at all. It seems very durable and well made. After watching so many videos I already knew how to start and calibrate, but it has a nicely detailed book that is once again packaged nicely inside the case. Loading the app was easy; as was the functionality of the app. I have higher ceilings in the house, so I did a very quick test flight and all controls and features were functioning as anticipated. Now I play the waiting game for a nicer day to fly outside. I recommend this drone to anyone that already has some basic drone flying skills.

I'd prefer if it went further or if you could fly the thing past the one tree on the property without it losing connection and RTH.<br /><br />Update: The thing fell out of the sky.  It was Returning To Home after I pressed the button, and it lost connection approximately 100 feet(30m) from me and just fell.  The motors shut down and it dropped like a rock.  I have maybe 3 hours on it at this point.  I did manage to get it to start up again and fly, but I have no idea why it shut down.  The battery was a fresh one, and was firmly latched in its spot, so unless something vibrated lose....i dont know what happened.<br /><br />SECOND UPDATE: Holy Stone contacted me based on this review and offered to replace the drone based on my negative experience,  I have recieved the replacement, and will send it up as soon as I get a good day to test it out.

35,5.0,Best Value in drones for super high quality at an affordable price,"I've been a long time R/C hobbyist long before remote flying models were called drones(e.g. planes & helicopters).  This is my first drone and have been wowed by the Holy Stone HS720E.  Although I have wanted a camera flying drone for years after seeing my friends DJI Phantom; however, I couldn't see spending the $800-$1500 in something that I can crash and break or lose like I have done many times with my R/C hobby is the past.  Recently, I have seen many competitors bringing the price down on these drones offering the same features of the high cost manufacturers.  I was hesitant in falling into the cheapest price trap since I was always a believer of ""you get what you pay for"" but after immense research of reading many reviews online I am SO GLAD I MADE THE PURCHASE OF THE HS720E by Holy Stone.  This thing is incredible, very high quality, does all the features that my friends $1000 drone does and comes with a really nice case, is compact, durable, easy to fly and provides amazing videos and pictures.  I have been wowed and am now a firm believe of Best Value Shopping is real!!!<br /><br />First, I must say that the case is of very high quality rubberized material and definitely provides great protection and is custom fit to have the drone, remote, battery, charger all fit in snug without movement.  The instruction booklet is well written and had me up flying and taking awesome videos as soon as my batteries were charged.  Even more important is the quality of materials, design, and build of the drone and remote.  This screams high quality and when in flight the drone is so stable even on fairly windy days.  The flight time is great too. I flown for over 20 minutes each time and each time there was still more flight time left on the battery to go longer; however, I didn't want to take any chances.  The ""return to home"" feature really works well and a couple of times I lost site of the drone but hit that button and the drone within minutes appeared right over my head.  The follow function and point of interest work really well too.<br /><br />I am an engineer by trade and quite a stickler when it comes to quality of electronics and I am really impressed with this.  Holy stone makes quality drones and really provides some hefty competition against those popular High Dollar drones you see at bestbuy.  If you are searching for a drone to buy definitely get this one.  You will be happy.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFX73MHBSNF5SZL3UPQE55IQ645Q,1609768895226,0,True

41,5.0,A great drone from a company with great customer service,"The HS720E is a great drone for everyone, This very easy to learn and fly this drone. The 4K camera takes great pictures and video the EIS is a great feature that was added. The best thing I like about the drone is the screen on the remote, so if you lose the connection with the FPV or remote and the drone is returning to home you can still track the distance and height on the remote. The only this I would have liked to see is the FPV connection go through the remote with a cord, I have had full FPV in wide out areas out to 2,200 feat.

The drone is easy to fly.<br />I ended up having an unexpected technical issue with the drone and contacted Holystone.

43,5.0,Some design issues. Video is nothing to rave about if you really know anything about real 4K video,"SEE MY UPDATE AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW -SCROLL TO THE END OF MY REVIEW<br /><br />The Holy Stone 720e is the first drone I've ever owned or flown. As other reviewers have stated, it's an easy drone to fly. It's stable, GPS works well, the return to home function almost always returns it to within a couple of feet of the launch spot. The Learning Mode should be disregarded. Instead, in the menu, set the parameters of distance and height that you want to start out with.  Unlike some other users, I found the distance before the return video feed dropped out to be only a few hundred feet. Fortunately, the controller reaches much farther and the Return to Home function will bring the drone back if you lose sight of it. Just be sure to set your Return to Home altitude high enough to clear any obstacles around or on the path.<br /><br />VIDEO<br /> Video is one area where I have some expertise. I've worked in broadcast television, produced BluRays, including 4K BlurRays and before retirement I worked for a major audio/video manufacturer.<br /><br />The 720e frequently receives high marks for video. But there are many caveats. If you expect to create professional quality video with this drone you are likely to be disappointed unless you're prepared to spend lots of time in post production trying to clean up the files. Even using DaVinci Resolve, I'm unable to get a decent, realistic color balance.<br /><br />CAMERA CONTROLS<br />Limited, with no manual adjustment of shutter speed or aperture. Rudimentary Brightness and Contrast controls provided in the Ophelia GO app are almost useless. Using the auto ISO setting results in constant changes in levels, particularly if you are shooting in high contrast situations. There is no real exposure control and White or near white elements in the scene are often overexposed or blown out. The dynamic range of the very small sensor is limited and because the files are highly compressed, there is little you can do to recover in post. Shooting in fixed ISO100 results in washed out images.<br /><br />LENS<br />The fixed, wide angle lens borders on a fisheye perspective unless aimed perfectly level. Depending on swivel up or down, horizon lines will be distorted.<br /><br />The internal processing skews the image towards the blue/magenta end of the spectrum, which can be corrected in post. Unfortunately, the lens suffers from severe chromatic aberrations with colored fringes around high contrast areas such as dark tree limbs against the sky.  The lens on my drone was decentered with acceptably sharpness in the middle and right side of the frame, but decidedly soft on the left side.<br /><br />Shooting towards the sun or a sky with bright clouds results in loss of contrast, typical of inexpensive lenses. I devised a lens hood using sticky foam tape attached on the top edge of the camera. This reduced loss of contrast dramatically, although the magenta cast in the center of the image still remains when shooting towards the sun early morning or late afternoon.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL TIPS<br />If you want to record 4K, you will need the appropriate Micro SD card inserted in the slot of the 720e. Otherwise, the return video the Ophelia app will record to your phone or pad will be 1080P.<br />Once you've mastered flying to a point of reasonable skill and confidence, you'll be thinking about a drone with a larger sensor and better optics.<br /><br />All said, it's an acceptable first machine and I'm enjoying the learning experience but at this point it's an interim drone that will be passed on to a friend or grandson. If only the video and still images were as good as my iPhone or any number of other smart phones.<br /><br />UPDATE: After approximately a dozen flights over a four month period, the micro SD card socket failed. It refuses to seat the card, rejecting the card.  Unfortunately, being one month out of warranty, Holy Stone told me the unit was not repairable but offered to sell me a new drone replacement for 15% off retail. Knowing that dealer margins are higher than 15%, I would have expected a replacement at dealer cost.<br /><br />Additionally, video reception from the drone is poor with limited range, likely due to the antenna design and location. It is a straight wire protruding horizontally from the left rear about 1/2"". In as much as it is likely vertically polarized it should be located vertically. I bent the wire down and it improved reception distance dramatically when flying away from the launch point. However on the return the signal is blocked by the battery, resulting in loss of signal.<br /><br />So now I have a drone with very limited video range and because of the failed micro SD card socket, I'm unable to record to the card.<br /><br />I have also experienced a couple of out of control crashes, one resulted in having to replace a broken motor arm.<br /><br />This is not a product I could recommend with any degree of confidence.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL UPDATE:<br /><br />Reviewing the video files recorded on my micro SD card, I found several with the corruption suffix that I noticed before the card mechanism in the drone completely failed. This indicated to me evidence of a pending failure within a week of receipt of the 720e.  I documented this and forwarded to Holy Stone.  Fiona and Becky in their customer service department reviewed the data and I now have a replacement drone on the way.  Thank you.<br /><br />Lesson learned.  If you have any indication of failures early on with any purchase, contact the suppliers customer service. Keep all your warranty and purchase information.<br /><br />FOLLOW UP. The replacement 720e arrived and functions as expected. Because of the great customer service I am pleased to recommend the unit and change my review to five stars.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFZCYHXJXPIDVXTDGMGDBQT73A4A,1625455920962,76,True

46,4.0,Awesome Customer service and great Drone,"Ok, I just had to do this review and praise Holystone for their product and most of all their customer service!!. I am in the medical field and I bought my drone last year, for travel and vacation. Of course its in the middle of the pandemic, I anticipated things to get better, but it only got worse. I did not open the drone back then and of course got more and more busy for work. I only opened the drone 3 weeks ago, to take some b4 and after videos of my roof that was gonna be worked on.<br /><br />I found that the right front arm of the Drone was damaged, right out of the box. OK, I called Amazon that said, its a manufacturer's issue and I should call Holystone, and if I got no resolution, I should call back. I called Holystone, they told me, of course its out of  the 90 day warranty, but get this? Due to my circumstance, with me being in the medical field and not getting a chance to open it until now, they will replace it, fully, at no charge to me, and I don't have to send back the broken drone. Ok, the replacement came, and guess what, the camera got stuck and only worked once. I called them again. They immediately said, we will send you yet another new drone, no cost to you, keep the other 2 drones. I was a bit upset due to the delay and my eagerness to fly the drone. Still,, the third drone came, and, as they say, 3rd times a charm. I am happy with the replacement, and now, I actually have 3 drones. I will fix both the arm on the first and the camera on the 2nd, and fly them all. These guys at Holystone are awesome.<br />The HS720E takes awesome videos and pictures, is easy to fly, and for the money spent, it is an awesome product so far.  Thanks for listening and resolving my situation HolyStone!!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFOJW4IZ2P552EQJN4HT376PNDNA,1616947887509,0,True
47,1.0,"Unstable, especially in light winds.","I would not recommend. Very unstable even after multiple successful calibrations.. I managed to get about three stable flights, other attempts were unsuccessful. The drone will hover then just take off on its own. There’s no way that I would trust this drone to fly on its own. Great camera that’s rendered useless if you can’t trust it to fly where you tell it. I found that it also lacks enough power even in the slightest wind. Absolutely could not handle 10 mph gusts. Quality is good but unfortunately I don’t think the consistency of performance is up to par. I will be returning and looking probably in a higher price range.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFF2B6RSL2LLVXCQTYNXQXKUOCYA,1609684836189,4,True
48,1.0,Loses connection and goes AWOL,"I have a number of drones with ""real"" controllers and have no issues. This one appears to use WiFi on your phone to control it (you can't fly it without attaching a phone). I flew it in my living room on Christmas with no issues. Very stable in the air. But when I took it outside it stops responding to commands at about 50' away with a clear line of sight. I have to use the return-to-home feature to get it back. Was flying in my living room last night and it went AWOL from the controller, went full throttle, and started bouncing off things... TV, wall, ceiling, and couch. Zero control. Kill switches and throttle kill didn't work. Slight damage to my ceiling. Luckily no damage to my TV. There is a Reddit group for owners of these and others are reporting the same issue. When you call the ""support"" line it is a call center that is reading from a script. On the plus side - It is a very nice size, is very stable at hover and the camera is very, very good. But if the drone is going to go AWOL and fly away, what good is it?  Most drones when they lose connection to the controller will enter a fail-safe mode and return to home automatically. This drone doesn't.  I have requested an exchange. If the process is easy to use and the new drone flies correctly I will update this review.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFP7RC3E3HS4DHS4E2EG5VGPNWFA,1609431223829,0,False

55,5.0,"Many great features, easy to control/fly","Customer service is very helpful. The only delay I have had in responses are due to time differences.  Otherwise the many team members I have talked to have been great.  I purchased the HS720E as an intro to the 4K drone filming. I have had many other drones and I wanted to give this one a try.  I have only had it short time, so I will update this review if anything changes.<br />On first impressions, the drone is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  The 720E has a small carrying case, which seems to be nicely crafted. This makes it easy to take along for almost any trip or event.  It also came with 2 batteries and a charger.<br />The initial setup is relatively easy and strait forward. It only took 15-20minutes from opening the box to flying (minus battery charge time).  After first flight, it is super quick to pull out, unfold, pair, and fly. On a full battery, I was able to fly for nearly 30minutes in slightly gusty wind.<br />In the lowest speed mode, the drone moves very slowly which seems to make a nice smooth picture.  Video quality looks great, but the controls can be a little jumpy.  Need to practice a little more with this drone to see if it’s me or the controls.  I have added a quick video as an example.  The video was taken during a slightly gusty time (2-6mph) to test GPS and EIS.<br />Pros:<br />GPS auto return<br />Single button take off and landing.<br />Slow speed flight with EIS helps make for a nice picture.<br />Follow me, point of interest, way point flight are great features and work fairly well.<br />Size - great for anywhere<br />Controller feels nice in hands, app has nice features<br />Customer service is great!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Battery charger only charges 1 battery at a time, even though both batteries can be plugged in at once.<br />Charging the batteries takes 5+ hour per battery.<br />Only has 2 speeds, slow (tripod mode) and high (which is more like a medium).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PLVpcEcbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PLVpcEcbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PLVpcEcbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GNQlX3IvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GNQlX3IvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GNQlX3IvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81HybbfqKNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81HybbfqKNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81HybbfqKNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JozFZF2gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JozFZF2gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JozFZF2gL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yEn-XIg-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yEn-XIg-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yEn-XIg-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHDTO2HAXK2ZOJ5CHDABFG7VGOCA,1609299672331,0,True

69,5.0,Great folding drone at a good price,"[[VIDEOID:e6089609489325ad7708617d78b79c81]] I have been away from drone for a few years. I'm  no die-hard at this but I recently wanted back in. After reviewing various drones with GPS capability (using your phone to help steer and navigate the drone) I found this one, the Holy Stone 720e.<br /><br />Everything others said was good about it really is. It comes with the drone, a set of replacement props and screwdriver, a 4K digitally stabilized movable camera, controller, manual and nice hard shell case.<br /><br />It's foldable arms make it really easy to transport and store away. It's got some heft to it and the flight time is really around 23 minutes per battery. Plenty of time to sail it off, play in the sky and return it.<br /><br />It maintains its altitude and position on it's own. These are features beginners love. Once linked with GPS you can sail it off and with a click of a button have it return and set down pretty much where it took off from.<br /><br />The camera is first rate with 4K resolution and swivels from forward through 90 degrees downward. Strong winds cause jitter on the recording which is complete expected. At this price there only so much they can do. In light wind and no wind, the picture quality is ""to die for"".<br /><br />You get two powerful batteries that recharge in 5 hrs at most at the same time. An instruction manual that goes over every feature and extra props and screw driver to make fixing those early crashes easy.<br /><br />To fly it, you put in a charged battery, turn it on, connect your phone directly to it's WIFI, turn on your controller, get GPS signals and launch it. It's really fairly simple. Don't want the GPS assist, turn it off and launch.<br /><br />I gave 5 stars to the drone in every category because this is an excellent casual unit, good for non-die-hards and beginners. It's controller has useful features that you need and more for variety. It manages the drone comfortably.<br /><br />I've include a still taken overhead of my house and one video I recoded to a smaller size to include in this review. This really is a fun drone.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817RJE25GgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817RJE25GgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/817RJE25GgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AF7VNTUFQYPIZS2BZ6DEWLPUIQIA,1605455310295,0,True

83,5.0,My Drone Wishes Fulfilled,"[[VIDEOID:664063e9519c0a1b2b3ec8496ca7429]] Although I was a complete drone neophyte a month ago, I've been attempting to pick it up at every possible turn. I bought a Holy Stone HS110D a month ago after scouring drone listings and scoffing at the ridiculous prices. Little did I know I was receiving an experience on-par with what those more expensive drones had to offer.<br /><br />I took it out for a spin, realized I needed to become a better pilot before sending this $100 item whirling through the air, and made the decision to pick up a toy drone for some indoor practice. After seeing what was offered and thinking about my Holy Stone experience thus far, I decided to go with the same brand again.<br /><br />I bought an HS340 and began using it every chance I could get. I bought extra batteries and, at the same time, purchased enough replacement parts for my HS110D to keep it going for the foreseeable future. I was sold on Holy Stone and my drone piloting skills were getting better day over day. I started becoming more comfortable with the HS110D, understanding more about wash and how to take off and land properly, the impact flying upwind and downwind had on speed, and how to generally keep the drone under my control.<br /><br />While I was loving the experience and becoming more comfortable with drone flying in general, it became more and more clear that I was more interested in taking photos and videos than I was in flying the drone itself. It's fun to fly, and I'm grateful for being a more capable pilot and living up to the FAA's expectations of me, but I really just want to take great aerial shots.<br /><br />I sat back down and began my research. The HS110D doesn't have GPS capability and, as I learned, since the GPS allows the drone to maintain position, it was going to be key to taking some good pictures. I also learned how important gimbles and stabilization were. When I looked at the drones offering those features, the prices started making my head spin again. Although I didn't want to cubbyhole myself into the same brand if that wasn't going to be the right fit, and wanted to keep an open mind, it soon became clear that the best choice would be to continue my journey with Holy Stone.<br /><br />I kept running across their name in independent lists of the best drones under $500 for, not only taking pictures, but handling wind, which had been one of my issues as well (it being March, the windy month, in the southeast U.S.). At this point, I was already familiar with their lineup, so I went straight to the model I kept seeing in those lists: the HS720E.<br /><br />The drone had a 4K capable camera, electronic image stabilization, and GPS. I was excited to see the price and quickly decided to buy it. The morning it came in, winds were 15 mph with 28 mph gusts. I approached flying cautiously, but just had to see how it handled in those conditions. After my experience with the non-GPS drones, I was flabbergasted. I launched it and there it sat, hovering in the air, not moving more than a foot from the target with gusts and reliably moving right back to where it started each and every time.<br /><br />Each day since, the wind has been a challenge and would be for nearly any drone, but I've managed to take it up at some point each day, getting more and more comfortable sending this $300 object whirling off into the air. In-fact, I'm more comfortable sending this $300 drone through the air than I was the $100 one.<br /><br />The skills I picked up manually flying the HS340 and HS110D and ensuring it remained in the same spot were useful but are seeming less and less needed with the HS720E. This thing really does stay where you put it and the distance and height indicators on the remote are extremely useful. I would wager that you could fly this entirely with those two indicators because you always know exactly how high and far it is from the launch site.<br /><br />The features in the app seem to work well and offer a wealth of options concerning the RTH feature. If you're using this for the first time and seeing that it doesn't fly far, be aware that it comes in beginner mode. I was extremely happy to see this.<br /><br />By default, the drone won't fly higher or father than 49 feet. You can change those to the maximum range or decide to keep them at a lower setting to keep you in the clear. Say, for instance, there are trees all around you at a distance of 100 feet and canopies extending out, but at a heigh of 100 feet. You can set the maximum distance and height to, say, 90 feet, and never worry about the drone drifting into the trees.<br /><br />Beyond that, the GPS adds so much more than automatic hovering. You can define the path you want it to follow using a map inside the Ophelia Go app. You take the drone above the treetops and draw out your path. After following it you can use the return-to-home feature to bring it right back to you (just make sure you set your maximum height and distance settings properly!).<br /><br />The camera quality doesn't disappoint, though it's certainly not a Go-Pro. Although it can take shots in nearly any level of light, images look best when taken with good lighting. The camera looked a bit washed out on the HS110D, but not on the HS720E. When my wife saw the first video she said, ""You could take shots for real movies with that."" It's really smooth, even when the drone has a considerable amount of drift. No, it's not the same level of stabilization you get from a mount of course, but for my purposes, it's absolutely perfect.<br /><br />The ability to angle the camera was even more useful than I thought as well. I can easily tilt it down when manually landing or taking off to ensure I maintain position, not needing to rely quite as much on how adept my depth perception is. When you tilt it to maximum position, you do see the props, but tilting it down just slightly gets over this and is in-fact a perfect angle for aerial photography. The way I look at it, the straight-forward view on this drone is best for FPV.<br /><br />Not considering the flying abilities for a moment, this drone just feels solid. While the lightness of the HS110D was impressive in its own way, the heaviness of this is impressive in another. It's just enough to add more wind handling capabilities and has 43% more battery power than the HS110D to-boot, so they obviously found a great balance between weight and capability. I've been buying electronics for, gosh... sigh, I'm old... 30 years now and I can tell you this is just pure quality. It feels like a premium item.<br /><br />I know this review is getting longer and longer, but there are just so many impressive features here. The case the product comes with is extremely nice and I don't see it wearing out anytime soon. I would have expected to pay close to $50for the case alone. And, considering the batteries cost $45 on Amazon, you wouldn't necessarily expect to get 2 of them, but Holy Stone gives you an extra one. They also give you some extra props, although I decided to go ahead and buy some extras.<br /><br />Well, the wind just died down and I'm going back out with my drone! I hope this review can provide some insight. If you're nerve-wracked over whether to make such a pricey purchase, but you've had fun with less expensive drones and want to take a step-up, I'd say to go ahead and buy it! If you can afford the more expensive drones but are considering this because it seems to have the features you want, I'd tell you to buy it too! I've seen plenty of videos where people have a DJI or Parrot along with this one and are testing them both out, often with more success out of the Holy Stone.<br /><br />Look, I know there's got to be a reason to buy a $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000 drone, but I'm not on a tight production timeline, trying to get a movie filmed in the face of hurricane strength winds, I don't need this for espionage, and I'm not trying to deliver anything with it or rescue fallen hikers - I think the HS720E is perfect and I'm extremely happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Note: If you're having trouble with video stuttering, it could be your SD card. I was having that issue and purchased a new SD card today with higher write speeds. A quick test showed the problem was resolved, but I haven't taken any stunning videos or photos with the new card just yet.<br /><br />Video Note: The winds died down enough for me to take it up. This video is brief. I set the return to home to 75 feet, pressed auto-takeoff, then return-to-home. I've tested the RTH upwards of 40 times at this point with no issue. I'll be posting a better video demonstrating panning and the like as soon as I'm able to get to a field or park. Also please note that after watching this video on the reviews page, I notice the Amazon player has pixelization when the tree is in-frame and stutters. The video from the drone was perfect with no stuttering and no pixelization artifacts. The quality, although close, does also appear to be slightly lower on the Amazon page.<br /><br />4/23 Update: The video the note above referenced has been replaced, but I wanted to leave it and the other notes there for posterity. I've had a chance to take the drone to a local park and fly unencumbered. I've had no change in opinion, this drone is awesome.<br /><br />The newly posted video is a step-up from the previous and compiled from clips taken once the wind died down a bit in April. While I'm pretty happy with it, it wasn't a planned montage. My next goal will be to completely plan out each shot before flying and editing. I'll post an update once it's ready!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71c+Vr5iTHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71c+Vr5iTHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71c+Vr5iTHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHO7E4WJJGIEEWLFQVGND6AEOU4Q,1648309301803,1,True
84,4.0,2nd HS drone. 1st one wasn't good. This one is great so far but App needs improvement. UPDATED.,"UPDATE 2: Went to fly the drone to take a video to send to HS since they requested it showing the app issue I’ve been having. As soon as the drone lifted off the ground it became unresponsive. Just kept flying up and away. Tried manual controls on the remote, nothing. Tried emergency stop button, nothing. It’s like it just didn’t want to respond to anything. After a few emails back and forth with HS customer service where they asked me a bunch of questions, they have agreed to send me a replacement. I’m hoping the replacement drone doesn’t have these issues. The app issue seems to still be the same. So I’m also hoping that gets fixed soon. I think it’s a great drone but the original issues with the app and now this fly away situation, makes me have doubts about this drone. But I’m staying optimistic and hopeful. Maybe the original one was just a fluke and got past HS quality assurance dept. Will update review once I receive the replacement.<br /><br />UPDATE 1: Been in contact with HS customer service regarding the app issue. Drone keeps loosing connectivity with phone. FPV looses connectivity and no image is displayed. Even within close proximity. HS customer service is telling me to try with Android device. Told them I don't own an Android device. They then told me to borrow an Android device in order to try the Android version of the Ophelia Go app. At this point, unless they can actually help with this issue, I may just have to return the drone. Not much choice left. If the app doesn't work as intended, then I can't use the drone's intelligent flight functions like follow me, tap to fly, ect. Good thing that at least the controller and drone seem to remain connected and I can fly the drone that way. Waiting for a reply from HS customer service. We'll see what they say.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've had this drone for about two weeks now. So far it's been pretty good but also has some issues. More on that below.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Two batteries providing 25 mins of flight time each; timed the flight time. 4K footage is great. EIS helps keep the footage stable. Really fast on high speed. Very stable on low speed. Seems very durable and well built. Even when loosing FPV connectivity, you can continue controlling the drone with the transmitter. LCD screen on transmitter is great and flight telemetry is great to have. Love the red & green lights on the bottom. Along with the white landing lights. They're great at night when identifying the drone in the dark sky. The RTH feature is great. Comes back on it's on when battery is low or when loosing connectivity. Having the GPS and RTH feature, it seems impossible to loose the drone. The single button props unlock is great and different from other drones where you have to use a combination of both joysticks.<br /><br />I don't want to fault the drone itself for the below but you can have the hardware without the software and vice versa.<br /><br />Cons:<br />With the latest app update on iOS, the app keeps crashing. Also, when the drone goes past the 500M FPV distance limitation, the image freezes but doesn't refresh when back within range. It's even loosing connectivity while it's within the 500M FPV range. When trying the waypoints feature the map on the app doesn't load up, and when it does, it's very laggy. Comparing this to other drone apps where you can see the actual drone on the app screen/map, it doesn't show it on the Ophelia Go app. Not a huge fan of the dual battery charger. Battery can easily come disconnected. Seems difficult to use. Would rather have a microUSB connector like on other drones. The only bad thing about RTH is that the drone returns flying in a backwards facing position. You can always spin it around to face the direction it's flying back in, but I think it should do that on it's own.<br /><br />So overall, great drone. Super fun to fly. Great flight time. But the app is not the greatest. Sure you can fly the drone without the app, but then you don't have the features the app is suppose to provide.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHYDGYK3NSPFRY3PN5M2BZ4JHIQA,1633550676012,0,True
85,2.0,Loses connection easily; resolution doesn't look 4K; spare parts n/a,"Update:  Two months ago a spare battery charger wasn't available on Amazon and shipments from China have taken more than the promised 25 days.  Now the conroller for the 720e is not available at the holy stone store or Amazon, where it refers you.  Wondering if this is a discontinued product.<br />  ORIGINAL:  Wanted badly to like this drone.  Packs up neatly; appears solid; runs quieter than DJI and Bebop 2 drones I've used BUT the first major problem I noticed was a LOT of jerkiness.  Which HS now says is partly due to their controller needing an update. However, I was flying with the latest update  available just two days before they said that, so that seems doubtful.  As others have noted here and elsewhere, a simple rotation command results in the drone drifting badly or rotating VERY jerkily.  This, in comparison to my older Bebop 2, and older DJI 3 and 4's.  Of course it is cheaper than DJI.  But the Bebop has only its fisheye lens and no gimbal, and makes this 720E appear to have NO electronic stabilization !  Unless I got a lemon, the resolution was also no better than the Parrot's Bebop 2, when set to highest resolutions available for both video or still shots. The sod field shot did not lend itself to trying to zoom in very well at all.  RANGE:  Most worrisome was that using a Pixel 4xl Android phone in VERY rural areas without broadband service, I still lost connection  within hundreds of feet.  Fortunately, the RTH worked on the controller but not in the Android app.  And the connection did not restore itself automatically--I had to manually re-connect to the drone once it was near my controller/phone location again.  Although the phone indicated a good Wifi connection, the app did not.  This happened twice, in rural areas 10 miles apart, on two separate batteries, fresh, both within less than 500-800' away.  Before that, the video would 'jump' during rotations or manuevers as well.  As others noted, there was a big lag time in video many times, so that you over-rotated or over-corrected because of the great lag.  Never had that happen with Bebop or DJIs.  No apparent reason for that jerkiness or that lag time or lack of feedback time.  I do not know how some of the reviewers got ""cinematography results"" but this was NOT usable footage for anything with an artistic purpose, and almost prevents basic operations, so I returned the unit.  I reported this to HS and maybe 5 different reps emailed me with suggestions.  It appeared they were not reading my details or each other's preceding emails in the chain of emails.  I believe that using 5 gHz in wifi,while less crowded, is not a good choice when trying to get good range--higher frequencies may have greater bandwidth ability, but they usually have less range as tradeoff.  HS reps kept blaming my Google Pixel 4xl as if it did not have dual band wifi,which is clearly not true.  Some other drones connect your cellphone to their controller via usb cable and that provides a more reliable link, not dependent upon radio waves.  HS appears to link your cellphone directly to the drone for app video/telemetry and wifi at 5g and no directional antenna in your phone / drone, is not good for that, IMHO.  The controller, meanwhile, does have at least one active stubby antenna, and fortunately it was able to transmit the Return Home signal to the drone while the cell phone app by HS failed.  Tried to post this several days ago but this site wasn't accepting 'verified purchaser' reviews so I was unable to counteract the higher reviews posted earlier.  In summary, WAY too jerky for no explicable reason (not a wind factor involved there);  way too much lagtime; too short a range despite rural area;  the camera resolution did not appear 4K, subjectively speaking. It would have been even worse on a large screen.  Hoping HS can work out the erratic controller jerkiness, maybe revert to 2gHz wifi linking, and somehow get better resolution recorded to the SD card because my SD card video wasn't that much sharper than what was later played back from SD card at higher rez.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818JjOwMe5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818JjOwMe5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818JjOwMe5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGDRSWUCWBGHG73DAL2CSZURJDZA,1610123007499,0,False

90,5.0,Re-evaluation of Holy Stone 720E,"After doing a reasonable amount of research regarding the average ratings of various drones currently available on Amazon, I selected the HolyStone-720E and was very much looking forward to this item (my birthday present).  Consequently, I re-read the instructions several times, and then placed the drone on the ground and attempted to locate the drone signal with my cell phone.  Sadly, that's as far as I got - it never got off the ground, because no matter what I tried, there was absolutely no drone signal at all.  The familiar names of all the neighboring wi-fi signals from surrounding homes were there - but none from the Holy Stone drone.  My son also tried it several times - but again, no luck.  Finally, we spoke with a Holy Stone Customer Service agent.  After confirming that my Samsung S10+ and my wife's 4 month old Apple phone were both on the 'approved' list, we tried it once again while the agent was still on the phone.  And, once again, a drone signal could not be found.  The agent then checked several phone settings, but they were fine.  He concluded that the drone was faulty and that we should return it and have a replacement sent out.  After concluding this conversation, we even tried my wife's iPhone, without success.  I recognize that no electronic item is 'perfect' and that a certain number will fail once they leave the factory.  While this model had good reviews overall, I did not want to risk going through the same thing with a replacement drone, so I simply chose to return it for credit.  I very much wanted this drone to work.  Based on the number of positive reviews this has received, I believe that it's likely that a replacement would have worked properly.  So, if there is any fault in the situation, it lies with me in not allowing Holy Stone a 'second chance'.<br />==============================<br />I have now upgraded my review of this drone to five stars.  I reconsidered and was sent a second drone to evaluate.  After re-reading all instructions, I took the drone to a nearby park; found a spot with no trees within 75 yards in any direction; then placed it on a large sheet of cardboard (from a box I dismantled).  I am pleased to report that it rose about 50 feet above me and I flew it around me in several directions until I was certain that the controls worked well.  I can now recommend this 720E drone.

Up to this point, all my photography has been still images, mostly for use on their website and occasionally for print purposes. One thing they've been asking me for is drone photography, and so I decided to find a sensibly priced drone with good photo and video capabilities. I watched maybe a dozen online videos and decided that this drone had a good balance of quality, features, and price. I am not disappointed. The learning curve is pretty short, and I was up and running pretty much right away. Controls are easy to master, and there's some duplication between the remote control and your phone, using the prescribed app. Every function worked perfectly; take off is super simple and landing can be done manually or by allowing the drone to return home. I had connection with 17 (yes 17) GPS satellites. I'm not using a 5G phone, but it worked flawlessly with my iPhone X Max. The cell phone holder on the remote control is large enough to handle big phones like this one. There is a limitation to the movement of the drone's camera. It only rotates on one axis. It will pivot up to 90 degrees up or down, but not side to side, etc. For some that might be a problem, but at this price point that's what you can generally expect. The drone comes in a really good case, and has a set of propellers, miscellaneous parts, and a screwdriver. The instruction manual is thick, but that's because it comes in three languages. Mine looked like English, German, and Italian. Anyway, this is a product you need to consider when you put your list together.

107,4.0,Very nice drone. Easy to fly,"This is my second holy stone drone.  My son has a HS110g and I wanted a drone for myself.  After comparing different models, I decided on the hs270e.  It is pretty stable and gives you decent pictures and video.<br /><br />You are not going to be getting DJI quality out of this, but for a fraction of the cost, it is really good.  The image stabilization gives you a pretty smooth video as long as it's not real windy or your not doing real abrupt movements.<br /><br />The drone comes with a nice sturdy carry case that holds everything securely.  The battery charger is a little awkward, but it gets the job done.  It does not come with a power adapter, so make sure you have a 2A usb charger available.<br /><br />There are a couple things I'd like to see improved.  The lights are hard to see when you are flying during the daytime.  Because the drone is so small, it makes it easy to lose track of it while flying.  Also, when you are flying, the lights are red and green to indicate front and back.  Having been around aviation all my life, I am used to red and green lights on aircraft to indicate left and right.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEF5NPNAD6HN3E5GCXX2XRDBCU5A,1611509884062,0,False

However I highly recommend using the slow speed setting until you get accustomed to the controls.<br /><br />I’ve found it to be pretty rugged.  I’ve hit a few things including my house, a chain link fence and some tree branches.  The most severe damage I’ve had is that one prop flew off after impacting the chain link fence.  All that happened there was the 2 screws that hold it onto the motor backed out and the prop flew off.  I was able to reattach it with the provided screws.  If you do crash and I’m sure you will.

112,4.0,"Flys Away Uncontrollably, But HS Support Is Terrific","This is not my first drone, but I thought it would be my best.<br /><br />I received this drone as a Christmas present. I set it up and followed the instructions in the manual. I bonded the blue tooth controller to the drone and performed the calibrations as directed in the manual. Weather was perfect with no wind and the controller showed 16 GPS satellites. I unlocked the props and pressed the takeoff button. The drone rose about 5 or 6 feet in the air and hovered for a minute or two. It did not respond to any control inputs - I tried up down sideways and everything else I could but I got no response from the drone.<br /><br />The drone began drifting to the right on its own and after 15 feet or so it crashed into a tree. I could not get the props to stop turning even holding the lock button down for several minutes. I finally had to reach in and press the power button on the drone itself to stop the blades. I received some lacerations on my hand as shown.<br /><br />I've contacted Holy Stone and they will send me the parts to repair it (although they say it may take 4 to 6 weeks to get them as they come from China). Unfortunately, I don't think I feel comfortable trying to fly this one again as next time it may fly away and cause even more damage.<br /><br />Holy Stone support subsequently sent me a new HS720E to replace the defective unit. The difference is amazing! The new drone obeys control input just as it should. What a change and I've upgraded my review to 4 stars. Holy Stone support is superb!

117,5.0,Maybe I had a defective one.....(but) Holy Stone Customer Service came through!,"UPDATE 12/16/22:<br />This replacement of my original Drone having the issues in stability and loosing control even in hover, seems to be totally free of any of the issues previously noted in my initial review. My review is now 5 stars for what is a very enjoyable flying experience with this drone as well as for the wonderful and prompt replies and support from Holy Stone. Be it a drone, new car or truck, appliance, whatever, a big part of your purchase enjoyment is through excellent support by the manufacturer. I'm totally delighted in how Holy support (overseas) replied to many questions I had for my replacement drone. Well done!<br /><br />In that my flight prep for each flight was identical as well as the location and excellent wifi and GPS signals, I'm very sure I had a bad drone (soft/firmware or mechanical/hardware issues).<br /><br />My flights have been short for the time being and in some cases, in a slight breeze, and yet, I've not had any stability or control issues. I've done mostly short range fights initially (300 yards or so max), but, in these flights, my HS730E has performed very nicely. As long as this model remains available (not discontinued or<br />no longer available) I'll continue to update this review as time goes on. With the cold of winter biting here n the NE, my HS720E is temporarily ""in the hanger"" with more flights planned come Spring 2022!<br /><br />This model is a winner as well as the manufacturer support. 5 stars for each!<br /><br />(my initial review is still here near the bottom of my review in case other's have a drone with issues!)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/29/21:<br />Holy Stone customer service was prompt, courteous and very supportive! They have shipped me a replacement drone which I just received, to hopefully fly without the the same issues of the Drone that this replaced. I will update this review asap after several test flights in early September.  (5 stars for their customer service!).<br /><br />UPDATE 8/27/2021:<br />On 8/26//2021 I sent Holy Stone an email (through Amazon) with my issues detailed, noting my defective HS720E. Holy Stone was quick to reply (1 day) and has offered me a replacement to try that should not have the same problems. I am awaiting a reply from them on how to proceed. I'll update this review accordingly<br />once I hear back from them and if I do receive a replacement to review, I'll update this review at that point.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I have a full size DJI Phantom 3 so not a Drone newbie here.  I picked up this smaller Drone for travel and/or quick flights with minimal setup time and procedure required.<br /><br />I did 6 test flights within just 12 feet off the ground and right near me. Compass was recalibrated for each flight. GPS had 12 satellites with a very good signal. Batteries were all at peak output.<br /><br />All systems were go per the App, Remote and blinking lights on the drone.<br /><br />For all flights, I had a reasonably stable hover and flight direction up to about 90 seconds and then this Drone began to drift off in one direction at high speed as if a loss of GPS or my remote signal was lost.  In each case I had to UNLOCK the rotors immediately or I'd have had collisions.  (Return-to-Home failed to respond at all).<br /><br />I was in a clear field, calm day, no wind and with absolutely nothing around to interfere with the Drone signal.<br /><br />The Drone felt quite hot after these short test flights. I'm just thinking in that all pre-flight prep was done correctly, some component was over-heating and malfunctioning at about the same time-frame for each flight. This issue seemed more a function of flight time when the problem began in each flight, rather then a random problem occurring during flight at any point in time.<br /><br />While I did not time each flight, the Drone became erratic in what I felt was a very similar timeframe from the prior flights  (same issue  began w/i a ~10 second window for each flight).<br /><br />Rather than request an exchange, I counted my blessings and returned this Drone with plans to purchase a different make of Drone.

129,5.0,Beginner friendly,"I have never owned a drone before, this was my first. Something youll learn right away is to fly above the trees. Trying to fly at 6 or 7ft above the ground with obstacles around, you'll eventually crash into something. Blades are easy to replace, just pay attention to the letters and numbers on them. Takes some really great pictures with the optional SD card installed, and videos aren't that bad either. I've crashed twice since I've had it, last time was into the side of the garage. It can take a pretty good beating and keep on going. Make sure you download a UAV weather app. Certain times you won't want to fly due to windy conditions. Max altitude is 400ft, it will take you longer to come down than go up. Dense fog, you can fly above it and look around, but be warned, condensation builds up on the arms and near the motors because of the blades spinning.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MKbXzQHaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MKbXzQHaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61MKbXzQHaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61trXou8wiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61trXou8wiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61trXou8wiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iRI4Z6H+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iRI4Z6H+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iRI4Z6H+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFJT2XJOSBCBCXP6BV3GF4EU257A,1605032636925,0,True

134,5.0,Holy Stone drone,"I have found this drone to be very easy to learn to use. I started with a more basic model and moved up to this model. The drone will hover in place and handles nicely. I am not a fan of how the docking clip for your phone is right on top of the buttons on the front of the remote control. Although I am not sure if it is me or the device, but when I connect my phone to the drone wi-fi, the distance the drone flies out is limited to about 20 meters. Without the wi-fi in use the drone will go about 100 meters off into the distance. Of course, without wi-fi there are no pictures stored on the SD card.

Amazing GPS performance to return to launch site.

It does seem to lose connection with transmitter much too often -- more cause for concern.  The single worst problem is the funky battery charger.  Batteries are very difficult to mate; there's no visual alignment cues and they don't stay securely attached as you set them back down on the table.

170,1.0,Don’t waste your time.,"Annoyed with the whole drone. The quality of pics and videos are horrible. The drone does its OWN thing. The only reliable functions are up, down, and backwards. It chooses when it wasn’t to come forward, left, right, or turn around. I saw this complaint a few times and thought “maybe it was a glitch just for them”.. nope. It DOESNT LISTEN. Granted, the photos could’ve been dark because of the position of the sun BUT when the functions limits me on what I can do it’s but so much I can fix. I edited a photo and attached it, it looks brighter but we still look like blubs. But then again, I put the function on “follow me” and it went around and the quality is still horrible. While it was following me it randomly goes up and down for no real reason. I tried to attach a video but it didn’t Work it.

I have tried there smaller drones as well as the bigger GPS drones but this one has basically everything. There are various modes including the follow-me, tap fly, and one where it orbits in a circle. The camera quality is great too and in daylight it is as good as some of the GoPro cameras. When it gets dark though the quality decreases slightly as it does in all cameras, but it is still very good quality. In my video I have EIS off but all the other camera settings are set to default. It flies pretty fast as well in the fast mode and flies almost 25 minutes per battery which is great. Much better than DJI spark and the other small DJI drones. Also, on your phone when you are flying, you can zoom into any spot on the camera which is pretty cool as well although it doesn't show up on the recording. Its amazing how much you get for the price honestly, including the case and the extra battery as well.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71frFNmTWoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71frFNmTWoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71frFNmTWoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFW3GIKYVE5WM44FNPWJN4OVFS3Q,1600725408468,0,True

The HS720 was supposed to supply a flight time of 26 minutes and only came with one battery.<br />Does that mean that this company has actually reduced the flight time for each battery by 3 minutes each?<br />The app on my smartphone started rendering the drone useless by no longer allowing me to steer left or right while using the app (3 uses in 60 days).

197,5.0,The HS720E is a Grand Slam Home Run!,"[[VIDEOID:37b32e4553bb0352c253c6145b631491]] Holy Stone has hit a home run with the HS720E.  As a drone hobbyist and amateur filmmaker, I was excited to see the latest upgrade to Holy Stone’s product line is a 4k, foldable quad with EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).  It is especially impressive that this value-priced drone’s camera is equipped with a premium quality EIS image sensor from Sony.  The high quality camera (with a tilt angle that is controllable during flight) produces excellent photos and image stabilized video that exceeds expectations (note that installing an SD card onboard produces optimal video quality, compared to the video saved on your smartphone through the drone’s WiFi).  The camera produces smooth, stable video with amazing cinematic results, which is extraordinary for a drone in this price range. (See attached video and photos).<br />The flight operation of the HS720E is highly impressive and includes features that are comparable to drones costing much, much more.  The HS720E, equipped with brushless motors and 6 axis gyro, is easy to fly and very responsive to the pilot’s commands.  Easy flight features include one touch take-off and landing, reactive joystick controls and even, level hovering.  Reaching heights of 400 feet (120 meters) while maintaining FPV (First Person View) contact is a breeze for this quad.  The equipped GPS enables a number of fun and convenient functions such as RTH (return to home), in addition to functions available through the free Ophelia GO phone app which includes orbit (around a preset point), follow me and tap fly (along a programmed path).<br />The HS720E is shipped with two batteries for a total of over 45 minutes of flight time, a transmitter, a charger and extra propellers, all of which fit neatly into the included compact carrying case.<br />I absolutely love this drone and highly recommend the Holy Stone HS720E for the beginner and experienced pilot.  It is a remarkable drone that is fun and easy to fly, takes excellent, stable videos and is backed by the responsive Holy Stone support team.  Anyone considering the HS720E will be happy with this high quality, value priced drone that includes features found only in much more expensive drones.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dfd3plUcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dfd3plUcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dfd3plUcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E8KQqrB6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E8KQqrB6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E8KQqrB6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8123SjNAiKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8123SjNAiKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8123SjNAiKL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ABC4wQemL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ABC4wQemL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ABC4wQemL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGZGLSS2DEHF4QKCHBXYBZO64QAQ,1600462433770,6,True

204,5.0,Outstanding Drone for First Time User!,"What I mean by my title is: This drone was purchased for a 10-year old for Christmas. The only other drones my son has ever had were the $25-50 models you see in the malls. For the price tag, I am totally impressed...<br />First of all, my 10-year old can fly it as well as I can. It’s extremely accurate with GPS enabled. We flew it off of a small table in the backyard. Flew it up to 400 feet in the air, and out of our sight. The battery on my cell phone died so we lost the HD video feed. To be honest, we panicked a little bit. But we knew how to press the “Return to Home” feature. This baby, returned (from out of our sight—probably 1/4 to 1/2 mile away) and landed right back on the table it took off from! Before seeing this, I would have assumed only drones upwards of $1500 would do such a thing. Unbelievable...<br />I can’t find any flaws in this drone. The main thing higher cost drones have are object detection and avoidance. So you do have to be sure not to fly it into trees or other objects. Of course, in our flat lands there isn’t anything taller than 100 feet, so that’s not an issue. When we accidentally get too close to something we just hit the Return to Home function and the drone immediately flies upward and avoids the object. It’s an easy “bailout” tool. Then if you desire, you can a cancel the Return to Home and continue flying. If you hover it about 5 feet off the ground and try to move it with your hand (from underneath), it will speed up and try to correct itself back to its original hover point. The technology in this drone is amazing. We haven’t tried it in high winds. But moderate winds don’t affect it greatly. Of course, quick gusts of wind will briefly knock it off course a couple feet. But no big deal. 2 batteries is a huge benefit. Be sure to have both charged up because 25 minutes doesn’t last as long as you want it to! Solid construction. We have accidentally dropped it more than once from 5 feet to a hard surface—no damage at all. I was actually surprised at how much it weighs. The cheaper mall drones are light as a feather. This unit feels like it should be too heavy to fly. Don’t you believe it! This thing can take off vertically and fly to 100 feet—or more—ridiculously fast. Nighttime flying is fun also. The lights underneath and the “spot light” which shines down make it easy to see at 400 feet high at night. Biggest reason I think some people have had issues, is improper calibration. We do calibrate it before each flight. It only takes a minute and gives it great stability. If you’ve never owned a drone and don’t want to spend your whole paycheck on one. This one should make anyone happy at the lowest possible price point to get a drone that even experts would enjoy. I’ll probably get another so I have one to fly with my son!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFIVN3JDSXENOXYTMAQZQQGMX4AA,1610136373042,0,True

206,1.0,Drone does not respond to controller,"I bought this drone for my son-in-law last Christmas. He and my daughter left to travel the US in a motor home and while traveling he tried the new drone while they were back east. He told me it wasn't functioning correctly so I told him we'll figure it out when they come back west. We recently tried it at my home and once airborne it began to act unusual by oscillating and not responding to the controller then crashed (I own a drone and have flown it for years, it is new to my son-in-law). We changed the setting out of beginner thinking that may have something to do with it, wrong. We got it in the air again and it momentarily responded to the controller- but- it developed a mind of it's own again flew into a tree- fell out of the tree and broke one of the arms. We looked for a new arm online to discover they are expensive and very difficult to replace. He left the drone with me because I wanted to epoxy the arm back together, which I did. Once airborne... again... I flew it around my home and it would respond intermittently to the controller. I wanted to take some aerial photos of my home when totally out of the blue it takes off flying away from me at a high pace and wouldn't respond whatsoever to the controller. It headed into the hills next to us and my wife and I took three hiking trips to find it but to no avail, total loss.  FORTUNATELY it didn't injure anyone or go through a neighbors window or damage someone's property. AVOID THIS DRONE!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHJIVMJA724VSDDQ5K6LM6PBMWTQ,1671552351474,1,True

It went down faster than I could have with the controls. It was almost directly above me, so the signal wouldn’t have been an issue. It hit my roof, bounced off, and landed in mowed grass. On a good note, there was only a very small crack on the chassis. The battery was ejected and appeared undamaged. The arms and propellers stayed on. I didn’t fly it again so I don’t know if it suffered internal damage. I had a SD card in. The card saved the first flight, but not the second. My phone saved the second flight, but only right up until it went down. At the time of the crash, the automatic circling mode was activated and I only operated the camera. I attached the video. I read more of the reviews and this appears to be a relatively common issue.

212,3.0,"Reasonable value, but has limitations","I'm not the drone master. But I have owned more expensive drones as well as cheaper ones. And as expected this one falls in the middle.<br /><br />It flies well and the camera and video functions work well.<br /><br />LIMITATIONS<br /><br />*ANY wind. For the size of the drone it should be better at cutting wind... but with a very light breeze, this will get along way off course.<br /><br />*The phone ""holder"" attached to the remote control is really non functioning.<br /><br />*It lands very poorly, both in manual mode as well as the return to home mode. There is no landing gear so the blades will come extremely close to the ground even if it is flat ground. And it tends to bounce quite a bit. Even if the commands are given for it to touch down, it bauchs at this move way too much.  You can land perfectly on hard flat concrete and its still gonna want to bounce a few times. I highly doubt these blades last very long without some sort of landing gear to keep it more than a 1/2 inch off the ground.<br /><br />*This is where everyone's gonna decide that I am an idiot... Do not try to stop this drone with your hands. I hit the return home key in which caused it to fly straight into a low tree.  It would not stop trying to fly upward and was destroying itself.<br />""When the return to home button is pressed, the drone no longer has the ability to avoid obstacles.""  Even if you are low to the ground and near where you started, the drone is going to rise quickly to try to acquire better satellite reception before returning to the original GPS point. So the return to home button is really only a function to be used if you lose sight of the drone or are in a wide open space. That however, is similar to many other drones. It's not trying to find the quickest path home. It's trying to find the correct path and it doesn't initially know what that is... So it turns off one part of its brain in order for the other to function. This was a scenario in which that was a disaster.<br /><br />All that being said the drone survived the crash and destruction of my hands perfectly fine. 32 bandaids later, everything's back in operation. *You should have seen the pictures before the bandaids.

That being said when completed per manufacturers instructions it flys very stable even in stronger wind but as with any flyer you are responsible to understand the gusts and use good judgement when completing preflight.  The camera with Image stabilization offers excellent shots,  and stable video and when paired with optional sd card the 4k is impressive.  You would be hard pressed to find features and quality like this in other drones.  Holystone did very well.  The customer support and service is very good and I see this a strong selling point as well.  It is a heavier drone which falls under FAA guidlines in the USA but with that comes orbit, follow me and way point options as well as a litany of features which make the HS720e a immense bang for you buck.  It is not necessarily a beginner drone as it is so well equipped with features and quality far greater than an entry level flyer.  It is however something with a little practice and careful attention to becoming versed with the manual while taking advantage of the videos placed on youtube I would be comfortable saying it is a good idea to start with it if you are willing to take the time to learn its features and controls before rushing head long into the skys.  Return to home,  one button take off and land, beginner mode ; its a very impressive drone and the best option if features matter and you dont want to drop huge money.  Holystone did a great job on this bird and Im excited to see whats next.  Happy flying, buy this flyer you wont be disappointed.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715dx8p3wZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715dx8p3wZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715dx8p3wZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IzDdMZveL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IzDdMZveL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IzDdMZveL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wn+9ls-tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wn+9ls-tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wn+9ls-tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHJWXXZHNRAS6PBCQB2CQHMTM3FA,1655775473421,0,True

244,5.0,Best Drone for the Money,"Holy Stone HS720e<br />I ordered the HS720e off of Amazon after reading all the reviews and watching all the YouTube videos. It looked to be the best drone in my price range. I received it in two days. Taking it to the small field behind my subdivision, I tested all the  things it was able to do. I was very pleased and it responded well to all. A few days later my son who had just purchased a DJI Mini2 and I went to fly our drones together. My first flight was going well when the Wifi to the drone went out about 20 feet from me. The drone went to the side and landed on some grass by itself. Upon inspection I found that the Wifi would no longer connect at all. I tried to connect several times and the same the next day. Nothing. I called Amazon and they said to send it back and reorder another one. I had it the next day. A couple of days later my son and I went to a park to fly. All I can say is, this Drone is amazing. It is all that the internet said it was. It flies well in light wind, takes amazing photos and videos. My son was a little set back when we tested our return to homes. After several minutes of flying mine landed in the center of the landing pad twice out of three times and about half off the mat the third time. His DJI was about 3 feet away each time. I have three other drones and after many hours of research, I don't think there is a better  drone on the market at his price range. I would recommend it and I would buy a Holy Stone drone again.

With a overcast ski and no ambient light the camera wasn't able to show much.  The HS720E popped of the ground and held in place perfectly.  After a calming breath I tested forward, back and side to side and the went straight up to about 50 feet. The fun was soon over because the battery had not been charged so quickly everything was beeping and landing.  I was able to leave work early so hurried home to try the HS720E during day light and a fresh battery.  I was still careful not to rush but this drone is very stable in 6 to 10 mph wind and camera is very steady.

It is more than capable, but thd controller is iffy and the drone to phone link is hard to establish and maintain. Changing batteries means doing it all over agsin with fingers crossed. I may try a secondary battery hookup so reprogramming isn't needed. The proprietary battery connection has its faults and the charging system is just plain stupidly designed. I got an aftermarket REAL charger and building my own charging dock, which is far faster and safer. HS has a fairly good reputation, so I am puzzled by their complacency.  Under the same circumstances I would buy again, now I would likely hold out for the far more expensive one with a stellar reputation.  ALTHOUGH, I  do like a challenge  and employing my own ideas. I will fix and document those online.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+yh8O6jL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+yh8O6jL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a+yh8O6jL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHPPALNV2C6DJ3QRJRGHKICYZ6PA,1608436780225,0,True
268,5.0,Getting the best out of my drone,"I'm new to operating a drone.  I've had a very small, unsophisticated drone a few years ago but moving up to the HS-720e was a major step in performance and cost but after reading and watching various videos, I decided to take the plunge and purchase it.  However, I did reach out to Holy Stone and was introduced to Zoey.  She was so helpful that once I communicated through a few emails, I was committed and purchased the unit that night.  The experience with Amazon was also great and the product arrived one or two days ahead of schedule.  This was fantastic and I was able to finally put my hands on the unit.  It was bigger than I anticipated but more importantly, it was a 'solidly' built drone.  Due to rainy weather for several days, I was unable to get out to fly the drone.  The other evening, I finally flew it.  It did exactly what the videos said it would do.  I synced my phone to the controller using the app.  Once that happened and I connected the drone to the GPS system, I turned on the rotors and pushed the 'up' toggle.  The drone rose to about 6 feet and stayed there just like the instructions state.  I was able to walk over to the drone and walk around it while it held its position.  This was an amazing feeling not having to keep pushing buttons to hold the location.  I got bold and pushed the up toggle.  It went up, up, up and up but it held the same GPS position.  On the way up, I took several pictures and I've shared two of them with this post.  I did not fear the drone flying off into the horizon to be gone forever.  In that it was night, I turned on the landing lights to see where it was in the night sky.  I was able to move it in different directions while holding a certain altitude.  After about 10 minutes, I decided it was getting too dark to continue flying so I pushed the 'home' button and guess what, the drone returned home landing within a few feet of its takeoff point.  What a great experience and I'm looking forward to spending more time with the drone to become a better pilot.  If what I've shared was helpful, I hope you get your HS720e and join the drone world.  If you do, make sure you register your drone and you get registered so you will be a safe drone operator.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vMn1UoCrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vMn1UoCrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vMn1UoCrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zZSv31yYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zZSv31yYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zZSv31yYL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFNBPOGGCPFWA52IRV6G3IVRSJVQ,1661305408539,8,True
269,5.0,Great for Biginners and intermidiate pilots,I bought this drone from a 3rd party at a huge discount. The first 2 hours I had it I snapped the right rear arm.  The replacement was not available on amazon so I reached out via twitter and got a response within a few hours. They sent me a replacement arm which only took 5 days from china to get to me. Replacing the arm is not a project for someone who has never soldering before but with a bit a soldering practice and some out of the box thinking replacing the arm is simple. The drone is amazing and the Return Home feature has saved my drone a few times already. Overall super satisfied. The controller is kind of flimsy and will not hold your iPhone 11 as its too large. But other that the controller feeling cheap it works great.,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AG3GTT4VYFOGG7IJIG5QP5HAZF7A,1654454386277,0,False

277,4.0,Great beginners drone and tougher than it looks!,"Though the age recommendation is 16+ I bought this drone for my 11 1/2 year old son who, like many children his age these days, is very advanced in the use of everything electronic.<br /><br />We kept the controls limited for beginner's use as is the default setting (can be modified through the app) and his first three or four full flights were flawless. He tried the follow me and point of interest features and landed with auto home and manually with no more than a slight bounce. He loved the handling immediately.<br /><br />It was not until it got a bit dusk and he wanted to try out the led landing lights that things went awry.<br /><br />Since he was just going to rise it upwards to see the landing lights, then land. He used the controller without the cell phone/app. As he lifted off and the drone was just a foot or so off the ground, he tried to turn on the landing lights. A push-button actually SHARED with the high speed button. Well. The drone took off like a bat outta hell!<br /><br />My son had trouble seeing the controls as they are neither illuminated, nor otherwise made to be visible in low light conditions but despite his panic he swears that he immediately started ""spamming"" the return home button... to no avail. We watched in horror as the drone skimmed the road, bouncing at least twice, then slammed into a sand dune less than a foot off the ground. When we got to it, three motors had completely stopped as one continued to furiously spin kicking up sand everywhere. It would not shut off, stop or even slow down and I couldn't get the battery out because of the sand wedged in every crack and crevice. After what seemed like an eternity, my son's persistent spamming of the emergency off button on the controls and my pushing the off button on the drone finally worked and the drone shut down.<br /><br />Surprisingly, upon my initial inspection I found only a few minor scratches and that one of the rubber landing feet was half pulled out... that's it. I mean this thing seriously hit the road at full speed, though thankfully at a good skid angle, and then bounced up into that dune hitting it hard. No broken arms or even props. But, I was sure that the three dead motors got fried. Despite my assurances, my son was heartbroken.<br /><br />I took the entire drone apart and while manually turning each of the motors back and forth to loosen any sand I used an entire can of compressed air and then a fine brush to clean out a LOT of beach sand from within the entire unit. I then popped in a fresh battery and lo and behold... it started right up! Good as new!<br /><br />While taking it apart I watched a few YouTube videos to see if something similar happened to anyone else with regard to the sand filled, stopped motors. Closest thing I found was a guy that crashed landed in a lake, retrieved it two weeks later, let it dry out thoroughly, popped in a new battery... and it too was as good as new! Clearly, the electronics of this drone are VERY well made.<br /><br />Anyway. Though I think illuminated or at least more highly visible remote controls would be a plus, and that the landing lights/speed button should be separate... hmm... and despite the fact that we still don't really know WHY the drone took off and wouldn't stop... this is truly a well made drone perfect for a beginner or pro alike.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGYQKF4OYFB2YWYEGSV7FTXCUWTA,1609376495209,0,True

I would be seriously remiss if I did not mention the fit, finish and the quality of all of the items included in the HS720E box.  Inside the box is a high quality carrying case with handle for the drone, its controller, its batteries for the drone itself and also the charger and cables. The molding of the HS720E ABS body is smooth leaving no gaps for dust or excessive moisture to enter into the electronics.  It is water resistant, not waterproof! The controller (transmitter) design is ergonomically correct and the display is easy to read.  The brushless motors on the drone are lightweight yet powerful and because of the brushless design, they generate less heat and draw less current than do a brushed motors design.  The owners manual has easily readable text and is well laid out.  A product is absolutely no better than their customer support, and Holy Stone is a standard bearer in this regard. I had an issue with my HS720E and the company sent me out a replacement drone immediately.  I had dealt primarily with Dennis of Holy Stone and he was knowledgeable and very insightful regarding the anomaly I had experienced with my original HS720E.  You can certainly pay far more for a quality drone than what Holy Stone asks for their HS720E, but all things considered, the advanced fundamental features of their drone works very well indeed. A tip, for what it's worth, read the owner's manual throughly and make sure that you understand the sequencing of your preflight checks and setup.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PpYIAhNFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PpYIAhNFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PpYIAhNFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFSNE6QDJYUFOQI67H5WFO56VNPQ,1622735196191,0,True

They gave a variety of solutions to include changing the sd card, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the phone app. None of these options were helpful in clearing up the images. After going back and forth with multiple emails, staff, and suggestions, Holy Stone informed me their camera does not have autofocus and there was nothing else that could be done.

296,5.0,Unbeatable feature/price ratio,"As a first time drone purchaser and user, I found this drone to be easy to get started with. With GPS and stabilization, the drone is very stable, even in reasonably windy conditions.  While I understand it will take a lot of practice to become a competent pilot, the HS720e seems very responsive and easy to control. There IS a huge learning curve to get good, I'd assume, with anything you need to control in the air through 4 axes (pitch, yaw, roll, forward/backward).<br />The thing is, its FUN, even if difficult, to get good at it.<br />So far, I  only have 2 relaively minor criticisms of this drone. The batteries take forever to charge (at least 5 hours each), and even though the charger holds/connects 2 batteries, it only charges 1 at a time.  And, for reasons I could not figure out, I could not get it to fly past some apparent restrictions in distance and height for the first several flights. I tried all settings possible and couldn't figure it out. Then, all of a sudden, those restrictions wre gone. Frustrating at first cause there was no way to find out why or how to fix.  Reminded me of when I first got a Segway Mini-Pro as it's app, software purposely limited speed with beginners as an obvious safety feature. Except in Segway's case, the instructions tell you up front. If, in the case of this Holy Stone product, the glitch was programmed by the developers, it should have been disclosed.<br />Overall, though, for the money, this must be one of the best, especially for beginners.  Has many of the features of much pricier drones including Return to home, 1 key take off/landing, orbiting, point of interest, tripod mode, etc. Don't think I could have made a better 1st time purchase. I do plan to get real good at flying and then will look a higher end models.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGRKMRNCNMCFG4EISDX3XJZIVDMA,1603813484229,1,True

298,5.0,Exceptional Customer Service!!,"In January 2021 I purchased my 1st drone so I'm a novice.  I was over confident in my skills and crashed during first session, breaking an arm off.  I contacted Holy Stone to inquire about purchasing a replacement arm and was shocked when they said they'd ship a replacement arm at no charge!  Service rep was very pleasant and professional as well.  A couple of weeks later the arm arrived and I installed after reviewing the You Tube video that Holy Stone directed me to during our initial conversations  (great insight Holy Stone for visual instructional tool!)  Repair with video reference is pretty straight forward and all was well for a few days, but then encountered an issue with the drone connecting to WiFi.  I contacted Holy Stone via email and they offered several trouble shooting tips, but at the end of the day we could not sort the issue out.  Customer service at this point has been really great but here's where Holy Stone tipped over to World Class - because we could not overcome the WiFi issue, Holy Stone replaced the drone!!  I certainly will remember this exceptional customer service experience and recommend this company to anyone looking for a recreational drone.

300,5.0,Great first drone!,I based this purchase off other reviews on good video/pics and great for beginners. I am glad to experience that this Holy Stone HS720E drone is a good starting point for my first. I was able to get up and flying in no time at all. The one touch take off and landing is awesome. Having the option between low and high speed makes it very easy to get the hang of the controls. Drone hovered in place when I let go of the controls so I could gather my bearings before practicing another loop around. Videos and pictures look great and smooth. Battery lasts about 23 minutes like advertised. It does take a few hours to charge. Only complaint I have is that the controller barely fits my phone (samsung Note10+) and I need to take the case off as well. I have to be very careful that the controller actually has ahold of my phone. The app to use with this holy stone drone has worked flawless so far as well. Overall I am quite happy with my purchase and do recommend this for a beginner like myself. Very easy and enjoyable to fly. And do make sure you register with the FAA since it is over 250grams.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-EX7nxYHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-EX7nxYHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-EX7nxYHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8142wh2LteL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8142wh2LteL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8142wh2LteL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFZ7FESAZNGBTKJC6GK57SOAJNYA,1606846682455,0,True

The first time I flew the drone I had no issues. I live next to a lake I posted video and pictures. The drone did everything it said it could do.  Two days later I attempt to fly it again. When you hit the take off button it suppose go up 5 feet and hover. This time I hit the take off button it raised up and took off like a bat out of hell  it went left straight out in the middle of the lake and dove right in the water. I had not control of it. It would not respond to the remote control. Less than 5 seconds over $300 vanish. I don't have money like that to throw away. I suggest you do not buy this drone. I am screwed.<br /><br />Update:  I call Amazon and they wasn't going to help me. Because the drone went into the lake and I couldn't return it they said they couldn't do anything.

So after a couple of weeks, the $40 off coupon drew me over the edge, and i ordered it.  This model does require FAA Registration, but i was pleasently surprised how easy that was to obtain.  Then the 1st flight.  Lets back up a bit, based on my experience with the 510. I expected to crash at least a couple times, but no.  5 flights in, and not a single white cane flight.  When hovering, Holy Stone describes it as TriPod mode, and on low wind days. That it most surely is.  I am an experienced ROV pilot, and operating this drone is so intuative.  Great job by the engineeeing/software team.  Still photographs are good, video and color are fantastic in the video.  Only thing i would like to know how to do, is capture the elevation and heading data in the video.  Not something I want to see in every video.  But I would love the option.

317,2.0,Terrible experience may have been an app issue,"This was the 2nd drone of this model I tried. This drone has all the bells and whistles that I wanted. The camera was outstanding.  The problem may have been the app Ophelia Go, I am not sure. I would sometimes have to calibrate the drone 2 or 3 times before takeoff. Other times the drone was calibrated, all indications were good but as soon as I lifted off it would start doing the toilet bowl thing or fly sideways uncontrollably.  While flying in an open area I would get error messages on the app that GPS was lost, wifi was lost, low battery, etc. But the controller would show everything normal. Each one of the drones  had slightly different issues and some similar ones. Each one though had an issue of becoming uncontrollable and loss of GPS positioning. Each one had at least one time that pressing the RTH button cause the drone to fly off at a high rate of speed even though the controller was set on low. One time the drone finally recovered itself and another it flew into tree branches. One time I took the drone up to 52 feet indicated on the controller but the app showed 120+ feet. The app seemed to be more accurate that time. Another time the app was flashing low battery but the controller showed 2/3 battery level and I think the controller was more accurate. Holy Stone tech support was very good to a point until they started asking for edited videos and various different flying locations and other things that I had already done. I never got a response when I asked about the app or the availability of a different compatible app. On Google Play Store the app does not rate very high but it is the one you are instructed to use.

320,5.0,"Enjoyable drone. Follow the user manual and you will be fine, this is a must.","It’s a good drone due to its stability. It is aggressive in high speed mode which is cool but I prefer to be higher than the trees so I don’t hit anymore at a high speed. I took it for initial flight at the park in an open space, it was great. Took it to my backyard once I was comfortable and to my now ease of mind I was able to control this and didn’t hit anything. My backyard isn’t exactly open but there is space to fly so I will say it’s easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. DO NOT FLY IF YOU HAVE UNDER SIX SATELLITES! Can’t stress that enough, the GPS is a hypothetical leash for the drone. Without GPS it’s comparable to a dog that frequently to runs away without a leash, if you take that risk you’re bound lose it. Aside from that the only negative is the charge time it takes for a full charge is 5 hours but for the amount of money I paid for it, I can easily make room for something else in my life to complain about.

I went on a trip to mexico to a very isolated area and wanted to get some drone shots while i was there, this was meant for my nephew to fly while i used the mini 2. A little background from me, i build fpv racing drones, as well as long range gps drones that are programmed to come back to the lift off location if connection is lost to the transmitter. The mini 2 does this well.<br /><br />I took it for a test flight today, i flew it for about 2 minute. The drone hovered fine, responded to stick commands a little sluggishly, but otherwise fine. I took it to to 30 meters and flew it over an empty soccer field. As soon as i got past the goal on the side it began to break up a bit (keep in mind that this drone claims 500 meter fpv feed), i kept going to 150 meters and all of a sudden i lost ALL signal. In my mind at this ppint i was only dissapointed at the range but that was it, i believed it would return to me so long as i pulled the stick back as i had flown in a straight line. Little did i know the drone would completely freak out and bank right and dissapear into trees and shrubbery never to be seen again. Please understand that i had line of sight of the drone and tried to bank the other way but it did not reapond to any command, after the crash it seems the battery slipped out as i was never able to reestablish a connection to try and ger an idea of where it went.

348,5.0,Very impressive drone,"[[VIDEOID:42e2029623ccf0c810ae3f6e86163ecf]] @ 3 bills for this drone, I'm quite impressed with it.  It's feature rich and has some features you don't see on drones double the price.  It doesn't have a 2 or 3 directional gimble so you need to turn the front of the drone towards the area you want to record and or take a photo.  However, I'm VERY impressed with the quality of the videos. I've included a pic and a video.  The pic was taken from 285' in the air and the video I've included shows how smooth the video can be. Some of the jerkiness of the recording is me getting familiar with the drone controls.  Take off and landings are literally a button press, I like using the take off/Land button. I like when the battery gets low the drone comes back to the location ""home"" it took off from or you can do this by a press of a button.  I see this feature as a safety net on your investment,  who wants to loose a $300 drone in the trees.  I say this because I flew it over a local lake and got it lost above the trees at about 350'. I pressed the home button and whala it showed up right over me.  I received 2 batteries with the purchase and each one has flown +23 minutes each time.  They advertise 26 minutes,  I tried that once and did get the 26 minutes.  It's easy to fly,  app is good.<br />Drone also has follow me and Object of interest feature where it will circle a selected object and take a horizontal 360 degree image.

350,5.0,Nice Drone and Holystone stands behind their products,"So I would have given the drone 4-5 stars regardless, but I'm giving it 5 due to how Holystone handled an issue with it.  Been flying for about 3 weeks with it, not my first drone but I'm not ready to enter any drone races either.  I took it out this morning and something crazy happened.  After weeks of flying with no issues, the drone began to bank left when I was steering right (and no, it wasn't flying toward me).  I let go of the joysticks immediately as that usually stops it, but this time it kept going and BAM, right into a tree.  I was pretty bummed when I walked over and saw the broken arm on the drone.  Contacted Holystone through chat and after a bunch of questions, they honored their warranty and took care of me.  I'm glad to see that Holystone stands behind their products.  Still nervous as I'm not sure why it lost control, but happy that Holystone took care of it!<br />The drone itself has been a blast.  Picture quality is very good, stability on the video is also quite good for the  price point.  The drone is responsive and flies well even in mild breezes.  The return to home usually hits within about 3 feet of takeoff which is quite good.  GPS acquisition takes a minute or so, but you just have to be patient.  Calibration can be a bit of a pain, just ensure you wait  until you have GPS before calibrating, I don't think it will calibrate otherwise but will still go into calibration mode making you wonder why it's not calibrating.<br /><br />Things that could be improved - Battery starts indicating low at 2 out of 4 bars.  I still get about 16-20 minutes of flight time on each battery,  Just wish it would get down to 1 bar as I never really know where I am with it once it's on 2 bars.<br />Batteries also take quite a while to charge, but you get a decent flight time which is nice.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEL3RSLVO4QV5PKJ74UZQQ44USAQ,1659624381599,0,True

Once I got the hang of the controls---and that required at least a dozen or more flights---I was enthralled with the machine's performance.  I watched it stand up to some stout breezes (10-15 mph), perform flawlessly most of the tasks it's programmed for (the tap feature for flying to designated points on a map never worked for me at all), and amaze me by returning to base after being out of sight and hearing for some long, anxious minutes.  I registered 30 or more successful flights, half of these over coastal areas where I live before she inexplicably vanished one day roughly 200 yards off the beach.  Never saw her go down and never will know what happened.  But for a starter drone for someone not inclined to fly over water, this drone cannot be beat.  It is sturdy, can take a beating, and is a pure joy to fly.  I'd give it 5 stars if the transmitter had a hood to help see the cell phone screen (that's a major, frustrating challenge) and if it the drone carried some kind of wifi booster to enable extended down-range visuals.

I was amazed at how easy it is to pair and calibrate (although I do feel a little silly twirling it like a baton to get the compass set). It is very, very stable, even in a still breeze. Smooth auto take off and landing. The flight time is, so far, about 25 minutes per battery. I like the very bright LED lights on the bottom too, since I fly in the early morning a lot. It cost a little more than the Ruko F11 which I had before this but the extra $$ is worth the money. This is SO much more stable than the Ruko. It's better than a Mavic Mini because you also get all of the stuff that comes with the combo pack with this drone.

I started looking at high end drone costing $$$ and learning the features I wanted. I came across the Holy Stone HS720e and saw good reviews and a ton of features for the low price compared to other more expensive drones. I got the HS720e delivered quickly and the battery was already charged so I was able to quickly get it up and running. It takes just a little time to get acquainted with the setup/startup and after that it is easy. It flies great and has a very good controller. The only feature I wish it had was the obstacle avoidance but it did it would need to have additional sensors which would drive the cost higher. So keep the cost down and reasonable and if you crash it its not so bad of a loss I suppose.

Setup instructions are easy to follow and there are video tutorials online if needed. Everything worked on the first try. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that the side-by-side battery connector on the charger could have been made to more securely grip the batteries. It's not hard to inadvertently unseat the batteries from the little press-on connector. Remote control works well although the smart phone clip seems a little weak. Time will tell how it holds up.

As expected, Holy Stone customer service was all over it. Timely and consistent communication until the problem was fixed via an update to the app only about a week later.

After a few more mishaps I decided to buy a cheap little drone that I could practice with inside the house.  This went much better and soon I had enough confidence to go back to the HS720E.  I'd say it's a very easy drone to fly if you've flown one before.  It's very stable even in mildly strong wind and takes great pictures.

It sat for a few months and then I decided to take it for a flight. I found the batteries had swelled up. There was no way I could get the battery out of the drone - even with vice grips. Finally,  I took my HS720E on a flight as high as it would go, farther than I would have ever felt comfortable. Knowing it was my last flight on the last charge because I would be able to get in the battery out, I flew it high until the battery ran out.  It came crashing down to my driveway. My return to home crash talent was pretty good.. It was not a soft landing though. Goodbye HS720E. I loved it but will not buy another. It just does not seem durable.

So far very impressed with both the drone and the customer service.  This is my second Holy Stone drone.  The first was the entry level HS200.  That drone was a great drone to learn basic flight dynamics.  I've crashed that thing many times and it still flies perfectly.

447,5.0,Very Stable & A Lot of Fun to Fly - Acts Like a Much More Expensive Drone,"[[VIDEOID:d5ba8012348a3c1866fd5799b4758ce9]] I bought this drone for my husband and this is his review.<br /><br />This is the first drone I've tested in the $300+ range and it did not disappoint.  I still have to test all the additional functions available via the smart phone app and I'll come back and update this review once I'm done.<br /><br />PROs:<br />- Includes a nice carrying case that is compact, protective and carries what's needed for the drone.<br />- Propeller arms fold up nicely to make the drone compact for travel and storage.<br />- Clear & concise instructions assist with getting in the air quickly.<br />- Uses a USB-C charging cable with decent output for faster charging, 2800mAh battery provides extended flight time and comes with 2 batteries (I was able to get 20+ minutes out of a battery).<br />- Batteries install and uninstall very easily and there are battery gauges on both the drone and the remote.<br />- Minimal pre-flight requirements (basically calibrate the compass) means getting in the air quickly.<br />- 2 speeds: Low speed is quite slow and is very good for beginners to learn how this drone responds; High speed is rather quick and makes for covering distances quickly.<br />- Has good safety features: 1-button start/stop, Return-to-Home, Automatic RTH (low battery or loss of transmitter or GPS Satellite signal), Emergency Motor Stop, Low Battery Warnings.<br />- GPS mode can be turned on and off.<br />- 4k Camera on a 90-degree gimbal takes photos and video and uses smart phone or microSD up to 128GB (I still need to test this).<br />- 2 modes allows joystick functionality to switch between left and right joysticks for personal preference.<br />- Headless mode (although it appears this is only accessible via the smart phone app as I could not find anyway to engage this via the remote).<br />- Storable phone holder on remote (it was able to hold my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra with a bulky case).<br />- Optical Flow Positioning allows for safe use indoors or when GPS is unavailable.<br />- Several advanced features via the smart phone app (Headless Mode, Follow Me, Point of Interest Circling, & TapFly (waypoints)). - I still need to fully test these features.<br /><br />CONs:<br />- Headless mode only available via smart phone app.<br />- Charger can only charge 1 battery at a time.<br />- No trim adjustments that I could find for drift.<br />- Somewhat advanced drone, suggested age 16+.<br /><br />Overall I was very impressed with this drone.  For around $350 you get a drone that has the features and acts like a much more expensive drone, one easily costing $500+.  I feel this drone is a terrific value for someone who is budget conscious but wants an advanced feature-rich drone.<br /><br />Highly recommend - I would buy this drone again at its current price.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGR2PM2CU7EME6R3VR6ZT4ZWNHJA,1601455570496,12,True

453,5.0,"A great drone, with a few minor things you might wanna think of....","I bought this drone as a first drone.  Originally, I wanted to get something from DJI, but, at 600 dollars for a ""beginner"" drone from them, that seemed a bit excessive.  After some exhaustive comparison, I decided to give this drone a try.  I have to say, I'm very happy I went with Holy Stone!  But, maybe THIS drone shouldn't have been my first drone.  There is a learning curve to this thing, and with un-shielded blades, you have to be VERY careful how you fly it.  One nick / bend in a blade and you need to replace the blade(s).  Also, this thing is POWERFUL!!  If you have never flown a drone in your life, you might want to start with something smaller like the HolyStone 210.  I ended up buying this one after a bad crash, and learning to fly it before I tried to fly my 720E again.  It helped!  A LOT!<br /><br />Speaking of that crash, let me take a moment to mention that Holy Stone has great customer service.  After initially leaving a poor review, Holy stone reached out to me directly and offered me a replacement.  Apparently, the first drone i ordered may have been defective.  This new one flies much better!  But, if I'm being honest, it may have also been me and my limited skills at the time.  When I began, I took my time to read the manual / learn the software, etc...  But I didn't understand the need for absolutely clean / undamaged blades, and a lot of other little things that you should know before trying to fly a drone like attitude, pitch, control orientation relation to the nose/tail of the aircraft, etc....  The folks at Holy Stone still offered a replacement.  With DJI, you have to buy ""DJI care"" to get this level of service.  I can't say enough good about this!  Customer service is so rare these days, and these guys take it seriously.<br /><br />If you are a beginner, and after reading this you still want to give this drone a try, one thing you might want to consider are adding prop guards and landing legs to it.  Holy stone sadly does not offer them (hint: they probably should!!), but another vendor on here, HeiyRC, has them available.  Add these to your drone!!  Trust me! Without them on, one small tap/bump can be catastrophic to your drone.  Think of them as your ""drone training wheels.""  They can really save your butt!  Esp if you are flying around trees/indoors/etc..<br /><br />Finally, I wanted to talk about the battery charge time.  Optimal charge time with the OEM battery charger are around 6-7 hours, and they can be done in tandem.  However, there are other sellers on here which sell the individual battery connectors you need to connect these batteries to a rapid charging system that more professional RC folks use for POV drone, etc.. You tube has a video about it.  It can take your charging time safely down to 1-2 hours in tandem.  It will be my next upgrade for this aircraft.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AENPLMH53E5PB7AMXHXTXXRZWLPQ,1642384492853,1,True

There is also lots of good reviews on Amazon too. Please read the whole review.<br /><br />That said, here's what happened with mine.<br />I could send it out a short distance and it would become unresponsive to input from the sticks.<br />It wouldn't fly right or forward for instance, but it would do the GPS return to home. Sort of. Once it got to it's landing coordinate it would start flying in a wild oval pattern. I couldn't get it to respond, so I tried the auto land feature. It took off, banked right and eventually landed, tumbling in the grass. That was the nice crash. The initial crash flew into a tree and broke the camera gears loose. Another of this same issue had it skipping across a parking lot and into the side of a building.<br /><br />Holy Stone customer service replaced it after I turned in some video showing the issue.<br />The replacement became unresponsive also, so while it was hovering, I hit the auto land. It took off again and hit a tree about a hundred yards away. This time an arm was broken. I sent it back for refund.<br /><br />It's kind of interesting that the orbit and follow features worked. I never tried the waypoint feature.<br /><br />Holy Stone customer service was very good to work with and I appreciate that they tried to resolve the problem with a replacement. Maybe there has just been a bad batch of electronics get through to customers. With all the 4-5 star reviews mine must've been an oddity.

That's about it.<br /><br />The bad<br />I went through two, first one just stopped working mid flight and came straight down. Was not too high so did no physical damage but over of the motor died.<br />Went you the vendor and they sent me a new one after i sent a video. This one,It's got a mind of its own.... As others have stated the drone has a massive navigation problem, you press return to home and it just decided to take off in a random direction at full speed and right into a tree. It was like me watching the thing go into a tree and none of my controls would do anything. I'm not new to flying and fell i have enough experience to control this without any issue but this one is just a weird one.<br />The software tried to mimic Dji and does a decent job but it's not worth the savings when in reality it will cost you more and have nothing to use as it'll be damaged/lost within first few flights.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEIAEQ5UQECRWTPKHVEQMEGHAVIA,1618458792976,0,False

478,5.0,Nice entry+ drone.,"This is my first drone. I found it very intimidating at first just because it was. Setup is good and if you follow some YT videos and read the manual it's not too bad. You will need your ""smart phone"" to fly this, but if you're into bigger/better you could figure out how to use your tablet which would give you a bigger viewing area. :)<br /><br />Using the app to fly the drone is fairly simple. However, a few things are necessary. It ALWAYS defaults to beginner in the settings for flight, so you have to figure that out on your own. Once I did, it didn't limit me to an area I wanted to test. Not a huge area, but larger than 50'. You'll find you have no control left/right etc. but can return to home and back/forward (until you hit the limit again). I have yet to really get comfortable, but being the first drone and flying around my yard with lots of trees, I was very pleased on what I was able to do.<br /><br />The camera is not on a gimbal, but the electronic stabilization does a pretty good job. I don't/didn't fly in big winds so my quality of video was fine. I believe for the $$ it's a darn good above entry level drone. You can become comfortable after learning the joysticks and just have to be mindful of which way is left/right, forward/backward when the drone is facing the opposite direction.<br /><br />It came with an extra set of blades and I was able to get one with an additional set to boot. So far, I haven't needed to replace them, but I'm sure that time will come.<br /><br />Fly safe and follow protocols.

482,5.0,So Far So Phenomenal!,"I flew my HS720E for the first time today - Wow!  I did wait a couple of weeks since receiving it for ideal calm and dry conditions for my first flight. That gave me time to familiarize myself with the instructions, controls, and app before flying. I recommend everyone do this because there are a lot of features. Every component of the system from the drone itself to the provided case has a quality feel.<br /><br />I have purchased and flown dozens of RC heli/quadcopters but this drone is a whole new world.  Even under dead calm conditions the others were just never very stable. The HS720E is rock steady. I took off from and landed on a 6'x6' cardboard pad about 30' from any obstacles. The Return To Home (RTH) function did amazingly well at consistently landing gently within several feet of the takeoff spot. This gave me confidence to take it up to about 150' knowing that if I got in a jam the RTH button worked incredibly well. I took some photos and videos which look awesome previewed on my phone.<br /><br />One minor complaint has to do with connecting the batteries to the charger, especially doing this with a LIPO safety bag. Small tabs on the charger align the battery and one of them was broken.  Holy Stone did responded quickly with a replacement.<br /><br />The HS720E is well made, has great customer support, and is a blast to fly! I plan on updating my impressions after more fun flying time.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEJLFUI32TIOVGXYUUGMU3WSJ6HA,1604796366401,1,True

484,3.0,It's an OK drone not worth the $300 plus Holy Stone has it listed.,"Updated 2/20/2021<br />This review is based on the 2nd HS720E Holy Stone sent me as a replacement due to some issues with the first one.  After flying and using the replacement for 2 weeks this is my honest review.<br /><br />I'm not new to flying drones or radio controlled helicopters, but not an expert by any means.  I have to say the Holy Stone HS720E is not bad to fly but not great either.  If you've never flown with a first person view it is a game changer.  The instructions could have been a little more detailed providing a step-by-step before you launch.  Thank goodness for Youtube, I was able to clarify some details not outlined in the manual.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Build quality is pretty solid.  I don't feel like I'm handling a cheap toy, even the remote feels solid.<br /><br />Launching and landing is very simple with the press of a button.  Hovering is somewhat stable in light winds up to 10mph so far.  The highest I took the drone was around 250ft and a distance of 700ft but didn't push it since I don't trust it to not fly away.  (More detail below about this comment)<br /><br />Initially, I felt like the drone wasn't very responsive until I realized I was in Tripod(slow) mode.  Once I changed it to ""fast"", response was much improved.  Again, the manual wasn't very clear about that and had to figure it out on my own.  I'm very pleased I can order some spare parts (props, arms, batteries) on Amazon in the event I need these items.<br /><br />Kit comes with 2 batteries, a charging dock, nice case, and spare props.<br /><br />The LED spot lights under the drone and led lights under the arms are nice for night flights.<br /><br />Drone operation is fairly smooth and quiet considering the price point.<br /><br />Now for the Cons:<br />Very slow charging considering todays charging technology.<br /><br />Camera quality isn't bad but it's not great either at the advertised 4k.<br /><br />Battery indicator on the battery, app, or remote doesn't indicate the battery percentage correctly.  It'll show you have 2 bars left which means 50%.  Wrong I got a low battery warning with 2 bars remaining.  When I check the battery with my lipo tester, it had 20% left.<br /><br />Height and distance on the controller doesn't match what it shows on the app, not even close.<br /><br />My drone has a vibration when it's hovering.  I can see one arm vibrating as if a blade is out of balance.  I can try replacing the props to see if this resolves the problem.<br /><br />My 2nd flight I performed the single button take off which is suppose to go to a 5ft hover.  In this instance It literally just kept climbing and wanted to fly away. Even when I tried to make it descend it kept rising. At some point I was finally able to get it to come back towards me and land.  I went through the normal calibration procedure and had 16 satellites locked in when this happened.<br /><br />The same flight I took it out to 700ft in distance and the video started getting choppy at the 450ft mark and completely froze at the 550 to 600ft mark.  By the time I realized the video feed had dropped, the drone had reached 700ft.  I started walking towards the drone and luckily it was still within visual line of sight so I was able to fly it back.  Once I got within 500ft the video was re-established.<br /><br />My HS720E will not maintain a stable hover regardless of the altitude and no wind.  Even with GPS locked into 16 satellites, compass calibration, and gyro calibration it continuously drifted left, right, forward, backward which requires constant input to keep it steady.  The constant drifting makes it difficult to really capture video or still pics of a subject your trying to capture.<br /><br />It's unfortunate because my first hs720e didn't have these issues.  I actually felt confident flying the first one passed 700ft.  Not so much with the replacement.  The only problem I had with the first one was an issue flying passed the 656ft distance.<br /><br />I reported these issues to Holy Stone CS and their response was as follows:<br />1. Reinstall OPHELIA GO<br />2. Turn on airplane mode<br />3. Turn on the drone and the WIFI<br />4. Connect to Holy Stone WIFI and go to the application<br />5. Make sure to turn off the beginner mode<br />6. Go to parameter settings adjust the maximum distance to 999<br />7. Same issue, kindly send us a video on how you operated it.<br />8. Make sure to fly this one to an open field away from obstructions and good weather condition.<br /><br />I did all these things except send them a video.  I don't have anyone I can ask to video me while flying the drone.<br />- Since then I haven't had the issue of the drone flying away when hitting the takeoff button.<br />- I still have the hovering and drifting issues with the drone 10 to 20 ft away and less than 50ft up.<br />I can honestly say I still don't trust flying this drone for any real distance over houses or trees out of fear it will fly away or fall out of the sky.  Maybe in time but for now I'm being very cautious.<br /><br />Until Holy Stone gets their quality assurance together I can't really recommend this drone.  Unless you don't plan on flying any higher than 200ft up and 300ft out, and don't really care about video and picture quality that much than go for it.  Just be careful how far you fly and go to an open area.<br />Don't let the marketing features like follow me, point of interest, and tap to fly convince you because at the end of the day reliability is more important.  Those features are fun but doesn't mean much if you have quality issues.<br /><br />If you're serious about getting into entry level arial photography or pics, get a DJI mini 2.  Yes the DJI Mini 2 is more expensive but it is an amazing drone with an amazing camera along with very solid flight characteristics.  My DJI Mini 2 will sit at a very solid hover in 20mph winds with 30mph wind gusts.  I know because I've taken video in these conditions from 250ft up and 2600ft out.  No question about losing my DJI, no dropping the video feed, no drifting, no vibrating, intelligent batteries, much faster charging.  Just smooth crisp video and pics.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGXZVJ3XK2NCOTBZ5G5A7SHCA64Q,1609251541937,1,True

Drones less than 200 dollars are unstable and have a hard time flying even in light winds. The Holy Stone is a strong and dependable drone that does what it says it will do. When flying I feel in control ,because it always responds very well. One of the nicest thing about the drone is that I never lose video feed when I'm in range of the drone. The return to home works extremely well and this gives me confidence to push the limits when I want. The camera is fair, but for the money I'm very happy with the electronic stability. See the video. Overall this drone can give you a real quality experience and prepare you for the much more expensive drones that are double the price.

I kept crashing it because I couldn't keep pressing the throttle all the time. I thought I wasn't smart enough for this hobby. But, I have been checking out drones at different price ranges and options ever since. I am retired and on a budget, so I need the best one I can get for the money I have to spend. Also, being an old guy, I thought this would be the perfect way to keep my brain challenged. Playing Solitaire can get boring.<br /> I chose the Holy Stone HS720E because of all the reviews I have read and videos I have watched on YouTube. It made it the Logical choice for a drone under $300.<br /> After receiving it and reading the instruction manual thoroughly, I flew it using up both batteries, and noticed a couple of issues. So I emailed Holy Stone on a Sunday explaining the problems, hoping to get an answer back someday. And nowadays... wondering if I would get an answer at all. To my surprise and amazement, I received an answer that day with a checklist to solve my problems. Which it did. Thank you Holy Stone for restoring my faith in the human spirit.<br /> I am sure I will enjoy many hours of flying, taking pictures and videos with my HS720E.

529,5.0,Well made and easy to operate,"I have about 4 hours of flying time. I am a complete novice. The first thing I liked about Holy Stone's 720Eis was the quality of the drone and associated materials. Really appears solidly made. The transmitter operates with two 1.5 AA batteries !  I like the fact you can recharge the flight battery via USB BUT it does take 5 hours per.  I am in a near suburb of Chicago so my range is limited to about 300 yards distance but at that range I cant see the drone anyway which brings me to a REAL good reason to own it, auto return to home. I thought I had lost it, no visual, no sound and the picture dropped out BUT, a minute or two later it showed up over my head. Whew ! was I relieved !<br /><br />It is extremely stable. I was in 30 MPH gusts today and you would never know it as it hovered about 100 feet up. I decided not to tempt fate however and landed soon after. The FPV picture is also very very stable with the EIS feature, no rocking at all. One minor issue is I lose the video at about 300 yards which is not a show stopper as long as RTH is properly engaged.  Battery life is more than adequate, I'm getting about 30 minutes per flight. I suggest Holy Stone work on the FPV software as it would add to the flight experience to be totally immersed in the flying process instead of watching on your phone. Other than that its a great  product and I highly recommend it !<br /><br />All in all a great first drone for the enthusiast.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFL37H3YJ5NW4WWJWVVVERWU7K7Q,1604005853834,1,True

538,5.0,So far so good!,"This is my first drone. As a kid, I had remote control cars and helicopters, but this is a different beast. Seems to be constructed nicely, comes with a very nice semi-rigid case, app is easy to use and seems to fly fairly stable. I live on an island and we always have around 15+ knot winds, and it seems to handle it pretty well. Since it does not have a mutli-axis camera, the image is a bit tilted when the wind is high since the drone is leaning into the wind. The follow-me and orbit modes work great. I haven't tried the waypoint mode and have been advised to avoid the ""headless mode"".<br /><br />Pros:<br />Seems well built<br />Nice carrying case with room for 3 batteries, my dedicated drone phone, extra batteries for controller, spare parts and the manual.<br />Batteries last 23-25 minutes as advertised -- get multiple though!<br />Large iPhone with case fits in remote control holder<br />User friendly app<br />Lots of fail safe options, great as I get used to flying it<br />4K at 30fps<br />Can review photo/video that is stored on SD card right in the phone app<br /><br />Cons:<br />No multi-axis camera. Makes the video a bit shaky and the image is tilted in high wind. The electronic stabilization works, but not perfect,<br />Remote is fine, basic but fine, except the phone holder. It has a piece you slide up and the it locks in place and a small stand flips out for your phone to rest in. When done, you pull the phone out, flip the stand in and push it back into the remote. This part seems like the only one I worry about with the number of times drone pilots will be removing their phone from the remote. It is just plastic that has a spring clasp, but the plastic feels easy to break if you're not careful.<br />Batteries take FOREVER to charge. From what I read, it charges it at 0.5amps when the 2 cell battery can handle up to 2 amps. This is done to prevent it from charging too fast and deteriorating your battery over time, but at 0.5 amps, it takes over 6 hours to charge just the one battery. It has 2 slots on the charger, but only one battery charges one at a time. This is why you should get those extra batteries!<br /><br />For my first drone, I am very happy. There are better ones, of course, but not at this price point for the features you get. I look forward to flying it and learning more. There is also a great group on FB for HS720E pilots that has been helpful.<br /><br />Happy flying!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NNieG--hL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NNieG--hL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NNieG--hL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHBTCT54VPUTSGEWDFFRPI3SY5ZQ,1610554175475,0,True

542,5.0,Awesome High Quality Drone with 4K Camera!,"This is my 6th different model of Holy Stone drone that I have owned…and by far, THE BEST!  Holy Stone makes a drone for each level of drone pilot out there!  The HS720E drone is their current top of the line drone and is an absolute blast to fly!  My favorite Holy Stone drone prior to this model was the original HS720.  My only ""complaint"" with the original HS720 was the lower resolution camera and ""wobble"" from not having a 3-axis stabilized gimbal. The 4K camera and EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) of the HS720E have solved both of these issues!<br /><br />It comes in a very nice compact case which is perfect for storage and portability!  Setup of the drone is extremely simple…pop in 2 AA batteries (not included) into the remote and slide one of the 2 included modular drone batteries into the drone, and within a few short minutes, you are ready to fly!  The flight time per battery lasts just around 22 minutes. With the drone being sold with 2 batteries doubles your fun at 44 minutes! The batteries come with a dual charger and take approximately 5-7 hours to fully charge via the included a USB-C cable and a standard USB charging block (not included).  Batteries are very easy to swap out by simply pressing on a release button and sliding rearward out of the drone. The new battery slides easily into the battery compartment and clicks firmly into place.<br /><br />To view the FPV camera, you connect to the drone’s 5G WiFi network with your phone or tablet.  Using the Ophelia GO 4K app, you can see the FPV view and access additional features such as:<br />• Access the configuration settings of the drone<br />• Digitally zoom the camera<br />• View the distance & height of the drone<br />• See a map where the drone is in reference to your location through Google Maps<br />• Take pictures/video<br />• Activate Return to Home feature<br />• Activate Follow Me mode<br />• Activate Orbit Flight<br />• Activate Headless Mode<br /><br />The controllability of this drone is phenomenal, making it a blast to fly!  It has 2 speed modes making it easily controllable for a beginner and the more advanced drone pilot alike.  The GPS hold functionality keeps it steady despite considerable winds.  It also has a super bright LED light that can be activated with the right shoulder button on the controller.  This is great if you take your eyes off the drone for a moment and need help locating again it in the sky.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend this drone for those who are looking for a great drone without paying the high prices of other brands!  The great price along with the great quality, fun features make this drone a great choice!  The ABSOLUTELY UNBEATABLE customer service of Holy Stone continues to make me a repeat customer!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEJGUMI6ZNKC3VEON6LDGZG4CLAQ,1601640702276,6,True

545,5.0,Best Drone for both New and Experienced Fliers! This is a MUST HAVE,"The Holy Stone HS720E 4K EIS is AMAZING and I highly recommend it to ANYONE looking for a EASY to fly drone that does not feel like a TOY.  Comes with MANY professional features for under $350. VERY sturdy and super easy to fly (pretty much flies its self if you want).  I bought my son a DJI drone (+$2500) and was terrified to fly it because to what it cost.  The Holy Stone made if very easy for me to learn how to fly and the few times I put it into a tree, it was super resilient and just kept on Goin!.  If I compare the Stone to the DJI I would say that the build quality and the finish and feel are  equal if not better.  You can really notice the build quality when to fold or unfold it.  We have purchased other low cost drone and the are missing many of the features and fell like fragile toys!<br />Another HUGE benefit of the Stone is for about $350 you not only get a feature packed,  well built drone, your get TWO batteries, a GREAT controller, spare parts and a VERY NICELY built case to carry it in.  With the DJI, I had to buy the extra batteries and the case extra and they were NOT cheap.<br />The one and ONLY critique I have for the Holy Stone is that it takes FOREVER for the batteries to charge (5hrs +) and there does not seem to be a fast charger option out right now.  So when you buy yours, you will get 2 batteries with it, I would recommend  getting two more...  On the flip side of that, this drone CONSISTANLY get 25 - 29 minutes of fantastic flight time, with the camera and landing lights on It so nice to have the long flight time, especially when you are just learning how to fly.<br />The video quality is absolutely amazing. the EIS really works and produces  very stable shots, even when in wind and especially for the price point.  We watch these video on our 75"" 4K TV and they are so nice!<br />Now, to be completely fair to DJI, the video shout we get from that are stellar and it can definitely producing higher quality shots in tougher flying conditions, but remember you will drop well over 2K for a DJI and you will get much shorter flight times and many models lack the features you get standard on the Holy Stone like ""Orbit"" and ""Follow me""  If you want to become a professional drone photographer, buy your self a Holy Stone to learn so you can comfortably learn how without risking  a pricy fragile drone like the DJI!<br />Whither it is for your kids, or yourself, I can't recommend  the Holy Stone HS720E 4K EIS enough!  BUY IT!!!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGNBZ3QVFMC3MWFYV2GC3PQHBZAQ,1609559914554,0,True
546,4.0,"USB cable is too short, Charging takes a long time.","The package arrived a day early and contains a very nice travel case, the drone, batteries, power charger, and USB cable.<br /><br />Batteries and charging.<br /> * The batteries take a long time to charge, on the order of 5 hours each and they are charged in sequence.<br /> * The USB cable (Type A -> Type C) is too short for me to plug it into a wall charger and have it reach the table next to the wall outlet to attach to the charging adapter.<br /> * The batteries fall out of the charging connectors way to easily.  The batteries and adaptor need to be on a flat surface to stay  together.<br /><br />Prep:<br /> * The compass calibration procedure could be made to be more clear.  The first step of placing the drone on the ground and rotating it 3 times makes sense.  The 2nd step to pick up the drone so that it is nose pointing up and rotating 3 times doesn't state to rotate the drone around it's front to back access.  After figuring that out, compass calibration was easy.  Note : It's easier to do the compass calibration with the arms folded in.<br />* Setting up an Android phone and pairing it with the drone was easy.<br />Physical attachment of a phone to the controller:<br /> * Using 2 different phones, I have an issue where the spring loaded clip doesn't wrap around the edges of the phone far enough (Case is on the phone, and no, I will not  remove  the case).  Just touching the phone is enough for it to pop  out of its clamp.<br /> * I'm still learning  the app and controller interface.  I was a bit confused by icons shown in the  app startup screen not appearing on the main screen (Unlock comes to mind).  If this is to be done only from the controller, this needs to be more clearly documented.<br /><br />I was able to start the drone and get it to hover.  (First flight?).

553,1.0,Drone suicide via drowning! 😭😱🤬,"TL:DR - good for beginners when it works correctly but malfunctioned more times than worked right, drone death via drowning.<br /><br />The good: easy drone to use for beginners, not a lot of calibrating or technical options that would confuse a novice. The return home and auto land/take off functions are nice. Camera quality is good.<br /><br />The bad: as another review pointed out, the drone would have lose connection many times during flight.  Bought this around Black Friday, took it out for test flights at the park and at the beach, always gave multiple errors during flight but fixed itself in a couple seconds. Product info says it has max altitude of over 394 feet, but it gave error message saying max height reached at 15 meters and would never go higher. Wouldn’t go more than 100 yards away from me.<br /><br />I use a splash drone 3+ for drone fishing, have lots of experience with drones. Used this holy stone drone with iPhone 13 max pro maybe 10x, all testing how well the drone works. Intended to use this drone to scout fishing areas, so was testing how it does in the wind and such.<br /><br />The UGLY: first time flying over the water, used a new  fully charged battery, the drone went 15 feet away from me, 10 feet up in the air, then warning messages indicating no battery popped up and the drone slowly descended into the water. I was unable to go into the water to catch the drone before it hit the water since I was on the side of a cliff.

555,5.0,"This Drone is AMAZING! You will not regret it. Smooth, stabilized videos and easy control","[[VIDEOID:6ae7266823a85cda955470ccf1f598f4]] Wow, I am so glad I bought this drone. I am excited to bring it with me and it is easy to carry with the included case. The extra battery really extends the fun too. I am proud to show off my videos now because of the stabilization. I tried a drone without video stabilization and while it is fun to fly, the video can be a little shaky. This would make a great first drone as the controls are so responsive and you can start in the slower speed to get used to the controls without it getting too far away from you. The optical flow sensors on the bottom were a feature I wanted too as it hovers so good without even touching the controls. The lights on the bottom of the drone are cool too, makes it easier to see in the sky, you can turn those on or off from the easy to hold remote too.  With the 4k 30fps sony camera it makes some outstanding videos too! Search you tube for the model HS720E to find some full resolution videos people have posted as the amazon video doesn't let you do the full resolution.<br /><br />The setup and calibration is super quick and your phone guides you through it after you connect to the drone by wifi and use the app from the manual, ophelia 4k. Auto take off and gps return home make you feel confident to take the drone out a little further and get an eye in the sky! I really like the two speeds too, you can use sport to get you to where you want to shoot and ultra stable tripod mode when you get there all from the remote. The tripod mode will move and rotate the drone to make smooth transitions even when you push the control stick all the way in a direction. I was not expecting that would work so well on a drone at this price, so pleased. The camera can be moved up and down from the remote as well giving you more creative angles. The follow me and orbit modes work well too.<br /><br />The drone also has 60 fps mode where you can capture fast action easier in a little lower resolution or edit it to a slo mo effect video with basic video editing programs. I have only needed the 30fps as everything looks smooth in that mode to me so far, cars driving by or people running look natural and smooth. The E model of this drone adds the extra battery and electronic image stabilization.  I am so happy with this drone!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/28/22: Still loving this drone! So easy to switch between the smooth tripod mode and the faster modes. The altitude and distance limits are easy to set too to keep the drone closer to you when you want.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CM9wjD3ML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CM9wjD3ML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CM9wjD3ML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FYbLMrBnL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FYbLMrBnL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FYbLMrBnL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q3qt4lZwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q3qt4lZwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q3qt4lZwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AF73KPTGWBLVFN5GX2Y4CCJR3Q7A,1600051888637,1,True

571,5.0,Extremely happy with the HS720E!,"Absolutely amazing, no regrets, performs as advertised and as others have reviewed.  This is my first “real” drone.  Because it is so stable, it is super easy to control the drone even as a beginner.  Especially for the price, the EIS 8MB photos and 4K video are excellent.  Battery life for sure exceeds 20 minutes per battery.  The WIFi takes a little long to connect to my iPhone XS, but it always does connect.  Compass Calibration is easy and Auto Takeoff/Landing makes those critical moves a breeze!  The instruction manual is completely thorough.  I’m so excited to take it to more places and use the Orbit and TapFly features.

576,4.0,Better than you'd expect from a budget drone,"If you're used to higher end drones, you're going to notice a few things here<br />- the streamed view to your smartphone is kind of laggy<br />- most of the ""smart drone"" features doesn't really work (e.g. ""follow me"")<br />- the back left knob on the controller doesn't actually do anything<br />- you also need to run through calibration each time you run it<br />- no collision detection, and isn't suitable for indoor use<br />- they could use a better translator<br /><br />That said... its also a fraction of the price of the high end ones. If you want a drone that does 90% of what you need, that comes bundled with all the accessories, that's cheap enough that you don't need to stress about breaking something you can't afford to replace, then you could do a lot worse than this one.<br /><br />Things that work great:<br />- Camera works well enough for a someone familiar with Adobe software to make it look nice<br />- The GPS feature works correctly to keep the drone floating in place<br />- The image stabilization is good enough to get clear footage<br />- The Return to Home feature successfully brings it within a couple feet of its starting location<br />- Looks nice, not cheap - doesn't look like a budget drone<br />- When folded up, the size is only slightly larger than a PlayStation controller","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XqnQ1nWTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XqnQ1nWTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XqnQ1nWTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81af5l1L5xL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81af5l1L5xL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81af5l1L5xL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81esnIWJqHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81esnIWJqHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81esnIWJqHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81oBID5hjAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81oBID5hjAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81oBID5hjAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AH5ZB5C4BYRG2CP6NYY5BNTJLAYQ,1620333006082,0,True

Gave Holy Stone another chance and the second one, after compass calibration and GPS lock on with 13 satellites, would continue to fly left on its own.

587,2.0,Dramatic Quality Control Issues,"I'll start out by saying that I was very excited to try this drone out.  It's specs are impressive and the price point is right on.  The build quality looks top notch and it initially took very impressive video.  The drone hovers in place very well and with the aid of GPS is doesn't drift almost at all.  It was quite solid.<br /><br />Then the problems began.<br /><br />I ordered my drone the last week of November.  I didn't even get a chance to start using it until nearly the end of December.  I was using the drone to take footage of our home being built.  For the first 3 weeks, it returned a solid 9 flights.  Didn't have any issues at all, rock solid and great 4K video.  Then one day I took the drone out to the same place I had the previous 9 times, went through all the same motions of calibrating and such.  Got the drone up in the air and started flying it away from me.  About 20 or 30 feet away, it rotated about 180 degrees and would not allow for rotation with the remote.  The right/left strife were extremely sluggish and lethargic.  I hit Return to Home and it didn't do anything.  Just sat and hovered there.  The only thing it would do is elevate up and down, albiet very slowly.  Since it was over a muddy area I wasn't able to land on the ground and since I couldn't get it to respond to anything else I had it land on my hand.  Held the lock button for 3 seconds to force the propellers to turn off and...nothing.  Would not turn off.  I had to pull the battery out with the rotors spinning. Dangerous.  I checked the drone out and couldn't find any issues.  I then sent it up again and it did the exact same thing again.  Again, I had it land on my hand and took it home to call it a day.  A few days later I took it out again and hoped it was a fluke.  I got the drone up and started moving it away from me and it TOOK OFF wildly out of control, full speed ahead.  I tried to pull up with limited control and it flew into a tree, getting stuck up nearly 40 feet or so in the process.  Eventually got the drone down and contacted customer service.<br /><br />Since I was technically out of my 30 day warranty period by a week or so, customer service initially bucked.  However, after a little correspondence, they agreed to send me a one-time replacement drone as a courtesy.  I was over the moon, as they also just told me to keep the one I had for parts instead of returning it.<br /><br />Fast forward a week later and I take the new drone out to our new home being built.  Get it up in the air and it flys flawlessly.  I'm pretty ecstatic to finally have a working drone again.  No issues with the flight and everything appears to be going well.<br /><br />And then I took it home and popped the SD card into our computer to look at the 4K video.  It looked HORRENDOUS.  The right half of the video was so blurry it looked like something done on a VHS camcorder.  All the way on the far left of the video it was much sharper, although still not as sharp as the last drone was.  I thought maybe I had a smudge on the lens or something so cleaned it off and tried it again.  Nope.  The camera was defective on my replacement drone I was sent.  Just to make sure I wasn't being unrealistic, I put the SD card in the old drone and shot footage holding the drone then did the same with the replacement drone I was sent.  The difference was completely night and day.  My wrecked drone had crystal clear images and the blurry out-of-focus images on the new drone were still just as bad.<br /><br />So once again, I headed back to customer service and told them the drone I was sent had a defective camera.  I was sent through the same generic trouble shooting that involved wiping the lens off and making sure the lighting wasn't too low.  I was told this despite having provided them the CLEARLY obvious differences of the 2 drones videos.<br /><br />Sadly, I was ultimately told that my replacement was a courtesy one-time deal and that they could not help me anymore.  I was completely dumbfounded.  I mean stupefied.  Here is a BRAND NEW drone, and it's trash now.  Holy Stone doesn't apparently have an exchange program or even anywhere to have you send in defective drones for such purposes.  If they can help you, they just send you another one and tell you to keep the old one for parts.  Now, **don't get me wrong here**, as this is very nice of them to offer an additional $300 drone to make it right, but wouldn't it just make more sense to have them FIX the one that's bad?  I don't need a new drone...just need them to look at this one.  This tells me they aren't in the business of making repairable products...just selling more of it.<br /><br />So somehow, after all the dust is settled, I'm left to a $300 hole in my wallet and 2 drones that BOTH aren't able to serve their purpose, neither of which was my fault or doing.  The first one can't get further than 20 or 30 feet from you without turning 180 degrees and becoming unresponsive, and the other has a camera so bad that I might as well just slap a 2004 cell phone on the drone and record a video with that.<br /><br />This product SHOULD get 1 out of 5 stars, but their customer service was willing to help me out the first time, although the replacement was also defective...but i'll give them another star for that reason.<br /><br />This does make we wonder how many of these 5-star reviews actually are for a 5-star product, or just for 5-star service with being sent replacement drones.<br /><br />Look through yourself.  You'll see TONS of reviews mentioning how they were just sent replacement drones.<br /><br />Probably going to just sell both of these 2 defective drones for parts and purchase a DJI like I was considering the first time around.<br /><br />Strongly suggest you do the same.  Quality control issues are highly irritating with this drone.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEBVNGM3UHJUFWKLT4SP7YYYT5QQ,1652451072295,38,True

It didnt hover in one place very well, it would drift. The ""return to home"" feature did not work when losing signal, rather than flying up, it flew left and crashed into a tree. It lost signal in direct line of sight at about 300ft (resulting in said crash).

Not only did they answer, they worked quickly to find a suitable solution for my issue. For customer service I give 5 STARS. I have flown the drone multiple times now. It is not the most stable drone on earth and that’s especially noticeable in a breeze/wind, but on a very calm day (when it’s best to fly drones anyways) this little guy is quite impressive. I would not use this drone for professional work, but it’s absolutely perfect for the recreational flyer and quite easy to learn especially if you’ve flown before.

601,1.0,Should have just bought a DJI,"Pros: Fairly straightforward and cheaper drone.<br /><br />Cons: long charging time for batteries, poor response from controls, miserable customer service, extremely restrictive operating environment per Holystone guidelines.<br />So I bit of explanation needs to be done here. I purchased the drone and it arrived Labor day weekend. Flew perfectly first few times then the problems started. Drone started flying randomly in circles with no controller input. These circles would grow more and more erratic. Sometimes controller inputs would be accepted, many times not. Eventually the drone finally slammed into my truck, damaging the drone and denting my truck door. Called customer support... they asked me to send them a video multiple times of the flight. This video did not exist because I was not recording that flight. After the crash they requested that I do a test flight under what the considered ""proper operating conditions"". These included being at least 100 meters from ANY tree, building, structure, or vehicle. Customer support insisted that these were the only suggested operating conditions for their drones. I pressed them on this and they further clarified that these are the only conditions that their drones were made to operate in. These are unrealistic conditions for most locations that a drone would be useful or good to have, let alone anywhere that you could realistically find.<br />So logically one would think that just operating the drone close to the remote (within 100 feet) would work better, not true per customer support. Those same objects somehow interfere with the signal from the remote? Even a tree that emits no radio frequencies that is substantially further away from the drone than the actively connect controller. Again this is the explanation given by customer support.<br />Finally after multiple calls from support they declared there was nothing more they could do to correct the drone issues and told me to send it back to Amazon for a refund. To sum it all up folks, don't waste your time or money on holystone.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGC3BNKCFXIVSGQZG5GDNLBJLOJQ,1632419316326,3,True

But unfortunately after 2 weeks of use i was out flying for fun and one of the motors gave out mid flight and took a 30ft fall to the ground and busted the drone open and i was no longer able to fly.

604,5.0,Precision Control in Very Compact Drone,"This is my first Holy Stone drone and I'm incredibly impressed by  the way it flies! The low speed setting gives you surgical precision in rotation, and the joysticks operate the drone's movements predictably. For instance, you can move the joysticks just slightly and the drone responds in kind, instead of jolting into action. The high speed setting also feels totally easy to control. The hover is super steady. The controller has just the right amount of buttons, so as not to get confusing. It also holds my phone's rather bulky case fine and at a tilted angle that is comfortable to view. My favorite thing about this drone, aside from being extremely well-made, is how compactly everything fits into the carrying case. Everything you need to fly can be safely tossed into a backpack for hiking, including extra batteries! The manual is actually very thorough and in proper English.

626,1.0,Wanted to love this drone but something is wrong.,"I took the new drone on a quick flight on a sunny day nearly 60 degrees. I flew up and around the yard just fine and so after a short time, I landed it. I figured it was slightly windy so I wouldn't take a chance that day. The next day was to be the same kind of day except with no wind. So the next day I started to fly the drone and that's when things went haywire. Now keep in mind that prior to the flight, I did the gyro calibration and the gps calibration and everything checked out fine. I pressed the takeoff button. It went slowly up to 5 ft but then started flying directly at me and since I was in my driveway to give it a good pad to takeoff and land on, it was close to my house. So, I had to quickly make it go up and from there I could not get control. It flew to the edge of the yard, nearly missing some trees and then around front where it crashed into a line of trees at full speed. Needless to say, it is pretty badly damaged.<br /><br />Holy Stone had been very good with their customer service and I really, really wanted to like this drone. But in the end, there must be something flawed with the drone or the control software. It makes no sense that I do everything correctly and one day it flies just fine but the next it goes haywire. And with 13 satellites (yes, I made sure to note that before the flight), it should not have had these issues. They told me that flying next to the house is not recommended as your phone can try to connect to your home network. My phone did not do that. It was still connected to the drone even after it crashes.  I just wanted my money refunded since this was the replacement drone from the first one that did nearly the same exact thing.

I’ve been watching YouTube videos and trying to figure out how to get the maximum range.  I heard it flies a little further out blindly. It stops recording the video and broadcasting it on your cell phone but when you view the card on the drone itself it will still capture the distance.<br />The distance is a little disappointing and a major setback . I’m hoping it gets fixed somehow I heard it  worked before an update not sure if thats true. I’m going to contact customer service if they explain to me a way to get for the range and I will update the review. But the drone still is a lot of fun and great for beginners . I fly it practically every other day. I didn’t see online you could buy a Wi-Fi extender and give the drone further range .<br />It has a great Stabilizing camera and video with the stabilizer it’s very enjoyable watch. easy to operate  just slide in the battery unfold the drone Calibrateand and  let it launch!  there’s really nothing to it.

While the battery was charging I read the manual and familiarized myself with the controls. When the battery was charged I took the drone outside and got started. I followed step by step from Pairing to One Key Takeoff/ Landing. The drone was in the air in less than 10 minutes. I didn't spend a lot on time in front of my house because I live in a forested area and there are too many trees. After loading the pictures and videos on my computer I was a little disappointed. They were OK but not what I expected. Let me give you a tip. Tade the clear film off the camera lens. Second try, nice. I flew the drone in a field near my house this morning at 7 am and the pictures and videos were good as long as the camera wasn't pointed near the sun. At this price, you will not be disappointed with this drone. PS My videos are too big and I can't download them. I will update this when I can make some shorter videos or find out how I can download the longer ones.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714B7KIZ6vL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714B7KIZ6vL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/714B7KIZ6vL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j-0GAvx+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j-0GAvx+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81j-0GAvx+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pdx-tP3WL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pdx-tP3WL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pdx-tP3WL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGMXXJHYXIAJ3RO7RXWT7NUHUCRQ,1600097842078,0,True

707,5.0,Camera is biggest improvement over the HS720,"[[VIDEOID:ee66941e9d3a0bdc87f4706a0d1844a6]] I liked my HS720 a lot and was looking to get a second drone and found their new HS720E model.  They biggest improvement over the HS720 model is the quality of the camera (camera angle adjustments are way smoother and the image stabilization works awesome).  The difference in price for the HS720E is worth it.  Below is my original review of the HS720 (which still applies to the HS720E).<br /><br />This drone has exceeded my expectations.  I was originally looking at the Mavic Mini and then ran across this model by Holy Stone.  After further research and actually contacting Holy Stone I gave the HS720 a try.  Sure glad I did.  I spent less on the HS720 and got features the Mavic Mini did not have.  I highly recommend this model as it has a no risk trial period and is packed with nice features for the price point.  The battery charge time may be a bit longer than some desire, however it is at a price point where you can afford additional batteries and get some nice features that a Mavic Mini does not have.  BTW, the Mavic mini does not have a 4K camera and the HS720 takes awesome video and photos.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813kDW-T-2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813kDW-T-2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813kDW-T-2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sc6KNnBDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sc6KNnBDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81sc6KNnBDL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uGAo3ktOL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uGAo3ktOL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81uGAo3ktOL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEZUPFDG73WZ7ZQIW5Y3PTMB65RQ,1599762233669,2,True
708,4.0,"Nice drone, not for beginners, Ophelia App is Horrible","Since I'm not writing a review on the Ophelia GO app, I will only let its poor quality reflect a little bit on this review. However, since the app is crucial for operating the drone to its fullest, I think it's important to mention it here.<br /><br />The drone<br />The HS720E is a pretty good drone, basically at the upper end of the budget drone market. You can easily find much better drones for about $50-100 more. But for the price, it's pretty good value. Plus, when you factor in getting two batteries and the case, controller, etc, it seems like a good deal.<br /><br />That said, I do not recommend this for beginners. I know this for sure, since I've got two daughters, 7 and 10, and they are beginners. They can't fly this thing, not without my close supervision. They can, however, fly the HS210 and the DeeRC D20. Those two are beginner drones. What does that mean? Well, it means if they loose control and fly it into a house or car, it won't cause that much damage. The HS720E, on the other hand, weighs in at more than 500g with the battery. This means if you loose control, this could cause some serious problems. That along with the slight lack of responsiveness (eg, there is some latency when changing directions, speeds, etc and this takes getting used to) makes this a drone that requires some better eye hand coordination and sharper reflexes.<br /><br />You can fly this drone without the mobile app and it's quite fun. In fact, I recommend this, in order to get the hang of it and get a feel for how it flies. Then, after you are comfortable with flying, then try the mobile app. You can more fully enjoy the video and photos after you are comfortable with the drone and its controls.<br /><br />The camera<br />The video and photos are pretty nice. I really like getting way up there and taking aerial shots and collecting cool video. This part of the drone is pretty nice. Can't complain, good quality. The only minor issue is that the camera control is not that smooth. If you activate a change in rotation is seems to move in increments rather than smoothly changing direction. This gives a step-wise feel to things.<br /><br />On to the app<br />IMO, the app is pretty bad. Or the connection between the app and the controller and the drone is pretty bad. I'm running a nice modern mobile device, with Android 10, so I'm pretty sure it's fine. I've flown this drone about a half dozen times, and I have experience three MAJOR problems that cause me some concern:<br /><br />1. The follow me and orbit me functions don't work consistently. I had to keep trying over and over to get them to kinda work. And one time, the follow me function malfunctioned and the drone took off across a field without my control. The drone went down about 100 yards away but I thought it was going to fly off and get lost. The Wi-Fi and GPS were strong throughout this process and the emergency shut-off didn't work.<br /><br />2. The app continuously looses Wi-Fi despite having clear line of sight and only being no more than 100 yards out. I've been flying this in a large park field, so it's possible that surrounding area homes' Wi-Fi are interfering. But then again, I'd imagine HS should have considered this and built in precautions...<br /><br />3. The app defaults to beginner mode over zealously. It seems like every time the drone is unlocked the app resets to beginner mode, despite me changing it and saving the setting. Often, out of the blue, the drone will just stop responding (at about 20 yards out), and I look to the settings and the beginner mode is on again! Why!? I understand this is a safety precaution, but it's actually more dangerous when the app or devices changes without the user knowing it. One time this happened to me, and I almost lost control of the drone.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the app update fixes some of this. I'll keep troubleshooting and hopefully my HS720E experience improves. If I run into too much more trouble, I may have to bite the bullet and try another brand (eg, like DJI).",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEWO6BBC4VEWQXGFXHXP5ZVX5X3Q,1611688726711,3,True

711,5.0,First time drone flyer,"First time drone flyer.<br /><br />I am 43 yrs old and decided to get into drone flying to help document my adventures and help me explore some areas I just cant get to. I explore the mojave desert and wanted to be able to look over hills and fly up to mines to help me decide if it was worth the hike.<br /><br />I was a little nervous about flying a drone for the first time because I knew nothing about them. I knew getting a ""cheap kids toy"" wasnt going to teach me much so I decided to try this one. If you want to learn to fly drones spend the money to buy this one before you spend the money on an advanced model. If you dont want to learn and advance to better drones...just buy the cheap toys they sell.  If you are an experienced drone flyer who knows alot about drones, this drone is probably not for you. It is far from a professional drone.<br /><br />I wanted a few things from my first drone. I wanted to fly high and far.  I wanted to fly so far that I couldnt see the drone in eye sight and still be able to fly and come home without problems.<br /><br />This drone has proved itself in that area. However I must tell you this...I got this drone to about 2500 ft away and the signal started to cut in and out even though there were no obstructions between me and the drone. Not a big deal since I am using this drone to learn. Also, when the drone was not ""insight"" of the controler I lost control. Whuch means going around hills in little canyons and such didnt work well.<br /><br />Also, this drone will fly decent in light wind but the higher you go, the further you go...if the wind picks up you may have a problem.<br /><br />I found this out in the desert where the wind can pick up instantly. I had a hard time bringing the drone home once the wind started blowing. It struggled and even blew backwards a few times but eventually I got it home.<br /><br />I am happy I got this drone, It is very well built and a great drone to practice with. First time drone flyers, I encourage you to get it. It was a good purchase for me. If you really want to get into drone flying and dont have experience already, I suggest you buy this drone before you drop 2k on a professional model. This is a good drone to practice with and isnt one of those cheap toys you can get to fly around your house to chase your pets. You will get alot of satification out of this drone expecially when you fly high and far from where you are. Its fun.<br /><br />Consider this drone the prerequset class before you take the advanced class. I recommend it.<br /><br />One thing that doesnt impress me is the length of the batteries and how long it takes to charge them.  They dont last long...especially if you are recording. Once the battery on the drone gets to 50% the drone is limited on hight and distance. Just something to think about. If you take this drone out to the middle of nowhere...like I do. Remember, to choose your flight time wisely because once the batteries are dead...your done. And 50% means you are limited on your flight too. There is no quick charge to these batteries either.<br /><br />I am giving this drone 5 stars because for what I wanted, It is doing. I recommend buying this drone if you are new to drone flying like I am.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61f9RnmrZjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61f9RnmrZjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61f9RnmrZjL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vDaY1jn-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vDaY1jn-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vDaY1jn-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGBT3DB7ABXFQ5P4ZDJJYH6GIFEQ,1618621415830,0,True

729,4.0,Good Product,"Overall, I am very happy with the product.  I did quite a bit of research for a budget drone with good camera quality and narrowed it down to they Holystone HS720E.  Product arrived as promised and it was nicely packaged. It was exactly as described.  It's a robust little drone that feels well made and durable.  It does hane quite a few options to learn about for a new drone person and it does quite a lot.  It handles really well and is quite responsive.  I flew it this weekend it some relatively strong winds (13-15mph).  It held it's own and was able to hover in place and even being bounced around in the wind, it shot great quality video that was not shaky at all.  The video quality is exceptional and stable.  Very impressed with that!!  The GPS functions worked flawlessly along with the return to home feature, set the drone down within a foot of where it started from, in the wind.  My only complaint is how long it takes to charge the batteries.  It takes 5-6 hours per battery and  only charges one at time.  I bought an extra battery to have more flying time and glad I did.  In all fairness, I was aware of the lengthy charge time before I purchased it but didn't realize how much fun I was going to have flying it around.  This is the only reason I am not giving this product  5 stars.  I have not had to call customer service on any thing so I can't review their responsiveness.

Switching to SPORT mode resolved that issue.<br />- Circle only circles around the point when you start the mode, if you move, it doesn't continue to circle around the transmitter.  Kinda wish it could do that.<br />- Follow me would keep turning the camera as you moved side to side, that's nice.<br />- Worked well in a strong breeze.<br />- Overall, pretty easy to use.

I received the drone the next day and was super excited to open....when I opened the Amazon box to get to the drone box itself...I noticed one of the round seals the shows the box has not been opened was only stuck to the box on one side as if it had been opened......I Did not have a good feeling to open the nice little case that had the drone and accessories in it..... upon opening up the case I noticed the plastic protecter for the control LCD was not straight and looked like it had been removed .....I removed it .....and there was a small scratch on the LCD..... bummer!!!....next  I removed the drone from the case .... careful not to let the battery fall out because of the little piece of black foam that keeps the battery from going all the way into the drone.....but to my surprise...the battery was all the way in the drone and no black foam any where in the case other than on the extra battery......I powered on the drone and it was almost fully charged?.....my conclusion was ....the box had been opened.....the battery had been charged.....the drone had been flown!!!!! Wait what???? Surely not...I just purchased a used drone????....but it was true.. I forgot to mention the drone was dirty.....ok enough of that.... Good news.... I called up Holy Stone no answer.... I clicked on live chat.... and customer service responded.... I proceeded to tell her that I received the drone in the condition that I mentioned above....they ask for  a few pictures of the drone and controller.... and without hesitation.... she told me she would send me another drone to replace it with... without sending the other one back.... WHAT!!!!!! Did I read this right?? Are you saying there are still companies out there that actually still do this???

764,1.0,"Poor customer service, and not a reliable product","Basically a decent starter drone.  Video and still shots not very good, but not horrible.<br /><br />The biggest problem is Holy stone not standing behind their malfunctioning product.<br /><br />I learned how to fly, got pretty good.  Then for no reason on day it went out of control and crashed.  I picked it up, restarted the take-off procedure.  It took off, hovered about six feet and started to fly right for my face.  I raised it up, and it flew up and away out of sight.  Never to be found.  After the 90 day warranty, so no help from holy stone except a discount on a new one and a 30% refund offered.<br /><br />It never was crashed before this, or got wet.  It totally malfunctioned with no reason.  There was nothing around to cause any interference (farm field).  It is supposed to return to its take-off spot on low battery.  It is also supposed to return to home if it loses connection with the remote.  It did none of these.  It clearly failed, and holy stone was adamantly against sending me replacement.

The next day I did the calibration again, make sure you do both! Charged the batteries overnight and gave it another test flight it was great, held its hover, and ran it through its basic stuff. I am going to attribute the first day to me being in a hurry and not performing a good calibration.

775,5.0,"Good drone, good price, amazing customer service","Positives:<br />+ Incredibly easy to use; no problems for beginners to start flying immediately<br />+ Intuitive App with very good functionality<br />+ Excellent response from Customer Service when I ran into trouble<br />+ Takes great pictures and videos<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- I had a problem with the microSD slot - this does not seem to be a chronic problem with their drones<br />- I wasted a lot of money on cheaper drones before finding this one!<br /><br />My wife bought me this drone for Father’s Day 2021.  I have a brief history with buying cheaper drones, and every time I tried one of those cheaper drones I would spend hours trying to trim them out just to get them to hover in a reliable way.  When I unpacked the HS 720E, I followed the instructions for charging, familiarized myself with the Ophelia GO app, and watched the quick start video on YouTube. When my batteries were charged I started the drone, linked the controller, oriented the drone compass, and pressed the auto take-off button.  The drone launched and hovered at about 1 meter (3 feet) immediately.  I linked the app to the Drone’s WiFi, and was able to see through the drone camera without any problems.  My first test flight was simple and easy, and my first video loaded to my phone in 720p with ease.<br /><br />That’s a pretty normal good review for a drone like this, right?  In spite of what happened next, the story gets better.  After a few weeks of testing the drone, I started using the microSD slot to record in higher definition.  While the videos were very good, when I tried to reinsert the card in the drone, the card would not lock in place.  It was disappointing, but I contacted Holy Stone immediately via email (usa@holystone.com). Within a business day they responded.  I sent them the information they requested, and within 2 business days they approved my warranty claim and sent a new drone, no questions asked.  That’s amazing customer service.  It deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I have scanned a few 1-star reviews.  Lots of people concerned about what appear to be used drones and a lack of control of the drone itself.  As someone who has had a different experience, I wanted to add a few additional comments:<br />1. If you have any concerns about your drone out of the box, take pictures and contact Holy Stone immediately via e-mail.  Include a screen capture of your Amazon shipment confirmation to demonstrate date of purchase.  I cannot imagine anything they are not willing to make right in the first 30 days.<br />2. Regarding drone control, this cannot be stressed enough: get familiar with the Ophelia GO app before you send the drone out on a long distance fly.  Even if you consider yourself a professional drone pilot with a decade of experience, the drone's base settings are controlled from Ophelia GO.  Flying from the controller only when you don't know what the settings are will lead you to multiple failures, some of them probably fatal for the drone.<br />3. Because so much functionality is contained in the Ophelia GO app, don't assume you can fly the drone straight out of the box with only the controller.  Your new drone comes set with ""beginner"" settings that limit its distance and behavior (flight ceiling, circle radius, etc.).  That will frustrate you if you don't reset them.  If you do reset them and send the drone on a long explore, you're likely to find that you don't really know the drone's limits and you may fly it outside of battery range (it's easy to lose track of 20 minutes of enjoyable flying).  Get familiar with the app and how to set up your drone before flying it in an intermediate or advanced way.<br /><br />Other notes for new users:<br />* While you can use the drone with no issues without the Ophelia GO app, what you gain by using the app is a ""next level"" experience of drone flight.  Familiarize yourself with all the settings, including the ""beginner"" setting which prevent the drone from flying away from you while you are learning how to use it.  This drone is smart enough to fly back to you when its batteries are low, but you don't want to accidentally lose it because you sent it 300m away and can't see it anymore.<br />* learn how to fly this drone in a wide open area - no trees, buildings, light poles, etc.  This drone does NOT have any obstacle-avoidance features.<br />* This drone is heavy enough to require FAA registration, but it's only $5 for recreational use, and that's good for 3 years.  See the FAA web site for more details.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEZMW23T4NYE2YBPLZG2LJK3J4KA,1625623364819,0,False

This drone for the cost is good quality of filming and a great one to use for beginners. The parts for the drone are reasonably priced so as a beginner you don’t have to worry to much for replacing blades and what not if you do crash the little guy. I noticed some complaints on here regarding the video quality, but for the cost I find the video to be pretty good. After receiving good customer service we have even recommended this to family<br />Old review: We have had this product since Oct of last year. At first it was great but then when we recently tried to use it outside the direction frozen and wouldn’t let us move it and it rammed right into a small branch and fell. When it fell the arm of one of the blades snapped in half. After calling the company for help all they would do was send us where we could get the part to fix it. Once we got it we got ready to put it on. What a mess!  Everything is solder together so we not only had to buy the part we had to buy extra things just to put it together. And that not easy either.  Pretty much is junk now. Will never buy from them again and recommend many not to buy from them either. Just junk","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712S6nDykUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712S6nDykUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712S6nDykUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sUf0LboHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sUf0LboHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sUf0LboHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GxZsSHHVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GxZsSHHVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GxZsSHHVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81e1IvWAyEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81e1IvWAyEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81e1IvWAyEL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AELHBVRV7ZTZM4WHND2M26JI272A,1619719768561,1,True

The construction was well thought out and it’s really a bargain for the price.  I met a guy once who spent $1000 on his drone and the quality of the videos he got weren’t  even close to this one.  If you read the instructions before you fly the first time, you will save yourself some mishaps during the learning phase.  I love that we can bring it to us and tell it to land and it does it.  We are not as good at this point at that.  In the beginning, I flew it into a couple trees but it survived very well.  Got extra blades with it but haven’t had to use them.  My best advice is that you read the instructions before you fly it the first time.  It will help you avoid the trees.  We’ve been out with it 3 times using two batteries each time and have learned how to fly it pretty well.  We’re both around 70 years old and Technology is not always our friend.

813,4.0,Great flying drone,"This is my first gps drone so I am not an expert. I started with a $50 drone and was able to make mistakes with that one before moving up. The drone feels great, and looks great. The controller feels good and the controls are well placed. My only complaint is the phone holder doesn't work with any decent case, maybe a thin case would work. The camera is smooth but grainy. I'm sure operator error. I have only flown it twice but RTH works well and within a few feet. Instructions are clear and there are plenty of how to videos online. Charging time is a little slow, and it does not allow for over 400' climb from start altitude. That's fine because that's the FAA limit. My concern is that it won't account for terrain in mountainous regions like I am in, I will try and update if I find that answer. Overall I am impressed and will update as I get more flight time.<br /><br />Edit.<br /><br />After researching I found the 4k camera is only 1MP so the photo and video quality are very limited. The app is easy enough to use, the video transmission range is right on parr with advertisement at about 1600'. The fact it limits altitude is annoying when you live in mountainous terrain and want to fly up the mountain side though your are far less than 400' above the ground on the mountain you have reached that from takeoff location. I love everything but the camera and that's a huge reason for purchase. I did have a run in with customer service they were helpful as possible and they followed through answering my questions and replying to my emails. The drone flies great with good control. Battery life is good, charge time is slow though. I did apply and receive the free battery incentive which is a plus. The carring case is very nice but doesn't account for spare batteries and the charger. I would pay considerably more for this drone with a better camera. They are working their way up but that's the only drawback. This is an amazing entry level drone, if holy stone worked on their range(battery + video) camera quality, and some features in the app this would be a competitor with DJI at least on paper. It flies great. It feels great. The camera isn't horrible. And it looks great. Great drone. This is my honest opinion.<br />Side note Yahoo wouldn't send to their email only Gmail would.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Oy9v3TbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Oy9v3TbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719Oy9v3TbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TxmOYJZwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TxmOYJZwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TxmOYJZwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bogvZZHHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bogvZZHHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bogvZZHHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eS37HSpuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eS37HSpuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71eS37HSpuL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nMh55OO0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nMh55OO0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nMh55OO0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o2uncLhiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o2uncLhiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o2uncLhiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+TZxVDisL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+TZxVDisL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+TZxVDisL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGJMNGCQYGYPZPC7HSHTHGAQVYOA,1604809985334,3,True

I got the drone and the camera must not have been properly set up in the factory during initial assembly or something, some molex connector was not properly seated in the mobo. I contacted customer service which was a little annoying. They didnt read my notes and would ask me to try and do things that I had already detailed that I had done. Several time in a row. Then I was asked to record myself on video going through the same steps again. This is where I was fed up with things. They later explained that the video was not for proof that I wasnt trying to cheat them or something but so that it could be reviewed and used for training because the kind of problem I was having they had not encounted before. They did set me up with an entirly new drone, which was to be a gift for my father in the first place. The drone itself is amazing. It flys great the camera which is a 4k camera by Sony is amazing, the image stabalizing feature works great. when you hit the button for it to return it comes straight back and lands with in inches of where it took off from. I havent seen the other features tested my self like the follow me option. The App for the phone I have seen used and have used it myself a little in testing and it works great as well. it works naturally with the remote, the design and function was well thought out. I would consider getting another drone from Holy stone and keeping it for myself if this is the kind of function I can expect from their products. Id go five star but I was really annoyed with the back and forth on of the customer service part of things with the first drone. The second one is amazing though. The drone itself is five stars for the price range all day long.

I contacted customer support and spoke with Kris. I explained the problem and I was advised to send a short video of the drone including the controller showing that the camera was not working. I submitted the video and a day or two later I received an email  from Dennis, another representative. He stated that he was responding for Kris and had reviewed the video. He also stated that he had requested a one-time exception to their main office and it was approved and I would receive a new drone. I was then asked to provide my mailing address. I feel that the customer support representatives at Holy Stone went well above my expectations. No hassles, no sweat, just professional and friendly service. The HS720e is not their top of their line drone but that is the one I wanted and enjoy it immensely. Without hesitation, when it's time to upgrade or buy another drone,  it will be from Holy Stone.

828,5.0,"Great drone, easy to lesrn","My daughter got me this drone for Christmas and it was a dream to learn. I have an RC airplane that I still haven’t mastered but this drone was easy. I read through the manual and on my first try I crashed into the house! This drone is surprisingly sturdy! A couple of scratches but all is good. On my second try I was able to fly around the house, video my son in law in his garage and basically have a great flight. Since then I have had it out into the park, flown over the property we own and pretty much had a good time flying. This drone is fantastic. It was easy to learn, takes great pictures and videos. The follow me function is outstanding, the fact that it will fly back to the spot it took off from if you lose control is truly a life saver. Admittedly I have crashed it a few times and other than a couple of scratches the drone is undamaged. It is surprisingly tough and I would definitely recommend this drone to anyone who is looking to get a great drone with incredible features that takes awesome videos!

834,4.0,"It a decent drone, very good for the price","The was my first drone. While I ultimately returned it, I think it is a good product I would recommend it for the right person/budget.<br /><br />The good: I was happy with the photo/video experience for the price point.  This was the core separator feature that made my select the 720E. I did not want to go too deep in -- but wanted to be able to get quality photo/video. Overall, was happy with the photo/video experience for the money spent.<br /><br />Flight: I had a mix experiences.  Immediately, I had issues with the drone failing to respond to simple rotate-L/R commands. That part was consistently in consistent at first -- meanwhile up and down worked 100% of the time with forward and back in the 85% range. Eventually I linked with support. They tried --- some of their suggestion were zero-gainers... like try w/o using the phone.  I was convinced it was an issue with the gyro. The manual did not mention how calibrate (I found that step in a video and in other HS manuals).<br /><br />Once I figured out gyro-calibration, the controller responded as expected. BUT, during my LAST flight I notice turbulent video. It was awful, and when I attempted to re-do gyro calibration, it failed... Thus, convinced that particular drone had an issue. I could have opted for a replacement -- but I chose to go a different direction for a number of reasons.<br /><br />(1) The controller felt like a $5 toy.  I have a $1200 phone that barely fits if I uncase.<br />(2) Control issues above. Maybe I just had a defect, which happens. I found the remediation challenging. There seemed like limited support, covering only the far east time zone.  Dialog felt robotic and a bit off-point. I wasn't sure I wanted to have to deal with that long-term.<br />(3) Minor nit, but ... Great there was a manual,  but not so great it missed gyro-cal and web  had wrong manual.<br />(4) Battery/Charging.  Slow recharge seems common with drone-battery tech, but the HS process is extra slow and the connector solution awkward to use. For the size - the battery flight time is shorter than I care for.<br />(5) Gimbal.  I knew there was one when I purchased, so it is not a knock. And the 720E captured to my satisfaction... when I was not resolving issues. BUT, since it was returning it, the window opened throw in a few more dollars, and get something with a 3-axis gimbal to improve on photo-video shooting. The 720E did fine, I just was OK with more.<br /><br />Other Items of Note<br />- The HS App. Functional speaking, works well enough... wireless connected fine, and I the features worked OK. The UI it takes some getting used to. The indicators are hard to see (in the edge of my Note) and there is no font-size settings.<br />- Battery Experience.  The battery charge rate is dumbed down.  I have not metered, but 5 hours to charge a battery that yields 20 minutes of FT is clearly erroring on safe (good), but wow. You need an army of batteries for extended use. USB-C interface is better, OK. but current gets dumbed down to less than 2A (maybe 0.5) rates. I gather there are reasons (fire hazard?).<br />- FAA - Unlike the DJI app, HS can be lifted off w/o requesting permission in restricted air-space. The drone does go over the 250g mark, so should be registered.<br /><br />Overall<br />I got the drone to have some fun with my son outside! We had fun and it takes good pics/vid with stabilized capturing - 4 stars, but he is not as interested, and it has became more MY drone. I love the case.  While I returned the 720E to step-up the photo/video with a DJI Mini 2 -- I do believe the 720E is a great value, and I do recommend it. Had I not had issues prompting a return or replacement, I would have not considered a up-scaled replacement.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHRIXQZ457UD3COPLRPU4N7T2R6A,1609730840817,0,True

The range on this drone, in virtually any environment, even a big open park is at best 500 feet. And that’s really pushing the limit of its capabilities. In my neighborhood, where there’s houses, it’s cut in half. 250 feet at max, even directly vertical.<br /><br />This really bummed me out because it seems well made for the price otherwise. I like the design, I like the controller, even like the app. The return to home function works well, which is super important. The camera isn’t 3 axis gimbled so if you’re new to droning it might be a learning curve to get the shots you want, but I think it takes quality pictures and videos in 4K as long as you have an sd card onboard.<br /><br />Long story short, everything works well enough for what it is, but the severely limited distance on the WiFi just takes the drone out of the good category. I sadly really can’t recommend buying it because of that. Just save up the extra money and get a DJI mini 2. It’s worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/7/21<br /><br />Holy Stone reached out about this review and offered to send a new drone out. Didn’t even ask me to send the old one back.

It would rotate slowly then stop and the remote would work again. My husband, growing concerned, decided to land and pressed the land button...and nothing happened.

So HS720E is actually my beginner drone, a REAL beginner drone - one that is pretty stable, can go a descent distance, can take a pretty good video, and it does come back when it goes out of range or low battery.<br />The one major recommendation I can make here is to turn the beginner mode off in the Ophelia Go settings.  Initially it was on, and before I figured out this little step, the drone experienced a number of steering problems when it gets to about 50 ft out from you.  Turning it off fixed everything.

We appreciate the great customer service and I would recommend this drone to others looking for a very good entry level drone.<br /><br />We had our holystone drone for only 2 months.

Unfortunately we used the drone for the last time yesterday as it took off immediately after take off and flew extremely fast in the opposite direction leaving us no control of the drone. Sadly, it was never retrieved and we were left with nothing for our hard earned money spent. This was absolutely not user error as many people witnessed what happened.

879,5.0,This Drone is amazing!,"Ready to fly out of the box. It basically flies by itself. The manual is basic, but watch a few videos on you tube and ur ready to go. Very stable, Remote and WIFI range very good. I flew it in 15 mph winds with no problems. The Drone is full proof. Once airborne, plot a course and it flies it. IF it goes out of Remote Range (approx 3000 feet) it will automatically return until it gets a signal again. If the battery is dying, it will return to within 98 feet, until the battery is almost drained, then it will land by itself. Of course flying manually is fun too. It hovers all on its own. Fly it away, if u get confused, just let go of the controls and the drone will hover where it is. Get ur bearings, then start flying again. Still confused, hit the ""Return to Home Button"" (RTH) and it will come home. The only thing is, it does not have obstacle clearance, but you can pre set the RTH altitude that the drone will climb or descend to prior to it leaving its current location and then returning home. Great Drone!! Love it!<br />UPDATE: I have flown this drone half a dozen times. Still loving it, but I learned a few things after emailing the company..<br />1) IF u start the video via the app on your phone and the drone goes out of the drones Wifi range, BUT still in remote range, the video will stop recording. (This was verified by the company) To get around this, use ur remote to start the video even when using the app.<br />2) Max wind is 18mph<br />3) You can not plot a course out of Wifi range...example, the drone is hovering over me, I plot a course using the app to a point 3 miles away. I was hoping the drone will fly toward it at first, but return when it is out of range, BUT the app will not allow u to plot a course so far away.<br />4) The picture/video are amazing....HOWEVER I flew the drone at night and the pictures/video are horrible!! Very disappointing.<br />5) Calibrate the drones compass/gyros on EVERY new location you go to. Do this before the first flight of the day. This will assure it will fly stable and return to home.<br />Now that I have flow this a few times, I do wish it had more range. 3,700 feet distance is just not enough. The Wifi connection is less then that and I wish that too was further. BUT overall I am very pleased.

880,1.0,Doesn't work anymore,"2023 Update :<br /><br />I should have updated this review a year ago. Last year, the drone had intermittent issues with speed. It would go into limp mode and move very slowly. This happens within a few minutes of taking off. Also, we were losing video connection within 250' of unobstructed distance. I'm not sure what's going on, but all our efforts to recalibrate, restart, and use fully charged batteries have not resolved the issues.  This thing has become an ugly paperweight.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Original review:<br /><br />We had an issue when we flew this drone for the first time. For some reason, the manual did not mention (or did not place it where it's easy to find) the Beginner Mode, which is the default setting when purchased new. In Beginner Mode, you can only fly 50' vertical and 50' horizontal from where the drone takes off. I did not know that and thought that the drone was defective. Then, 10 minutes into flight, I was able to go 110' away and the drone took off in some random direction, uncommanded, and crashed.<br /><br />After watching a few YouTube videos, I later learned of the Beginner Mode setting and switched it off that mode. We've never had any problems since.<br /><br />So, I suspect the folks who are rating the product as 1 star are reporting as such due to random uncommanded flight. I believe there is a glitch in the software that momentarily allows the drone to fly past its 50' limit in Beginner Mode, but when it senses that it's outside those limits, it goes haywire. Another setting that may have triggered the glitch may have been the speed setting. I had set the drone to advanced speed setting (button on the controller) while unknowingly be in the Beginner Mode setting (setting through the phone app). This could have been a bad combination.<br /><br />My advice is immediately get off the Beginner Mode. And, if you're in the beginner mode, do not select the high speed setting.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHJFCSIX2GZDOLE7RKJVP66QYQ3A,1642696174592,2,True

It's hard to shoot videos with because the camera moves around with the frame.

909,5.0,"Love It..... well, kinda","UPDATE: After more stick time with the 720E I am not so much a fan. I live in Portland, Oregon and there are very few winter days I can fly. When it’s dry but very cloudy, the drone has difficulty finding satellites. So, GPS flying is out of the question. When it’s a clear day I get about 8 satellites and can use GPS…. well, kinda. We also have lots of very tall trees and I will lose GPS frequently. Not good. But GPS flying is a bit better in an open athletic field; but kinda boring. Also, the 720E tends to have a mind of its own, and frequently drifts as much as 10 feet even when there is no wind. I think this is due to GPS issues.  Also, return to home is not accurate (again, GPS). It is also slow to respond to stick movements, which is kinda scary. But not sure why this is. Yes, I am in Fast Mode. Beginner mode is almost useless. My brother lives in a high desert location. No trees, no heavy clouds; big sky country. He get 12 or more satellites and his HS720 flies great. Hmmm. I bought a DJI Mini 3 and had one learning flight with it. It has good GPS (8-10 satellites) and is very stable and responsive to the sticks. The DJI Fly app is in a different league than the Ophelia Go app. The DJI It was more than double the price of the HS720E. As they say, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />UPDATE: I bought an HS720 for my grandson and it is unable to connect the Ophelia Go app to the drone. Spent several hours on the phone with Holy Stone support but was not able to resolve the problem. The HS720E works fine, but the HS720 does not. Very disappointed. Now I am gun shy about buying another Holy Stone.<br /><br />This is my first drone, and I did a lot of research before deciding to buy the HS720E. Final decision was based on price, camera, GPS and related features, and online YouTube reviews. Plus, a friend of mine who has been flying drones for years gave the HS720E two thumbs up. The HS720E looks and feels sturdy and well made. The battery fits well, and the arms swing into place easily. I really like the small screen on the remote and the folding handles. I used an old cell phone with a 6.1” screen and it fit nicely into the phone holder at the top of the remote and stays in place. Be sure to fold down the foot pad at bottom of phone holder or the phone will not mount properly. Downloading the Ophelia Go App was also easy as was pairing the remote and the phone to the HS720E. Setup was easy and straight forward, but there is no detailed information how to use the App and it is different than what I found online. As a first-time flyer, I found the HS720E to be stable and reasonably responsive. The Take Off and Return to Home function worked extremely well. But it takes some practice getting used to the joy sticks. All in all, my first flight experience went reasonably well. I did have a few low level crashes but there was absolutely no damage. I do have one complaint, the two port battery charger apparently charges one battery at a time. It would be nice if Holy Stone included a two port battery charger that charged both batteries at the same time. But they can be purchased on Amazon for $13-$15. Otherwise, as a first time drone owner, I am very impressed with this drone!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFO4TJ3LSW2C33DA7ZNKURGPZZNA,1679838520291,4,True

911,5.0,Great Drone,"Qualifyer:  My first drone. I attempted to fly RC Helicopter back in the 80's and found it extremely difficult. This drone is beyond easy to fly. I had a good prep by watching all the YouTube videos, particularly the Ophelia Go introduction. I suggest anybody not already familiar to do so.<br /><br />I purchased this model for the enhanced photo/video abilities compared to the previous 720 model. If operated in the slow mode (1) and with the sun overhead or behind the picture video appears very smooth with good color rendition. I'm sure there are better but at this price point this has more than exceeded my expectations and unless you are a Pro you likely would be as pleased with yours. I will also mention how stable this is in the wind, imperative for the video effort.<br /><br />I labeled my drone with my registration # as well as marked my batteries.<br /><br />The build quality seems very good and certainly not built as a toy. I'm impressed that Holy Stone put together a full package of the extra battery, case, and spare props. This is a full kit that anyone would easily contemplate purchasing with any other drone.<br /><br />Customer Service....I needed some simple clarification and reached out to Holy Stone with a reply within the hour and follow up responses in a prompt manner.

913,4.0,"Updated Review, 720E is great now!","[[VIDEOID:d2db09acc72b149c238162c3e85e32f4]] Updated Three day Review<br /><br />11/25/20 Update: The 720E FPV mode is awesome! 720E FPV has minimum lag (within reasonable distance) and takes your drone flying to the next level. What is even better is putting VR googles on my kids while I fly the drone around. Totally fun! Highly recommend trying the 720E with some VR googles, but you MUST have an observer so you don't walk into traffic or crash drone into tree :).<br /><br />Three day review:<br />Foremost, Amazon/Holy Stone honored my replacement and my new 720E performs great.  The below reviews are over a course of 6 days at various locations and covers the operations of two 720E drones:<br /><br />Day 1 - Took the replacement 720E back to the semi-open field in the country about 40 miles away from my home in Class G airspace where my first 720E went rouge. I launched in the exact location and took it up to 100 feet and out to 200 feet and it worked great. It did not fly southwest on its own like the first 720E.<br /><br />Day 2 - Took the replacement 720E by the mountains and lake in Class G airspace about 3 miles from my home about 6 mph winds. Absolutely amazing performance and it held great in the wind! Took it up to 380 feet and was able to get some amazing footage of the lake, ocean, mountains and city. I lowered it to 100 feet and took it to a max distance of 774 feet and when the signal became intermittent, I got a warning, and a few seconds later the return to home function kicked in. When the drone got within 50 feet of me, I was able to override the return to home and go back flying.<br /><br />The return to home function is a must have and it works good on this drone. It gets within 6 feet of its launch point (for me, it always lands to the rear right of it initial launch point for some reason). The first 720E after day 2 of flying did not return to home accurately,  it would land in a completely different location.<br /><br />On both 720E's: Battery life is great. Follow me function works, but a little jittery. Orbit mode works but it is hard to understand how the drone picks its center. Waypoint mode works great. The replacement 720E stops climbing at 380 feet, but the first 720E went pass 400 feet.<br /><br />Day 3 - Did a flight in my neighborhood with the replacement 720E and everything was great. Took the replacement 720E up to 380 feet no issues. Took it up to 383 feet distance at 102 feet height until transmission became intermittent, I was able to work through and bring it back without using the return to home. Everything worked solid. The first 720E on day 3, while at a park, caught another rouge signal and would fly on its own towards people and when i pressed the RTH it would go a different direction than the starting point and the emergency stop did not work. On both drones, the emergency stop takes too long to work. However, at this point I can say my first 720E was defective.<br /><br />Overall Holy Stone did a great job on the 720E drone and you will not be disappointed.  I am giving 4 stars because I had to deal with the hassle of a replacement and the replacement appeared to be a used or factory refurbished model as it had various settings set and there are smears/tiny scratches around lens and optical flow sensor; their instruction manual needs to be more thorough and in proper English (including their website); and the transmitter does not display distance and height in feet only in Meters.<br /><br />My first 720E had a few problems: On day 2 it caught a rouge signal and began flying away on its own. On day 3 of flying, while hovering at 12 feet in sport mode and it did an immediate reverse, almost struck a few people, and crashed into a truck, flipped upside down, and the propellers were still going. The emergency stop DID NOT work/stop the propellers. Turning off the remote did not stop the propellers. I had to physically and dangerously pick up the 720E. I pressed the power button on the drone and it did respond, I had to remove the battery for the drone to shut down.<br /><br />After I reset everything and tried another flight with my first 720E, it crashed on its own. The propellers did stop spinning upon the crash, but when I picked up the 720E, the propellers activated on its own almost causing me injury, even after I hit the power button. I tried the emergency stop and the drone did not respond.  I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DGXz4lHPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DGXz4lHPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DGXz4lHPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ncKshuzAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ncKshuzAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ncKshuzAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zgKCL-0kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zgKCL-0kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81zgKCL-0kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFJKVPEVFARWSUEVYTSXE2DFTCOQ,1605504077571,5,True
914,2.0,"Awesome Flyer, HORRENDOUS Camera","[[VIDEOID:3772781873cdc8b0ef6b24a4d6cbaa79]] This was my first drone as a gift and I was extremely excited about it.  It's great to fly, does a lot of what you would like in a drone.  Circle you, follow you, point to point, etc and flies pretty darn smooth!  So this is good for someone who is new to drones but has the ability to learn new complicated things.  There are 8 axis of motion here to learn, for some may be challenging, but if you go slow and practice it becomes very easy to maneuver.<br /><br />So the problem I have is the camera, take a look at the video.  I sent up the drone with a budget 4k Action Cam I got off Amazon (Victure 4k).  So the drone footage is on the left, the budget cam on the right.  The budget cam is so much clearer and crisper than the Holy Stone camera.  If you just want basic footage and pictures, then it's not a problem, but if you want to make some good videos and edit them, this will leave you unsatisfied.  I think the video speaks for itself.  The footage was shot with the default parameters on the Drone, same as the budget cam.  The photos also give you an idea, they are from the Drone, one is of a distance shot and the other more close range.  For the price, Holy Stone could have added a better camera if a budget action cam can do much better.  The technology is there, why skimp on it?

917,5.0,Possibly the BEST beginner Drone on the Market,"The Holy Stone HS720E 4K EIS Drone is amazing.<br /><br />After researching allot of Drones under $300 it was very difficult to find another Drone that offered all the features of the HS 720E at this price point and the HS 720E has more features than Drones costing twice as much. The EIS Camera is excellent and with all the recording options available 4K, 1080p, frame speeds, and high bit rate capture, the HS 720E may just be the BEST Drone available in this price range.<br /><br />This is my 1st Drone and with the great instructions, the ease of flying this Drone makes it the perfect choice for anyone who wants to learn the fun and excitement of Drones without breaking the bank! Not sure you can find a better value for the money than the HS 720E?<br /><br />I was able to land the HS720E in my hand within a hour of my 1st flight time. I know that's not recommended but this Drone is so stable, sensitive, and easy to position it wasn't even really a challenge. I like that. The return to home feature is excellent and this Drone lands on the landing pad almost all the time.<br /><br />Picture and video quality is exceptional and rivals that of drones costing 2x the price.<br />There's so many features included in the HS 720E that it would take me quite a while to list them all so check out Captain Drone's review of the HS 720E on Utube and you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />The Holy Stone 720E is so much fun to fly and capture pics and video with, that I now have another life long hobby that provides hours of enjoyment. The ""Fun Factor"" with the HS 720E is off the charts.<br />I've used the ""Follow Me"" function in many various outdoor activities, Hunting, Fishing, Motorcycle riding, Camping, Hiking, etc., that it's made the ""Don't Leave Home Without It"" list!! ;-><br />Great Value for Price and HS's customer service is as good as it gets.<br /><br />What more can you ask for in a high quality, well built, feature loaded Drone that's under $300 and that includes an extra battery for a total of 46 minutes of flight time!

The stabilized video is far better than I expected for such a value priced drone.  It flies easily in moderate wind although the video quality suffers as would happen with most drones.  It is easy to fly with single button takeoff and landing, GPS enabled, and has headless mode.<br /><br />What I don't like is the battery takes forever to charge.  If you only have one battery I suggest getting another as it lasts about 20 minutes but takes 5 hours to recharge.  I also don't like that there is no visual aid to tell you when to stop spinning it when its calibrating.  The smaller HS drone I had stopped the marker lights blinker when each axis was set.  Not horrible but could be improved.<br /><br />To summarize this is a great drone at a great value point.  The biggest issue is the painfully slow charging.  It flies great and is easy due to the GPS function.  The video stabilization works better than a lot of more expensive drones.

942,1.0,Three strikes and you're out,"I bought this drone as an entry point to the hobby. When it works it works ok. The 4k image is blurry and the colors are pretty washed out, but I wasn't expecting amazing images from a $300 device. When things go wrong, however, they go really wrong.<br /><br />Strike 1: This spring I took it out to get some shots around the beach, taking off from a front yard. After reaching about 10 feet in the air with minimal wind it decided it wanted to go on its own adventure, taking off horizontally with no direction input from the controller. Luckily I was able to control the altitude of the drone and brought it crashing into a bush to keep it from going into the neighbor's property.<br /><br />Strike 2: In the summer I had it up high to get some fun firework shots from a distance. Everything was working fine until I received a notification that my battery was getting low. About 5 seconds after that instead of doing it's safe emergency landing maneuvers the drone instead shut off its motors at 100 feet and came crashing down to the ground. The fall luckily only popped one of the plastic gears for the gimbal loose, but I had to tear pretty deep into the unit to pop it back into place.<br /><br />Strike 3: After performing a full safety and flight check I brought this drone over to my parent's home to show them some cool bird's eye views of their house. As soon as I got it up to about 50 feet with little to no wind it once again decided to take itself on a grand journey away from open space and into a stand of trees about 200 feet away. This time not even the emergency shutoff worked. I had no control over the drone but it was still connected to the controller. The drone eventually lodged itself about 50-60 feet up in a stand of trees overlooking stickerbushes about 4 feet deep. At this point I just had to call it a loss and walk away.<br /><br />Unfortunately with the issues I came across I cannot recommend this drone due to the high potential hazard to health and safety.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AG2B3IIKVWCWYKXHIS5MDXIFMSWA,1661451780472,8,True

948,5.0,Great drone for the money!!,[[VIDEOID:421841e973f63eb6bdcd549fc46405f8]] I was going to spend a lot more money on one of the bigger well know brands. I glad I didn't. I've only had two flights with this so far and I haven't pushed the limits yet. So far I've only gone about 200 feet in distance and about 180 in height. I love everything about this. The case it comes with is really nice. The drobe itself flys great. I watched a bunch of youtube videos on how to fly this and I haven't had any issues. I woudl really reccomend this as your first drone. I've actually been keeping this my car so that when I drive past a park or a field I have it ready.  On thing I would suggest is to get a memory card and a landing pad. I got both here on amazon. The landing pad will help you to not ruin the blades on landing. You want to make sure your blades are higher than any tall grass.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815LNU3almL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815LNU3almL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815LNU3almL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815LNU3almL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815LNU3almL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/815LNU3almL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dFs84OpcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dFs84OpcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81dFs84OpcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFGTAESVUR4TGLGSXKQ7A4DLV3MQ,1607623809954,0,True

Return home and other controls weren't responsive and unfortunately the HS720E flew into a tree at the edge of the field and then crashed to the ground.  We were frustrated, my son heartbroken.

For my purchase, this would be an understatement. I've not recorded 1 second of footage because no matter how many times I calibrate, find a day with little to no wind, open space, the drone will not hover even tolerably still. From launch it will just slowly tilt and hover away, and by the time I get a chance to test the object is out of frame. Every time I set the follow me mode the drone turns completely out of frame from me locking on to what seems only a direction. It will attempt to follow me but not with the camera. As I've heard before the RTH feature can go berserk. My last straw was when I tried to take off with no response and no other features working then, out of nowhere the drone launches up and tilts fast right into me, cutting my hand and leg up. I will say the image stabilization does look good via the app but pointless if I can't even fly safely. Returning today.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEICSKZDHQ7BMPZ24Z6GTUZROQOQ,1628875746468,0,True

965,5.0,Maybe Faulty drone.,"Update:<br />After contacting customer service, they made it right.I know have a functional drone. It happens to the very best, it was a faulty one. Now I am very happy with this drone.<br /><br />For starters, I’ve handled many drones, this pretty much is a beginner drone...<br /><br />I attempted to pilot this drone 3 times. All three times this drone did not respond well.<br /><br />The first attempt, using auto take-off the drone went performed a U from take off mark and came crashing down top first. Pretty humiliating in front of my son.<br /><br />I turned both the drone and control on and off,  re-calibrated, good signal, 12 sats. 1/3 battery down.<br /><br />2nd attempt, I decided to manually lift off, drone went up, only up. Would not rotate, or move to any direction. It went up and down only. I started to worry about drones behavior, so I pressed RTH, the drone started to come straight down at a steady pace from about 50ft...then about 15 feet from the grownd, the drone just free-fell and the controller started beeping...needless to say the drone crashed to the grass. It was out of juice. Literally 2/3 of remaining battery drained in less than 60 seconds mid air.<br /><br />Third attempt, I plugged in the 2nd battery, and went through the calibration process, 12 sats, clear for takeoff...I attempted the auto take off and the drown literally did another U and came crashing too first again missing the grass and hit the concrete. The propellers were still spinning, the 3-sec lock bottom wasn’t turning it off. Eventually a few seconds later the battery seemed to have drained, the controller stated beeping.<br /><br />That was the end of it....because now the charging hub was weird. Both batteries plugged in hub first then in outlet...the green lights I and II would blink rapidly. The next day....still blinking rapidly.<br /><br />Unplugged the batteries, while the hub still in outlet, plugged batteries back now the green lights I and II blinking slowly....the next day...same slow blinking. Plugged them in the drone, and there was less then 1/3 in each battery couldn’t even finish calibrating :(<br /><br />I’m not new to drones, as I said I have operated plenty, including this particular HS720e. There MUST be something wrong with this drone, and batteries.<br /><br />There are plenty of positive reviews, and I’m sure they are all true and sincere, I wished this review would have been one of the same....but it is not.<br /><br />I have not reached out to customer support yet.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGYQKQEHY4ZX7EIUWZXDZ4ZQYLLQ,1606722957571,0,True
966,4.0,Very nice camera drone for a reasonable price.,This is my 1st drone and I did a lot of research before I bought it. I watched video reviews of many other drones and read almost all reviews. What I wanted was a foldable stable drone that could handle a light breezy day under $300. The smaller drones that do not require FAA registration can't manage much wind. There is a newer version (HS720G) with 2 axis gimbals which may be better but it was not available when I was searching in 2020. Then I lost my drone and needed a replacement so bought another HS720E.<br /> I like how these drones can be stably controlled by GPS and nudged around with the controller to frame the camera views. It is a good starter drone for my needs.<br />  TIP: I had some trouble connecting to the drone but Tech Support guided me to disable my phone connection to my home WiFi and disable Phone data which was interfering. Then it connected fine and flew as expected.<br /> Another consideration with many drones is the FAA requirements for Remote ID by Sept 2023. This drone does not have that feature and I hope Holy Stone or someone will make some option to upgrade these drones soon.,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGM2OLHGF4KXUPAV4R237JSYY6WQ,1673192799737,1,True

The app for the cell phone works well, but could use more clarity. Had to download the operators manual from the Holy Stone website and watch a few UTube videos to answer a few questions. I have only flown the HS720e a few times, but am looking forward to using it frequently for recreational flying.

981,3.0,I wanted to love it,"This was my second attempt with a Holy Stone drone, but  had to return this one too. The first one came damaged, and although Holy Stone customer service was excellent, prompt and responsive, they couldn’t help me because apparently, Amazon is >NOT&lt; an authorized seller, so beware for warranty service.<br />The second drone came in what seemed perfect physical condition, but it was so unstable even in a light breeze, it was unsafe to me and itself. It would suddenly veer to the side. I was able to regain control, but after several incidents, I’m pretty sure it was a connection/software issue. The final straw was when I took the drone up on a fully charged batter when it suddenly gave a low battery warning and went into landing mode. That would have been fine except it shot off towards the wood line and the controller was completely unresponsive. I chased it into the woods and seemed to get intermittent control and ended up being able to land it, although I could feel it fighting me the entire time.<br />It really is a very nice drone. It’s very well built and has features only found on much more expensive drones. The unstable flight and sudden dead battery warning was the nail in the coffin for this drone. Losing all control is very dangerous and at the end of the day, I had to return this drone and go with a popular and much more expensive brand.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AH37PIRJTSY73FGV3AVVYBFNT2UQ,1644496338932,1,True

Reading through the instruction manual and going through the first time calibration process, there were some things that were a bit confusing due to poor wording, and two steps that were different from what the instruction manual described.<br /><br />The real issue, and what caused me to return this drone, is upon initial startup and entering hover mode, the drone started to strafe to the left. I brought it right and when I let go it traveled another 2 feet before coming to a stop. Mind you this is all low speed movement. Once I got it steadied out I began a descent so I could shut down and troubleshoot. During the descent the drone started creeping to the left again and then quickly shot down and right and impacted the ground. From there the rotors failed to shut off for a good 30 seconds after I powered them down.<br /><br />I’m a bit shocked that despite the high reviews, this quadcopter performed so poorly.

1010,1.0,I must have gotten a bad one.,"I have an older HS700 that I've been fairly happy with so I stuck with Holy Stone for my next drone, the HS720E.  The calibration procedure is similar to the HS700 and it only took about 5 minutes from unboxing until it was ready for flight.<br /><br />That's when the problems started.  I could see and connect to the drone's WIFI but the Ophelia app would show ""Not connected"" and there would be no video.  No matter what I tried it was the same, ""Not connected"".  I even tried a different phone.<br /><br />After reading some forums it seems this is common.  Most send the drone back but others suggested using the ""M RC Pro"" app instead.  I installed that app and viola, the drone connected and I could see video!  So, time for the first flight.<br /><br />I started from a wide-open field and touched the one-button takeoff.  It sprung about 6 feet up and hovered, but was listing slightly to the left.  I had to keep moving it back.  I brought it up to about 50 feet and the listing got worse.  There was no wind so I don't know why it wasn't stable.<br /><br />I moved it up another 20 feet and forward about 100 feet and things went haywire.  The listing was so bad that I had to move the joystick to the complete opposite direction to keep it still.  It stopped obeying my commands and would move randomly.  I hit the panic button, return to home, but the drone had no idea where it or I was.  I had 17 GPS references and a strong signal!  It wound up flying out of radio range and accelerating into the ground.<br /><br />I dusted off the HS700 and flew it around without problems.

I've been communicating with them via email, and they always get back to me in 24 hours.<br /><br />I had issues with the range, likely due to too much interference in my area, but they sent me a new controller anyway to see if that would help.

1024,4.0,Nice for the price!,"This is my son's second drone, which is a significant upgrade from the starter drone that wore out years ago.<br /><br />The start up took about 30 minutes but he was in the air in no time. The controls are crisp and response time is good. We had some issues with it glitching out which lead to him having an unfortunate crash and causing quite a bit of damage, I'm not sure what the connection issue is or if was simply an isolated event.<br /><br />At any rate, I spoke with an individual from HS and they were helpful and courteous on the phone.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing the warranty with the product (which I thought I did, but did not 🤔🥴) because you cannot purchase a warranty after the initial product purchase.<br />They do offer a 30d warranty, which is nice.<br /><br />Once again, great product for the price and it's great to learn on.

1025,1.0,Please do not buy- Does not respond to remote,"*UPDATE*<br /><br />After posting my initial review (noted below by the ""---"",) I received an email from the company thanking me for my purchase, and asking how they could make the situation right, as they wanted me to have a good experience with their company. I thanked them for reaching out, and informed them that I had already purchased another drone from a different seller. They replied and stated that they would still like to make the situation right, and offered to send me ""their best drone"" at no charge. I stated that that would not be necessary and re-iterated that I had already purchased another drone, however they asked again if they could send me another drone at no charge. I figured I would be happy to try the Holy Stone brand again, and would either have two drones, or could give one of them away to my brother who has been thinking about purchasing a drone.<br /><br />After a bit of back and forth with Holy Stone, I sent them my address to ship ""their best drone"" to me at no charge. After I sent them my address, they replied, stating that before they could send me the drone, they would need me to either edit or delete my initial review on Amazon of their product. This was red flag number one.<br /><br />I told them that I would not and could not change my review, until the replacement drone arrived and I had a chance to fly it to give honest feedback. They replied stating that ""they weren't sure if they'd be able to get managerial approval to issue me a replacement device at no charge with the negative review on Amazon."" I stated that that was fine, a replacement drone wasn't necessary- if they wanted to send me one, great, if not, no big deal, but I would not be changing my review until I had a chance to try their product again.<br /><br />Again, after more back and forth, they confirmed that they would be sending me ""their best drone"" at no charge, despite my negative review remaining on Amazon for the time being.<br /><br />The ""new"" drone arrived a few days later. I noticed when it arrived that the box was open, but didn't think much of it, I figured they probably send returned items out if they're sending free drones out. When I opened the box, I discovered that it was either the same exact drone that I had previously returned to them, or it was another drone that had the same exact issues as mine- snapped prop arm, scratched up propellers, etc.<br /><br />A whole lot of wasted time and energy. After I notified them that they sent me a broken drone, they told me there was nothing else they could do as they had already sent a replacement drone at no charge. Extremely disappointing. I would have been less upset if they had just refunded me my money and left it at that, but to then tie me up in back-and-forth communications for weeks regarding a free replacement drone, wasted my time, and only set me up for further disappointment by their company. PLEASE save your money and buy a DJI drone. Much better quality, and certainly much better customer service if and when you need it.<br /><br />---After doing a little bit of research and watching some comparison videos, I decided to purchase this drone, despite being advised against it by other reviews, and some friends (who insisted a DJI drone was the way to go....) Boy were they right!<br /><br />Admittedly, I have never flown a drone before in my life. When the drone was delivered, I took it out of the box, read the owners manual, and watched a few youtube videos to see if there was anything I needed to know, and took it outside to try it for the first time. Once I got the drone set up, and the controller/drone connected to my phone's wifi, it was time to go. I fired everything up, raised the drone off the ground, and without touching anything on the remote, the drone looped around and smashed in to the side of my house (cracking the siding) as if it had got caught up in a big gust of wind.... the only thing was, there was no wind whatsoever. I thought ""that's very strange"" and figured I'd try it again. The second time I got it off the ground, I had a little more success, but not much. The drone just didn't seem to want to react to what I was doing on the controller.<br /><br />I took the drone back inside and decided to watch a few more youtube videos about this particular model. The following weekend, I took the drone to my parents' house, who live on 7 acres of completely open land with minimal obstructions. Once there, I had a little more luck as there weren't many obstructions, but during the third flight of the day, I once again lost complete control of the drone (which I was standing almost directly under.) The drone took off full speed and slammed into a pine tree. It bounced off the trunk of the tree several times before it swooped around and went straight towards the house, crashing in to the deck, completely snapping off one of the prop arms.<br /><br />Luckily, Amazon stood behind the purchase and issued me a full refund, but I was extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to using the drone. I got to use it a total of 5 times, all of which were not stellar experience.<br /><br />I found a DJI Phantom 3 standard on facebook marketplace and it is like night and day. The DJI is SO easy to fly, the photo and video quality are a thousand times better, it has more features.... I'm so happy with my new purchase. Please, do yourself a favor and spend the little extra money and buy a DJI drone, even if it's used. You truly do get what you pay for.<br /><br />I forgot to mention, while I was trying to gain control of the drone at one point, it did hit me in the leg, slicing my leg open by one of the props. I didn't even realize it had cut me until later when I noticed blood on my leg. If you do by this drone, please be careful if you lose control of it!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MExrq5I0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MExrq5I0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MExrq5I0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S4Pf3clFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S4Pf3clFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S4Pf3clFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-eTqmLkqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-eTqmLkqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-eTqmLkqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81m261i3TUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81m261i3TUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81m261i3TUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGQCZ4K56EPGPLI4HOWVD22D3OOA,1666888263935,48,True

It's easy to fly and helps to keep a new pilot out of trouble.  I can't even begin to say how much fun the Holy Stone HS720E is to fly and how exciting it was to do so.  I had trouble going to sleep the first night because I kept playing over and over in my mind the different things the drone was able to do in flight.  You can't go wrong with the Holy Stone HS720E.

The app also directly records to your phone. The WiFi connection remains strong at far distances and video remains clear throughout each use, making the 4K video on the SD Card a delight to review. The only real complaint I have is the battery charging time, but that is to be expected with all drones.

At times, after the ""power off"" function used on the remote, three of the props would turn off but one would continue to spin and at other times two would turn off and then other times NONE turned off which meant the drone could not be picked up .  Ultimately the drone's lack of response to controls (only about 100 feet away) led to it being flown into a tree and breaking. Overall, I am not satisfied clearly and will be researching other drones.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGUGC7NJNFG7PUBDF55FYP72PAZA,1618455749832,0,False

It is easy to learn but you need to master your surroundings.<br /><br />I'm glad I've bought this particular drone, because it is for beginners. But also it doesn't hold your hand either.<br /><br />You still have to learn how to properly navigate around your surroundings  tho it seems more challenging at first but it's not at all.<br /><br />As far the remote control I think it leaves more to be desire to be fare. I don't like the antennas cuz it's only one really, while other is space holder for something else<br /> I get it, but still why put that for...... outside<br />my issue.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy about my purchase Once I master this drone I will be buying future drones.

1047,5.0,Very easy to pick up a new hobby with this drone,"This is my very first drone. Did some research and found several recommendations for this particular model based on the the quality of the camera and EIS technology, the battery life, and most importantly its suitability for beginners. The speed settings are great because they allow for more precise control if, like me, you're not confident with the controls on the first few flights and helps keep the drone in your line of sight. I would recommend checking out some YouTube videos to see the controls in action and learn the necessary routine to prepare the drone for take off (connecting the remote, phone app, calibrating drone etc). Highly recommend this model and the Holy Stone brand specifically.

1049,1.0,REVIEW UPDATE NUMBER TWO,"Tried to fly my replacement drone after it's first initial flight. Much to my dismay, it acted like my initial drone and took off on its own. First time, it took off laterally and on its second flight, it did its ever expanding circles again.  I appreciate the company sending out a replacement which at least shows good faith, but when the second drone acts like the first it tells me that there are quality control issues that they are not addressing.<br />After getting in contact with Holy Stone they sent out a replacement drone. I still haven't had a chance to try all of the functions, but at least the GPS return to home, distance, and height functions work on this one.  The only problem I had was getting it to keep the WiFi connection on the app at first.  Once I was able to connect, it seemed to work fine. (Previous review) I purchased the HS720e and haven't of been able to fly it successfully. I have followed the directions and have even went online to make sure that I have set up the drone properly. I have the correct system lights to indicate proper operation as well as the GPS indicating 16 satellites locked. On my first flight I had it take off automatically and once I raised it in the air 50 feet it took off to the right by itself. Fortunately I was able to gain control and bring it back to my area. I tried the return to home button and it wouldn't work.  The second time I flew the drone I had it locked on to GPS and again wouldn't operate properly. It had it take off automatically and just let it hover 5 feet off of the ground. It then started elliptical circles with each one being bigger than the other. I tried the return to home but the indicator on my phone said that it was.  I made sure that I was 1000 feet away from any WiFi or power lines just to make sure that there was no interference. I contacted Holy Stone support (not easy to do since their hours are 6:30pm to midnight PST. The agent told me that tech support would contact me, and to this date they haven't. I also tried contacting them through Amazon support and they still haven't responded.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEUJLYKS5KCOIFESHXPFHIUTIXGQ,1665767438028,3,True

Too heavy and too long of a charge time and not that much better for a beginner compared to 120D.  Seemed not to fly as reliably as the 120 and 3x the price.

1052,4.0,Drone has Rogue takeoff,I liked this drone for a while easy to fly and learn. But after about my fith or sixth flight I could fly it for about 5 to 10 minutes and then it would just take off on its own. And it would almost if not crash. I changed the props and it still did it. I called holy stone and reported the problem and they said to take a video of of it doing this. But its a little hard to take a video of it while I'm flying it and impossible when I'm trying to get control of it when it takes off on me. When I hover it it drifts around a lot and thats with 10+  Satellite. I guess it will be my last holy stone.,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHREQRCHBKM2G5MZ7PTRIVOFJGQA,1604758843333,1,True
1053,5.0,"Slight learning curve but exciting when you ""figure it out""!","[[VIDEOID:d38b35fce540c1961f0a7fc1b5e8e5a5]] This is my first drone.  My wife bought it for my birthday and because we are going on vacation to Utah (Moab, etc.) this summer.  We think this will be very cool to bring along and get some pics/vids from a new perspective (aerial)!  This review should be taken in the frame of thought that I am a beginner.  This review is meant to help other beginners who may face the same ""issues"" I had when first operating the drone.  Read the manual first but don't expect to memorize it.  There is quite a lot of information like max altitude, what happens when you press the ""return to home"" buttons, surfaces not to fly over, etc.  Don't be overwhelmed, but be as informed about what to expect before you fire it up for the first time.  I cranked it up in my living room on it's ""maiden voyage"" and immediately crashed into my couch.  Guess what...I didn't think it was that important to calibrate the drone like the manual instructed me to do!  Obviously, I was wrong!  The good news is, so far, the drone seems to be very well built.  The couch wasn't my first crash.  I crashed it relatively hard several times (maybe 3 or 4).  The blades have some scuffs and even some nicks after the crashes and the drone still flies great!  The drone comes with replacement blades should you need them.  Thankfully, I haven't crashed badly enough to need to replace them yet.  ;-)  Ok, to get to the meat of my limited knowledge so far.  The most important point, imho, is to realize that the drone is defaulted to ""beginner mode"".  I don't know if it states that in the manual (probably does), but that made me think that the drone was defective.  The first time I took it outside to test it out, it would go only so far away and just hover not responding to controls.  Apparently, when it reached the beginner limit (49 ft.) it won't let you do anything else.  I found this out when I got back from vacation (I took it to Colorado with me to test it the first time).  I thought that it was the snow and cold that may have been causing it to behave irradicably.  At my home, about 65 degrees outside, it still wouldn't let me control it when it went a certain distance.  After perusing the Ophelia Go app, I found the ""beginner setting"", switched it off, and, hooray, I was flying like a champ.  The video I posted with this review is the very first test flight not knowing about the ""beginner mode"" so don't judge me!  ;-)  Another issue I experienced that is nowhere in the manual is how difficult separating the antennas on the remote would be.  Be advised, you have to pull pretty hard to get those suckers apart but they will come apart!  The phone holder on the remote holds my LG V60 very sturdily.  I had to take mine out of the case in order for it to fit, though.  Oh, the flight time is severely limited in extreme cold.  The instructions tell you not to operate below 32 degrees fahrenheit.  My first flight was at about 10 degrees fahrenheit.  It probably flew for approximately 5 minutes before the battery notified me that it was low!  This lets you know that you can fly in colder, but you probably shouldn't nor would want to.  I just wanted to get a decent shot of our cabin and was excited to play with it!  In the end, take my advice or not, don't test it indoors first.  Go outside with as few trees or other obstacles as possible.  This drone does not have ""obstacle avoidance"".  Drones with that feature cost substantially more.  Overall, I'm having fun with this little drone and look forward to taking some great pics/vids on our next vacation in Utah.  Hopefully, I'll remember to come back to this review and upload some of them.  Hope you have great fun with your drone!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812d+Gh3OGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812d+Gh3OGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812d+Gh3OGL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819Sgs-+yWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819Sgs-+yWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819Sgs-+yWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81G3JkDj3RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81G3JkDj3RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81G3JkDj3RL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C4yc0lmvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C4yc0lmvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91C4yc0lmvL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91hhYPjOKML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91hhYPjOKML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91hhYPjOKML._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wnVS75HoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wnVS75HoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wnVS75HoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHOG5ATHLI4CXMKVD4KJZXH32FSA,1614447950281,6,True

I believe this is a good first drone. Was so exited to get the drone. Lasted 4 min. One the book says charging is 5 hrs for 20 min runtime. Fine. 7 hrs later still charging. Finally flew it and did fine for the first few mins then wouldnt respond. Lucky it was only about 2 ft from the ground when crash. No damage, but had to reach between the blades to pull battery to shut off. Ok after that and reset tried again. Flew fine for a few mins got alittle height and didnt respond. It was 50 ft from me. It crashed in a tree and well damage. 1 arm snapped and the other snapped when folding back into place. Very very thin plastic. And also noticed the body was getting hot. Not impressed.

Ooopsy.  I am amazed they don't advertise that point since it has saved the drone from crashing several times.  If you simply release all controls this drone will stop mid air and hold it's position and altitude, even when it's windy.

I found it fairly easy to get a feel for the controls, I practiced just flying and didn’t bother with the camera for a while. I maneuvered it around a fence post, backwards, forwards, sideways, flew low and slow but I really got the hang of it quite quickly. I attached my phone and started using the camera, it was a little strange at first watching the video as opposed to watching the drone and remembering that the controls reverse when it is flying towards you. I then disconnected my phone and linked it to my tablet to get a bigger picture, worked very well. I really like the fact that it comes in a nice case, has two batteries which gives me close to an hour of flying time and it seems fairly easy to fly.

Pushed the auto take off and it jumped up and hovered for about 30 seconds before starting to circle. bigger and bigger the circle got until it ran into the front of my truck.  2nd flight, same thing. Up to 5ft hold and then automatically took off circling. Tried to save but along with my movements on the controls it still had a mind of its own. Hit kill button on the controller and let that sucker drop to the ground.  3rd flight, again it had a mind of its own as starting circling. Tried to control again but it was happier flying by itself until that skipping off the ground like a rock you threw skipping across the lake.  Yup, gravel chipped up that set of blades.<br />Changed location to different park (in case there was too much interference although my phantom has never had a problem there) 4th flight, up to 5 ft hold and then the dreaded mind of its own.

1114,5.0,HolyStone hit a home run with this one.,"[[VIDEOID:f63930f114183936bf73fefb8614d603]] This drone was the first thing in the year 2020 to make me smile (even though it doesn't look like it in the video).  It was super easy to learn.  I've never flown an RC plane, car, or boat.  So I was a bit worried taking the leap for a $300.00+ drone without starting with a less expensive one first.  But the worry went way quickly after reading the instructions getting the FAA registration done and watching some people fly drones on Youtube.  I spent 3 days making sure I was legal and knew the rules and on the 4th day I flew.  Total air time was almost 40 minutes on a cold mostly overcast day with very little wind.  I've been out twice since the first day  The low quality video here is because the Micro SD card I had failed so I used my phone's video and I'm pretty sure that I had it in low res.<br />  Like I said before,  I'm a happy camper and look forward to honing my skills and photography.

1115,1.0,Major design flaw/defect/s.  As much as I wanted to love this I sadly would not recommend.,"I must say that I’m rather dissatisfied on many levels with this product. I purchased this drone against my better judgement (I was going to get a Mavic Mini but this seemed like it would offer me much of the same for a SLIGHTLY lower cost.) I have a small amount of drone flying experience. I have a friend who has a mavic pro and I’ve flown it many times while hanging out with him. K cool. This drone constantly lost signal. I tried many different locations many different times of day I tried it all. I’d start with between 12 to 16 satellites and about 500 feet later out it goes. Never could I get it to fly further than 500 feet DISTANCE away before it would lose all signal and return to home. One of the reasons I wanted a drone was for the follow me feature. Ininline skate and want to make videos and take photos and this feature seemed perfect. IT NEVER WORKED! I tried watching videos. I downloaded manuals I read the paperwork it came with. I did everything as per instructed and never did that work. Tried different starting distances from myself different heights. Times of day. Weather. Geographical location you name it. Nothing. That initially infuriated me but I got over it and figured I’d make the best of it. Now going back to the go home feature when you lose signal (at 500 feet away every time). This drone doesn’t prevent itself from crashing!  You have no signal so you can’t control it. I tried to lower it with the joystick nothing. Tried making it go left right, nothing. Why would it though? It had no signal. So flying about 7-10 feet high in my backyard. Everything is great. It loses signal and so it takes off upward and sideways to return to home. Into a tree it went at a height of about 50-60 feet. (Pine trees in Florida). There was nothing I could do it toppled, I stupidly tried to catch it (don’t try that kids it sliced my arm on the way down) and then the snapped the leg on the ground. This is clearly a design flaw as trees DO tend to happen on this planet and lots of them. If it’s losing signal and just taking off not on the path it came but in a most straight line direct route to home. It’s going to hit a tree. Period. Mine did within the first week of my having it. Needless to say I now need a new drone as this was also going to be used in my business. Now I’ll be getting the DJI Mavic brand as those DO have a way of not wrecking themselves in trees and rendering themselves 350 dollar paper weights. Again I’m not pleased. If I wrecked it then I wouldn’t be writing this review. This needs to be fixed so until then I’d save yourself a nice chunk of change buy spending a little more and just buy a mavic.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PtXnERbqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PtXnERbqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PtXnERbqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XIKdNKFIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XIKdNKFIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XIKdNKFIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AECKBMN5OF5TJDPDXKO2EPCGQRYA,1601412225417,62,True

1118,5.0,My first drone...and I'm impressed!,"I have no experience flying drones.  Never flown one, and don't really know anyone who has one. But I've always thought they were cool.  Well, on a whim, this was a Christmas present this year.  And, I've been very happy with this purchase.  I've not had too much flight time yet (still waiting for better weather), but here are my first impressions.<br /><br />Packaging is quality.  The provided case fits all the pieces well (drone, controller, batteries, miscellaneous) plus room for my phone. (FYI: I am using a Samsung Galaxy A50 with no SIM card exclusively for this drone. We had an extra one in the house and this then won't tie up my personal phone while I'm flying).  The included set of props is a nice inclusion, and the battery charger is small and doesn't take up a lot of room<br /><br />The build on everything seems solid and well put together.  Extending the arms on the drone is smooth, and there is a firm ""click"" when fully extended.  Collapsing the drone after flight is just as smooth.  The controller is plastic, but moving pieces (antennae, phone holder, grips) have firm movements and feel tight and don't move around when using.<br /><br />This drone is very easy to use.  Instructions are simple and generally intuitive.  I did watch some online reviews of this drone prior to purchasing so I did have some general understanding of the set up and controls prior to my first use.  I definitely recommend talking the time to familiarize yourself in this way before your first flight.<br /><br />Flight Prep is straight forward, including connecting you phone to the drove via WiFi, as well calibrating the drone's magnetic compass.  Automated take off and landing makes getting into the air and back on the ground simple.  In slow/tripod mode, the drone is very stable and easy to control.  Speed is limited and provides an easy flight.  Video is very stable, even with mild winds.  The ""image stabilization"" is very effective, and I notice no wind or rotor vibration in the small number of videos I've shot to date.<br /><br />I have not tested the limits of altitude or range at this point, and I've not drained the batteries to the point where the drone has automatically returned home.  I have charged both batteries 3 times with no issues, and I've flown 20+ minutes on a charge and still show 50% charge.  I'm not sure what the system has for buffers for a return flight, but I assume it's conservative to insure enough charge to get back to the origin and safely land.<br /><br />I only have a few negatives at this point:<br /><br />1) The phone mount on the controller is positioned in a way that it impedes easily using the buttons and switches on the shoulders of the controller.  It may be less of an issue if you have a smaller phone, but I think the A50 I use is relatively standard from a size perspective.<br /><br />2) The documentation / user manual could be better.  It gives you enough to get you in the air and using the drone, but leave gaps.  For example, you have the ability to turn the ""beginner"" mode off, so that you have full access to all limit controls, such as altitude, distance, orbit distance, etc.  But it doesn't do a good job of explaining what the settings do when you change them.  It takes a bit of practice figuring out the optimal setting for what you are trying to do, and this can be frustrating when your drone is 200 ft in the air and it won't do what you want it to do.<br /><br />3) This may be overly picky, but the batteries do no charge simultaneously.  So while the charger has two charging ports (one for each battery) they charge sequentially, and the second won't charge until the first is complete. With each battery taking as much as 5 hours to charge from a depleted state, plan on this being an ""overnight"" task.  This could be a limitation associated with these batteries and a way to improve safety, but...<br /><br />So, I would definitely support purchasing this if you've never had a drone before and are interested in getting into the hobby without too much of an initial expense.  Granted, I've nothing to compare this one to, but I am having fun with it (and I didn't crash it on my first flight), and for me, right now, that's all I was looking for!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AG2XOF2JEEBMN3JPKDNKBNRVEYWA,1614113959366,2,True

1124,5.0,"Excellent Auto-Stable, GPS Drone with High-Quality Camera","[[VIDEOID:737d74f0c7587633ae806d0034f7bcf4]] As a previous drone owner, I felt more confident in my drone flying abilities and felt it was time to step-up and take my droning hobby to the next level. I decided to purchase the Holy Stone HS720E. There is such a remarkable difference from my previous drones. The notable key features include GPS, auto-stabilization, and the digital display on the remote. Instead of having to rely on the Ophelia Go phone app for signal strength, the controller helped me keep an eye on drone battery level, controller battery level, and most importantly GPS numbers. Although the drone has a failsafe feature for the drone to return to its takeoff location when the battery is low or signal is lost, the GPS count helped me realize when I might lose signal to go ahead and land. The drones 2 speeds allowed me to take it off of sport mode and let one of my kids try it out with slower movements without me having to worry about them veering hard in one direction hitting a wall or something and not having enough time to correct them.<br /><br />The camera is absolutely wonderful! The new Electric Image Stabilization (EIS) feature made my photos and videos extremely clear. Previously, I’d have to stop the drone to take pictures or features but this feature allowed me to continue my flight having fun without sacrificing picture quality. The camera field of view adjusts 90° and allowed me to easily look straight down for overhead photos and look out on the horizon. The phone app to drone response time was superb as well allowing me to look at the phone for drone placement/pictures.<br /><br />The only thing to make this even better was a nice carrying case, an extra battery, spare parts, and a charging station that can charge both batteries. While the charging station only charges one battery at a time, it auto-swaps once one battery is fully charged. So after a long day of flying, I plug both of them in and don’t have to worry about checking the battery and swapping them around to charge the other battery. I wake up to both batteries fully charged. Absolutely in love with this drone!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MrSrI5eVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MrSrI5eVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MrSrI5eVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ibmeokpsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ibmeokpsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ibmeokpsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qqwizpRlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qqwizpRlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qqwizpRlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGTVWEPBWPDJOJUY5BGRDJ6E2BBQ,1599330745036,189,True

The HS 720E fit the requirements perfectly. Today was my maiden flight and it did not take long at all to get comfortable with flying it. I was able to fly with a fairly strong ocean breeze, it was stable and I did not have one scary moment!!

1149,4.0,"Good drone, easy to learn, video's could be smoother, lacking in flight time for the price.","I bought this because I got tired of the smaller less expensive drones losing connection to the remote and flying off or crashing and breaking.  I was looking for an fairly inexpensive model that also had a return to home feature.<br /><br />The purpose of the drone was to teach my grandson how to fly them as he really has enjoyed the cheaper variants from other vendors but always gets upset when they fun ends because of the aforementioned issues.<br /><br />I am very happy with the quality and capabilities for the price of it.  It was easy to learn how to fly and handled well even in a decent breeze.  Just make sure you are in a very open area if it's breezy to make sure that you have room to handle any drift issues because of the wind.  Be smart when flying, It's not a fighter jet and if things start getting out of control stay calm and take your hands off the controls and let the GPS take over to let the drone correct itself.  If you aren't trying to fly as fast and crazy as you ""can"" then you won't have to much trouble.<br /><br />The camera was good, definitely use an SD card.  I would have liked a smoother stabilizer as the video tends to be a bit jerky making the videos a little startling and difficult to watch.  The video/photos that you capture and get sent to the phone aren't great but the SD card images/video are better.<br /><br />Flight time isn't bad, only comes with one battery and extra batteries are a bit pricey but will likely buy some overtime so that I can fly it for more then 20 minutes every 5 hours.  I feel like you need at least 4 batteries to really feel like you can use the drone a suitable amount of time for the price and at $75 a pop that's quite an investment.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AH5N3GCJCOYV33NWD5U2HT6UHI5A,1660788417173,0,False

1155,5.0,Great drone and excellent value; good company in terms of customer support,"I've had this drone for about 2 weeks and have some experience with them.  In terms of value, this is a great buy and I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />The EIS function works great and the 4K images are beautiful.  There is no gimbal like the higher end drones.  That doesn't matter to me but you will notice it slightly when the drone turns or shifts position.  My main function is flying for fun and not commercial photography or movie making so consider your purpose.  Of course, you will pay a lot more for a 4K gimbal and they will be much more sensitive when bumped.<br /><br />Flying is great.  One feature that drove me to this drone was the controller.  It has a built in display with battery levels, GPS and signal strength.  It can take a photo or video just using controller buttons and that means if you want to just do a quick flight, you are good to go without the phone.  It means you can launch quick.  I like the unlock/lock button and the one button takeoff.  The auto land works but I think it may actually follow the phone.  I haven't tested this yet but I noticed on return if I've backed up on the deck, the drone backs up when coming in and I have to adjust as it lands.  If it did follow the phone GPS signal on auto return, that would be pretty cool.  Or it could just be a minor variance in return location.  Getting within a few feet is pretty typical for a return to home feature.<br /><br />This unit uses the Ophelia Go app.  There are a few critical reviews of the app and it rates a +-3 in the store.  Most of these are related to having issues connecting to the drone.  What I've determined is that it's dependent on the phone settings.  *MAKE SURE* you have the 'Wifi Preferences' >  'auto-switch to mobile data' setting turned OFF!  I tested and that seems to be the setting that is causing the issues.  It makes sense if you think about it as the drone will not be providing an internet connection so the phone will cut it off.  That would not be the fault of the app.<br /><br />Overall, I like the app.  It's pretty simple and easy to use without the 10 pages of disclaimers like in the DJY Fly app.  3 clicks and you are in and the rest is completely intuitive.  One feature I was delighted to find was a digital zoom.  It's a little small to use but really handy to be able to get a little closer to your subject.  It's not always possible to fly closer safely so that's really valuable.<br /><br />One app feature that did scare me a bit was the tapfly.  This is where you tap and click on a map for where you want the drone to go and it then follows that flight plan.  I 'believe' it actually downloads it into the drone after you hit submit.  I had one experience with this where I had the wrong directions in and the drone did indeed do what I told it to do.  The problem was I couldn't get the controller to cancel it.  Perhaps the app was needed to do cancel or it's not possible but I will be staying away from that until I understand it more.<br /><br />The drone itself is build solid and very strong.  I did have one minor issue with my camera continuing to move after I let up the button.  After a bit of troubleshooting it appears to have been in the controller and all I can say is that Holystone support was incredible.  They worked with me over email to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.  Every time I sent an email, I got a response within hours.  I always got follow up emails signed with a persons name (no form emails) and in the end they took care of the issue for me.  I'm really impressed with that level of personalized service in this age.

It flew fine after that.<br />  Next flight, days later.... It got off the ground and to altitude fine, but a few minutes in, it started doing ""Figure 8's"" with no controller input. Figured I must've done something wrong, like turned orbit mode on or something, so shut my phone and the controller both off hoping it would find its way back. It eventually did, after a few more  minutes of screwing around up there....<br />  Third- fourth- fifth- flights, it was fine.

Went out of control a few times on me and the emergency power down on the remote would not stop the propellers even after the crash landing each time... had to yank battery. From all the reviews and videos watched on product seems here and there people have same issues with theirs. Could be where I live with mountains around. Went out of range for video feed and the return home features brought the drone back and it almost landed perfectly back on take off pad as seen in photos but as the propellers slowed to touch down the wind was enough to make it miss the mat. Over all satisfied. Photo at 300 feet is right off the app so quality is no where as good as when you take it off the sd. Using to photo cars as well so the feature that goes around a set point is nice and you can get a good angle that you can’t do by hand. Image is very stable when videotaping. The heads up feature is nice to be able to turn on/off when you fly the drone in site and not with looking at video feed in the screen, especially as a beginner getting use to flying a drone for its easy to loose track of the nose.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AarlVc3yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AarlVc3yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AarlVc3yL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1DsEPqIDpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1DsEPqIDpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1DsEPqIDpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1ysoOShE0S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1ysoOShE0S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1ysoOShE0S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFMQ7NQMXNXHYV5K4JWHMATRTM5Q,1607172682120,0,True

Second problem solved. I live in an area where there is a lot of airplane and helicopter traffic, so not sure if that had anything to do with the drone not connecting to the GPS satellites, but I went to the next park over (5 or so miles) just to be safe and found an open area and voila, GPS a go.

I got this drone for taking on vacations and just flying around my home for fun, and to learn how to actually fly one so that it's second nature. I was able to take the attached video after only having flown the drone one other time prior to this. The slow mode coupled with EIS helped me take, IMO, a good first-time video.

1229,5.0,"Great Drone for everyone, easy to use.  Great pictures!","This was my first drone.  Absolutely loved it!<br />I'm a avid photographer, been walking around with my DSLR and  iPhone for many years.  The only thing I was  missing are the aerial shots and believe it or not - pictures on myself :-)  I got  the HS H720E after extensive research for ease of use, capabilities and price.  after all  I don't want to crash and burn something more expensive and what happens if I don't like flying drones.<br /><br />The HS720E was a great buy!  It matched all of my criteria's after I finally learned how to properly fly and use the feature from the app.  there was a slight learning curve for a total beginner.  But with the combination of the instructions manual (yes- I actually read the instructions) and online tutorials on YouTube, you'll be flying pretty quickly.  One note, you need to use a phone with a cellular, GPS and WIFI turned on to use the features (Follow me, set waypoints, etc.) on the app.  The detailed map will not show unless your phone have an active cellular plan.  How did I know this?  I tried flying using the app with a old cell phone (no cell or data plan), the detail map does not show and the (follow me and set waypoints) features will not work.<br /><br />With that said, the HS720E and all the features worked well!  It was a great drone for the price.  Love the 'fly home' and 'low battery' features so you can get the drone to come back and land 'close' to where you took off.<br /><br />Where they can make some improvements?  Need a better phone holder - my iPhone 11 occasionally popped off.<br />Also need a cover for the SD card so you don't accidentally push on the card and it pops out.  I put a piece of tape there to prevent this from happening.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great buy!  Will absolutely recommend this to a new drone pilot.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TUmieEj7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TUmieEj7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TUmieEj7L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFX7AOJKRBYQB3WQ5HQ3WHOP6MXA,1607713493945,0,True

1231,5.0,Great Quality Drone,"Recently I purchased this drone after using the 4 HS-160 Pro drones I’ve had. The HS160 Pro drones were a great drone to learn flying on so I could move up to this drone. This drone is faster but just as easy to fly as the HS-160 Pro and flying time is much longer so I have more fun. It is very easy to get it set up and fly and the ability move the camera up and down is a big plus for taking pictures and videos. It moves smoothly so there’s no jerky video. It is a strong flying drone which makes possible to fly in windy weather and still get fast response and smooth hovering. I had an issue when I first bought it and contacted support. A day later I had the information I needed, my mistake for not reading the manual completely. They are a real pleasure to work with and they answered all my questions in a well informed and very professional way. I have many Holystone products and the quality of each is great. I have grandkids who I fly with, the youngest is 7 and the oldest is 12 and each one was flying within 5 minutes of learning the controls. Within a hour they were out flying me which made them very happy and they rubbed it in my face when we got home and told they parents! I would unhesitatingly recommend these drones for beginners and above.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHD7MRPACJ5PQMAKH4M3BBY27EFQ,1614247338796,0,True
1232,3.0,Fun Drone But Failed After 5 Hours of Fly Time,"This drone was fun to fly. It has a Tripod mode which offers a fairly stable platform in mild wind conditions. When selected into Fast mode, the drone will take off, fly forward, to what I was able to speed test to 10MPH. The Drone did start to get shaky in video quality at 10 feet and 30 meters in the air. It's a decent drone to learn how to fly. Now for the horror story. I was waiting for an amazon prime delivery, and I thought it would be fun to send the drone up and watch the van as I tracked it with my laptop. As you may know, some Prime vans offer GPS locations of their trucks. I sent it up to 30 meters (like I have done several times) and after about 5 seconds of reaching the desired altitude I lost connection for roughly 2-3 seconds. I regained video connection only to watch the drone in a diagonal nose dive straight into my neighbors roof. The impact was so loud I was sure the drone was destroyed. My neighbor heard the impact, came out and recovered the drone from his roof. Luckily there was no damage to his property, which was my biggest concern. None the less, I will not be buying another drone from this company. It was supposed to maintain altitude and return to its take-off location, NOT turn into a Japanese Zero from WWII. $400 dollars down the drain.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wUDV-LDlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wUDV-LDlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61wUDV-LDlL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGHQC3MFHIQHTIWXFDY7N5HAJHJA,1624761948598,1,True

1234,5.0,- Incredible Drone - Amazing Customer Service,"- While this is my first drone, I've flown several others owned by friends. By far, the Holy Stone 720E is the most stable to fly. Its features and incredible camera make it comparable to drones with much higher price tags. It is a joy to fly from the first takeoff and even more so with each subsequent flight. The return to landing feature is especially nice for beginning drone fliers. A great drone at a terrific price point. -- Early on, I had some questions regarding the set-up. Called Holy Stone customer service and got a real person almost immediately. The customer service representative was perfectly knowledgeable....I didn't feel like they were reading off a script...they knew what to do personally. She actually stayed on the phone with me until I accomplished her instructions to ensure they worked perfectly. You don't get that kind of customer service often. A couple of weeks later, I had another problem and again, they handled it perfectly and 100% to my amazed satisfaction. --- So, with the Holy Stone HS720E, you'll get a fantastic drone and outstanding customer service!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y68rcbEcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y68rcbEcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y68rcbEcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEFOFLNBY5L4233YAVNRJKA2FSPA,1606438028471,0,True

Fine, I thought, I'd seen that you could order replacement arms here on Amazon, but they're now listed as ""currently unavailable"" with no estimated availability date. Same on another site I searched, which leads me to believe I've got a $300 paperweight in my garage. I guess there's a reason these are priced as they are. Original review follows below.<br /><br />I've always thought drones were pretty cool and I thought it'd be fun to shoot some aerial stills and video. But when I first started looking at them the entry level models ran at least $500-$600, and that just seemed a lot to put at risk on something I was very likely to crash while I learned how to use it. So when I saw the Holy Stone HS720e at under $300, I took a closer look at the specs, read a few reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, and decided I couldn't pass it up. And, so far at least, I'm VERY glad I bought one.<br /><br />Let me get the negatives out of the way right up front. While the drone itself feels very well put together, the controller has a somewhat cheap feel to it. The part of the controller that holds the cell phone feels a bit like it's going to break every time I extend it. On top of that, it's barely large enough to hold my phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra), and even then only after I remove the phone's protective case. I fly my drone in constant fear that my rather expensive phone will fall out and splatter itself all over the ground. So that's out of the way, let's get to the good stuff.<br /><br />As I said, the drone itself feels very sturdy, and has already survived one minor mishap in which I managed to get it stuck in a tree and had to knock it out with a pole saw. It fell about 25 feet to the ground and I went right back to flying it. Flying is easy - it takes only a few minutes of familiarizing oneself with the instructions and the controls to get flying right away. If you get disoriented and lose track of where the drone is facing, just take your hands off the control sticks and it'll hover in position until you can re-orient yourself. Position holding is rock solid, which I tested by having it hover about five feet off the ground and then carefully moving it a few feet away by hand. The drone went right back to where it was hovering. The other features - return to home, follow me, and point of interest circling - all work as advertised and are features I'd have expected to find in much more expensive drones.<br /><br />I'll close here with just a couple of notes. Not negatives, just words of caution. First, this drone does NOT have obstacle avoidance, as evidenced by my unfortunate early encounter with a tree. I'll make sure my next drone does have that. Second, the drone's color is a slate gray, which on a few occasions has caused me to lose sight of it against a background of similar color, like early spring woods with no foliage. What I did each time was stop and let the drone hover, then execute a few vertical movements until I spotted it again. Maybe my next drone will be white. Or bright pink or something.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend the HS720e. At its price, it over-delivers on expectations, and the only reason I'm giving four stars and not five is because of the controller.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHDFNAZSFTP4KPAWJFJEMWQIWZNA,1679353246912,4,True

1249,5.0,Incredible and easy to use drone!,"[[VIDEOID:903be5626663807086135c3acca00711]] I’m so happy with this drone. It’s incredibly easy to fly and very intuitive. The controller shows the GPS level (which is super helpful after losing a previous drone) and the distance/height which makes it easy to bring down and land near you.<br /><br />It’s super easy to fly and the GPS mode is very good. If it gets out of range, you’ll likely lose the WiFi feed to your phone but the controller continues to work. If it gets out of the controller range, the controller will beep and the drone will retreat to get back in range to ensure you don’t lose the drone. The return to home can be a LIFE SAVER and makes landing very, very easy. The drone comes in beginner mode, but you can easily change this once comfortable and the distance range is quite impressive. It’s also nice to see the location on the map.<br /><br />The drone records amazing 4K photos and videos and the image stabilization is a really great addition. Another nice feature is that you can’t see the propellers in the camera, like you can on other drones. This really allows for quality images.<br /><br />Can’t recommend this drone enough!

1257,5.0,Don't rush into flight,"This is my first drone as I'm new to the drone world.  Based on the suggestion of a friend, I ended up looking into and going with the Holy Stone HS720e.  The price point on this drone was manageable and didn't hurt the wallet.<br /><br />After a fast one-day delivery and a little dabbling, I'm impressed and glad that I went with the Holy Stone family.<br /><br />As I get some more flight time under my belt, I'll be coming back to update this review.  For now, though, a few key take-aways.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />- This is a solid drone.  My first flight ended in crashing into a tree and an inverted landing.  This was solely based on picking the wrong day for my first flight (wind picked up as fast as initial takeoff).  I was impressed with the fact that as soon as the drone made contact with the very forgiving tree, the motors instantly shut off before it dropped into the snow.  The soft impact with the tree and equally soft inverted landing resulted in no damage to the drone.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />- I was a little disappointed on a phone/drone/transmitter connection issue.  My current daily phone is a Google Pixel 5 running Android 11.  Ophelia Go app installation was a snap.  Connecting via wifi however was where things changed.  I have yet to determine why the phone would not stay connected via wifi or sometimes even not connect at all.  When I was able to connect, the camera wouldn't load in the app.  Fortunately, I had access to a couple older phones and once they were connected (for testing purposes), the camera imagery showed instantly.  This was after I learned that for whatever reason, not all android phones are the same when it comes to connecting to wifi devices.  In finding this information, I learned from other HS720e owners that iPhones seemed to present fewer connection issues than Android phones.  It seems that it's ""hit or miss"" with Android phones.<br /><br />***For any future buyers reading this review, be sure you have an extra (and older phone) handy in case you run into the same problem I did. ***<br /><br />- One other issue I have with the app is what I see on screen once my phone is connected to the drone.  Across the top, there are Chinese characters and numbers showing (picture to be updated later).  The best that I can determine, this is video quality info.  It would be nice to be able to change a setting that removes that info as it overlays on other information.  As I wasn't able to see the information underneath, I can't determine if the underlying information was pertinent. (look for additional input on that in my update)",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AF4T5RJUNL2PMWTBADN3236EFMPQ,1612883935650,0,True

1259,1.0,Updated review.  Drone pairing but not responding to transmitter.,"On 1st use it seemed to require complicated set up and initialization.  But after a few times it is getting easier.  The drone doesn't seem to be extremely responsive to the joystick controls.  Takes a while after joysticks are moved for the drone to respond.  Also, as the drone battery gets low, I had an incredibly difficult time to get the drone to respond to the joysticks.  With the left joystick (throttle) held all the way down, the motor kept increasing in RPM and the drone continued to gain altitude.  Only when the battery indicator changed to one mark and the controller began to beep did the drone lower itself in altitude on its own.  But it did not return to home.  The battery technology doesn't seem to meet the needs of this drone.  Really short flight times.  Not quite what is advertised.  And an incredibly long recharge time.  Takes all the fun out.  The drone seems to be affected very easily by extremely light winds.  Update 2/4/21:  Drone no longer controllable with transmitter.  Can pair drone with transmitter, and WiFi with cellphone.  Go through set up operation without any problems, turned off ""beginner"" mode and set safety distance and height to max.  Drone takes off and once it is 10 feet in the air it will no longer respond to joy stick controls; rotate left or right, forward, or backward.  It flies around on its own, flying in circles, moving left and right, up and down, lowering to the ground and bouncing several times.  It will not shut off, even holding the shut off button more than 5 seconds.  Pressing and holding the power button will not shut the motors off.  I have to carefully grab it and remove the battery to stop it from spinning the motors.  Once it took off, and on its own sped extremely fast in a 90 degree left flight, and flew into the limbs of a tree.  The return time has expired.  I called Holy Stone and they want me to just send them video of the erratic behavior.  But my phone is connected to the transmitter and I have no other video device.  Just too bad.  Holy Stone doesn't seem to want to take this unit back for replacement.  I thought they were better than that.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHMKOERC3PWHRSYPIZ77MUJLI5DA,1607535542201,8,True
1260,5.0,Solid Customer Support,Was having a bug where I was losing partial control once the drone flew 30-feet or so away. During one of these it drifted uncontrollably into a tree branch and left a tiny mark on the body of the drone. At that point I reached out to Holy Stone support to figure out what was going wrong with it. Lily with their customer support promptly responded and went through some Q&A and troubleshooting with me over a few emails and shared some video of the issue. Nothing was working. So They offered up a full replacement and to keep the faulty drone for spare parts. Wow! Now that’s customer service! Seriously impressed.<br /><br />The only tiny issue I have is with the remote. The antenna snap in the closed position and took me a few to find in the manual how to release them. It should be more up front in the manual. Then the iPhone holder that slides out tilts up/forward when the phone is locked in. The weight of my iPhone is heavy enough that it won’t stay tilted forward sometimes. Both very minor issues.<br /><br />Let’s see how the replacement works but figure with support like this I’m sure I’ll be flying again  soon!,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AF3MJP2TK4ELQ422MRRX236FUYMQ,1656572636746,0,True

1267,3.0,"Novelty ""Pro"" Drone.","This was recommended as a low-cost entry pro model for images and video. I wanted to see what a $300 drone had to offer these days, particularly after hearing about all these rave reviews on the utubes and amazon reseller review pages. The unit seems put together well enough, but when you understand the difference between this drone .vs a drone made by a more established drone technology manufacture with actual innovative pro-level features, the novelty wears off real quick and you are left wanting more. The HS720 does a good job of mimicking what other low-tier pro-sumer drones are doing on a budget, but it performs slightly better than a $100 basic entry fpv model.  I have seen Holy Stone and others toss the tag ""Professional images and video"" around this drone and it is, very far from being that level of drone. Boasting a few numbers for marketing sake and a 4k sensor does not = to a Pro user experience.<br /><br />I was so disappointed with overall build quality (particularly the camera motor gearing -Ew!).  The app Ophelia Go is a very basic app for your FPV control /review and it works just fine, but no wows to be found here.  The 4k video is okay as long as you don't move the camera axis, otherwise the aspect ratio fish-eyes and distorts the image rendering your video-capture work useless unless you fix it via software. (this issue has long been vacant on other models and this is not a good look anywhere).  2 flight speeds + all these ""tracking/follow"" features, you do the math. For the love of drones, get something that can adjust/vary speed.<br /><br />Look, let's be real here. Digital Image Stabilization (which = to area loss and sometimes loss of quality to stabilize the image) is no match for a 3 point gimbal and a 300-400 range drone is not going to perform as well as 600-1500 drones. There is a 500 range hump that you need to cross. This $300 drone reminded me/convinced me to spend another 800.00 to get a more realistically functional one that will be used for commercial use.<br /><br />I cannot say I can recommend the HS720 for any reason, not at 300 dollars, no way. This unit feels like it is loaded with low-grade consumable tech and should be priced 150-180 range.<br />If you are looking for a FPV drone with some basic automated flight settings go the $100 route, otherwise research the heck out the model/s you think fits your needs and then dig deep into your pockets.<br /><br />*Update after a couple months 4 new drones of various types, sizes and manufactures. The HS720 by far was the most dangerous, unstable and worst drone experience to date.<br /><br />I would hope to see this unit pulled for safety reasons.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AG7UKVYKGQWKOJ4PTUIQ5AMNAXKA,1620545764553,10,True

1282,5.0,Absolutely amazing,This is my first time buying and flying a drone and the experience has been pretty fulfilling.  When I first got the delivery of the drone in the Amazon box I immediately thought that the actual drone must have been smaller than I anticipated looking at the size of the box.  But to my surprise when I open the drone box and the carrying case the wings/legs were foldable.(I love that feature).  Being that it was my first drone I was a bit apprehensive about how the setup experience and how my maiden flight would be.  But the instructions were pretty straightforward.  I downloaded the app and everything was set for my maiden flight.<br /><br />I must say that operating this drone was a lot easier than I expected.  The ophelia Go app has a preset restricted mode for beginners which allowed me to get a good feel of operating the drone correctly.  The remote control was easy to learn and gave signal to the drone as i intended.  For a beginner I was very satisfied with the flying experience that I had on my first flight. The flight was steady and the powerful 3d camera captured the video very wonderfully.  I definitely would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a drone.,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHRVKTZYZZES7V5MZZ5YUFR36HJQ,1610996329683,1,True

It was always horizontal. I called Amazon support but they were not able to help (probably because I had a bad unit) but they gave me the manufacture Info. I contact them and they where able to provide a replacement in just a few days. The new unit I receive work perfectly, I just need to practice more to be able to get better videos.

I asked neighbors on the street if they say anything and someone mentioned hearing it zoom off in the direction of nearby woods and a crashing sound.<br />The trees are dense with foliage right now with tons of underbrush and hanging vines. I was never able to find it.<br /><br />It's shocking to spend over $350 on something that would fail so spectacularly on its first small run.<br />I had read some mixed reviews of this drone and thought that maybe this one would work out, so I decided to take a risk on it.  Now I can't even find it after it just took off on its own.<br />It seems clear to me that there is some kind of bug in the firmware that runs this drone and they pushed it out without properly testing it and fixing the issues that would cause this.<br /><br />Right now, all I know is that I want my money back!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />After my review, the company reached out to me directly and offered a free replacement.<br />I'm upgrading my review based on the quick response and offer to replace.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AE3TRNRIGBTRYXF42AQECINKWBAA,1630616210315,0,True

1313,5.0,Holy Stone's Best Yet,"[[VIDEOID:ba23a56a9455a29aa5b0c400bb8b1694]] This has been the best-performing drone from Holy Stone that I've had a chance to play with so far. Mind you, we are still in the Sub-$400 price point, so this is no DJI Mavic, but for the money this has some excellent qualities.<br /><br />Opening the box, you have everything packed compactly into a carrying case, which is great for travel. The drone feels well-built and not cheap plastic. The drone arms unfold and snap into place very easily, as long as you unfold the front arms first. There is a microSD slot for a memory card (up to 128GB). The battery packs slide and snap firmly. The charging apparatus (see photo) is a bit odd. It does sport a high-amp USB C cord, and has a fold-out clip for two batteries, however it will only charge one at a time. A fast-blink Indicator light tell you which one is charging. Meanwhile, the controller takes 2 AA batteries.<br /><br />Pairing is about the same as other Holy Stone drones, requiring gyroscope calibration and GPS lock-in, but the lights are easier to see. On the back of the drone are 4 LED lights to visually show battery level (also shown on the controller screen or the Ophelia GO app. Take-off and landing is pretty simple with one-touch buttons for both. This drone only goes to about 50ft for its return to home function, unlike others that shot way up to 100 ft.<br /><br />The marquee feature of this drone is enhanced image stabilization. Mind you, this is no replacement for a gimbal, but initial tests show that it does smooth out some of the jitter and jerking when you are moving the drone. See the attached unretouched video for an example. I moved the drone side-to-side and the picture will shift a bit to adjust, but you don't see the smaller wiggles usually common with these gimbal-less drones. In the video, you see the drone descending as it maintains GPS position, you see a nice and smooth descent.  Also, shooting direct into the sunset, you can see some pretty decent dynamic range with the view, and the 4K video quality is a great improvement too.<br /><br />The Ophelia GO software seemed to work OK on my 8"" Samsung tablet (better viewing than on my tiny phone), but the software does have some glitches. Every now and then the first-person view freezes and it will say ""disconnected"", even though I can still see flight status and control movement from the app. Lesson here is to use the controller for movement, use the app for picture taking.<br /><br />I didn't try the follow-me or orbiting mode, but I imagine they work pretty much the same as previous drones, with the added bonus of image stabilization.<br /><br />This is going to be my go-to drone for the time being!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61694aeIgZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61694aeIgZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61694aeIgZL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61AB+7I0kqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61AB+7I0kqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61AB+7I0kqL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VtGX+gfrL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VtGX+gfrL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VtGX+gfrL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fhdlkIuFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fhdlkIuFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fhdlkIuFL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NqSyFcnaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NqSyFcnaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NqSyFcnaL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SvCxnD+5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SvCxnD+5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SvCxnD+5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c3uDNejzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c3uDNejzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81c3uDNejzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AF53XVDPGOJDGGA4M5DVHEGMVXRQ,1599099227986,95,True

A+ Customer Service.","[[VIDEOID:55e9e9e00e290b32d6a2dd91bd974bcf]] This is a very robust drone, easy to set up and fly after watching a couple of YouTube tutorials. It shoots 4k video and does a great job at it but for me where it falls down is the still camera. Still images are fine for social media or other low res applications but not for any sort of commercial or print work where they'll come under scrutiny. I've attached a little video footage and a still to illustrate. For the price point, if you're looking to shoot only video it's a great little drone. Where Holy Stone really shines is customer service though. I bought mine for a trip to East Africa, I had shot more or less all I needed to when it got a little squirly and ended up crashing into the beach, snapping off an arm. I wrote to Holy Stone and sent them the video from the flight and 5 days later I received a brand new drone in the mail and was told I could keep the wrecked one for parts.

Earned my degrees in Electronic Engineering, Professional Aeronautics, and a Masters in Business Administration. Starting a new career in people and real-estate photography.<br />The drone so far has been an excellent purchase for a newbie in flying them. In the past, I've found drone flying overly frustrating. It's the control during flight being my biggest issue. I absolutely love that this drone will hover and wait for the next command. The ones in my past only hovered going in a particular direction and ended up crashing into something constantly.<br />The drone seems sturdy, yet light enough for flight.  I've crashed it once, but it was low and indoors. There were no visible signs of flight problems after the crash.<br />The best feature is the ""return to home"" although I think the increase in altitude once it loses radio signal should be an option to control as to how high it will go. Either put it in the app or make it a stand-alone button.<br />Additionally, for the next build, I would make a way to reset the ""RETURN TO HOME"" on the fly.<br />*** More about the ""WHY"" of this option at the bottom.***<br /><br />*The clarity of the photos, as well as the video are amazing!!!!<br />*Loved the HI and LO speed selections!!!<br />The simplicity of automatic controls such as FOLLOW ME and POINT OF INTEREST was a genius move on the part of Holystone.  As you can see from the video, the one-button selection allowed the drone to follow me all the way home. Additionally, I still enjoyed the ability to control the camera and I think YAW, as it followed me, my daughter, and my dog.<br />The ""follow path"" option I haven't experimented with yet, but my hope is that it's as good as everything else.<br /><br />In the next build, I suggest Holystone should add sensors to allow the drown ""when in low speed"" to detect and avoid things such as walls or trees. Moving up, down, left, right, or just stop when it comes to a preset distance from an object.<br />This may be something available in this drone and I've just not run across it yet, but it's an idea for a future build.<br /><br />******, REMEMBER to LAND the drone to RESET the RETURN TO HOME.

Had built in camera and you can record video and photos while you fly to either/both your phone or an SD card.  Very cool that you have a controller with info but also can connect up a phone to see the drone's camera view in real-time.  I really can't say enough about how nice this is.

From my experience it is a very stable and a great drone for beginners and for those who wants some advancement is drone video and photography. I like the features that comes with it especially the follow me which allows you to fly hands-free. My major concern initially was I was having difficulty hovering it and I dont know whether it was the gps calibration or the wind outside. So far it has been a good experience and look forward to updating my review in future should I encounter anything more. I may get another one for my son when we get familiar with this one.

I calibrated before each of the 5 times I flew it using both batteries easy time. It started off good and went south.<br /><br />First it developed a shimmy in midair while hovering. Like one prop would slow down and that corner would dip. I reset everything and calibrated it again and charged the batteries. The next time it just wondered off to the side. GPS count of 15 and all batteries full. I had to keep it steady, it would never settle down and hover.<br /><br />The last time I tried to fly it days later, full batteries and I did both calibration steps.... This time the front props spun up and the rear props didn't and it flipped backwards off my picnic table and broke the gimbal.<br /><br />I gave it two stars due to Holy Stones fast response to emails.

1418,5.0,The HS720E offers a compelling blend of features and performance,"This is my first drone purchase and something I’ve wanted for a long time for the ability to take aerial photographs of my property and gardens, and to gain a different perspective of the world through photography. A few years ago I had reserved a Lily but they went under before coming to market and I only just now picked-up the interest again. I was originally looking at the DJI Mavic Mini, but paused because I wasn’t fully comfortable with the cost, so I ended-up looking at Holy Stone instead because the price barrier was lessened for me, and the reviews were positive. I’m very pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />I have not nearly begun to fully explore the features and am especially interested in the GPS waypointing, the Follow Me feature, and some other neat tricks, but I will share a few first impressions about initial ownership.<br />The Holy Stone comes in a very nice case and the overall process from opening the box to first flight is straight-forward and intuitive. The quality of the materials, fit and finish are all very high; even the plastic parts wrappings have a high-quality feel to them. I spent about a half hour reading the manual (which was clearly written) and downloading the Ophelia GO app needed (?) to control flight and imagery. It was an easy path to first flight.<br /><br />The camera and flight controls were easy and intuitive, and I found the drone to be responsive of every command and action (with the exception of that RTH mode – more on this below – where is ignores any inputs and just rushes home… it would be nice to have “override” flight control even when this mode is invoked.)<br />Since this tiny machine is entirely dependent on its battery for safe, functional use, let me start with a few observations about battery life:  first it must be said that the efficiency of the motors and flight controls even allowing operation for 20-30 minutes is impressive.  I will also note that the charge time on the batteries is frustratingly elongated: it takes 5-6 hours per battery, so if you want to really be able to enjoy the drone for any period of time (and especially if you’re traveling to location somewhere), you definitely want lots of spares charged and ready.<br /><br />My opening flight experience demonstrated that the battery usage meter is woefully inaccurate: on a brand new freshly-charged battery (maiden flight), at two bars remaining (out of four) the drone went into Return To Home (RTH) mode and darted off. Unfortunately, “home” was in the front yard and I was presently in the back yard – all heavily treed – and I had not yet learned to set the RTH altitude higher than the default of 49 ft. so I observed helplessly as the machine zoomed away only to hear the sickening sound of pfft...pfft…pfft as it dove into leafy branches and tumbled down to the ground shortly thereafter.  I walked to the front yard on a recovery mission whilst browbeating myself into acceptance of a short-lived and expensive period of initial drone ownership, and lamented my $300 mistake…<br /><br />Thankfully – gratefully – once I retrieved the drone and rubbed the dirt off the body, I found no lasting damage.  I suspect the “impact” against the leafy branches softened the blow, as did the similarly buffered journey from treetop to ground. I figure it merely tumbled between branches and ultimately had a dead gravity fall of perhaps “only” ten feet onto soil.  Still, the fact that the drone survived such “operator error” mishap greatly – though not recklessly – increased my confidence in the sturdiness of the drone. Still, this event taught me to change the RTH altitude, and to not trust the battery levels for anything two-bars or less. This means any “brave” maneuvers such as, for example, over-water flight will only be done with a four-bar fully-charged battery – and very briefly at that. This drone is not waterproof, so this bears keeping in mind as well, especially if any water overflights are contemplated.<br /><br />During my first flight session, I tested the altitude capabilities and paused when the drone was little more than a tiny dot in the sky above my head. To me, it was crazy-high in the air and I imagined I was at the upper limit; I later found out from the flight log that the highest initial altitude of that flight was 190 ft. In other words, less than HALF of the full altitude capability of this little drone, which is mighty impressive. And even at that low altitude, the images taken from the camera aimed at horizon level had a curve to them, lending the feeling that this thing was miles into the air and showing the curvature of the Earth (unless you’re a Flat Earth Society person and don’t believe that nonsense ;)<br /><br />The camera quality is good, but I would not say I was astounded by the clarity. When zoomed in detail, it is clear – no pun intended – to see the limitations in resolution. I’m not sure if this is a factor of the image stability, limitations on the camera itself, or perhaps unreasonable expectations from me. I would not say I was disappointed – after all, the ability to take these aerial shots is itself amazing – but I think the clarity of the camera on my iPhone SE (2020) is better.  Then again, I cannot reliably toss my iPhone 200 feet into the air and snap a picture!<br /><br />All in all, the build quality is impressive, the packaging and documentation feels high-quality, and the features and capability are quite superb for this modest price point.  I would highly recommend this drone given the quality and capabilities, not to mention the “gee-whiz” fun factor, all of which make it entirely worth the investment!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFWV4WQ7MB5FYST4U4EKHML4W5HQ,1600278551298,94,True

1432,5.0,Beginner friendly with many nice features and video.,[[VIDEOID:eb95993f9180848c8e97c2e303fe4a07]] I'm a novice to this level of drone and this is the most advanced drone I currently own. I have not used all the features yet and I will edit this review when I do.<br /> Thus far I have used it to see the river and also to look for a lost RC plane.<br /> I base this review from a BEGINNER/NOVICE viewpoint. Overall I am very pleased with this drone at the current price point. It has a nice small carry case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The controller is very user friendly and fit my Samsung S10+ Just fine.<br />Taking off is straight forward with speed selection available. I use the fastest speed for two reasons: to provide more powerful and immediate control when flying in minimal to moderate wind and to allow faster maneuverability.<br />I tried a video with moderate wind and the drone held position very well. It was not rock solid but the drift was very minimal and IMPRESSIVE.<br />Battery life was fine with indications on your phone through the app and on the controller as well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Just one issue: the battery charge time seems long and I do not like the connection method between battery and charger. Its usable but a bit annoying.<br /><br />Overall I'm very impressed and pleased.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lblaX545L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lblaX545L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lblaX545L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFJMIVSVY5RWDBIM2HC6OIPLNUFA,1603686050179,0,True

This is a very excellent drone for the features it has!  My 10 year old son loved flying it and using the FPV feature, I didn't have to worry about him losing it or the wind taking it away.  The Ophelia Go application worked flawlessly and was fun to use.

1479,5.0,"Best drone for Beginners, so easy to use. Outstanding Customer service from Holy Stone, Good Fun!!!","I do not write many reviews, but this experience need to be shared. I have never owned a drone before and I am very happy with this one. Not only is the HS 720E a really nice drone, but the Holy Stone customer service department is outstanding which has made buying this drone a really great experience. The HS 720 E is a great choice for beginners as it has multiple features which really aid the novice flier. Among them it has a great ""return to home"" function so if you panic, can't see the drone, feel like you lost it, or otherwise , with one push of the button it will automatically return to it's launch position. It has a forward facing mode to ease with directional control as well as dual speed modes, essentially slow and normal(fast). When in slow, or beginner mode, the 720E allows you to set certain limiting parameters, such as distance and height, while you learn to better control this really fun drone. Also, the remote control is very easy to use, even for an older guy like me! There are two east to operate toggle sticks which do most of the work, up and down, forward and reverse, that's basically it, real easy. I attach my iPhone 8+ to the remote which serves as video monitor and it operates flawlessly. The 4k camera takes really great Still and video footage.  I simply could not be happier with flying this drone and capturing these amazing images. Unfortunately I had a rare and unusually thing happen with my drone, very likely caused by me and I ended up crashing the drone. In the process of crashing and falling >50 ft., one rotor arm broke. I immediately contacted Holy Stone CS and received a reply email from a gentleman named Sunny. Sunny was so very helpful and understanding. He asked many questions and tried to get a full understanding of my circumstances, and with quick replies we exchanged a few different emails. In the end, after offering numerous solutions, Holy Stone and Sunny totally took care of my situation and I am happy to report I am flying my drone again (insert big smile here). Thank you again Sunny and Holy Stones, I love this drone!!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lSunAw4FL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lSunAw4FL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lSunAw4FL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UAWdFebAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UAWdFebAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UAWdFebAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814s+LxVQgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814s+LxVQgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814s+LxVQgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81v+YdyZ+yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81v+YdyZ+yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81v+YdyZ+yL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yDZZ5NYwL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yDZZ5NYwL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yDZZ5NYwL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AG4QUHOP7ELFVXBMVCXQGM3LWYFA,1620864140574,1,True

Unfortunately even though I checked reviews on the Holy Stone HS720E 4K EIS Drone, I am so far extremely disappointed in the drone. After fully reading the owner's manual through twice, I took the drone for it's first flight. I meticulously went through the pre-flight checks and calibration process, and the drone drone performed well throughout a short range familiarization flight and return to home landing (one battery) although it missed home by around 5 feet.<br />The next day I took the drone to a local RC flying area.<br />I set up in the drone area and meticulously went through the pre-flight checks and calibration process again, it was showing 15 GPS satellites and perfect connection to the controller.<br />I pressed the take off button, the drone rose to about 5ft, a few seconds later, the drone shot off to the left at a high rate of speed (I was not even touching the control  joysticks yet) and would not respond to controls. This is a giant RC flying area with runway, but the drone area is off to the side, the drone flew about 80 feet to the left, and hit a border pine tree at a height of about 6 feet, and a estimated speed of 15 mph.  The drone flipped upside down on impact with the tree, and landed in grass.<br />There was no major damage to the drone... skuff on the top, and a few small nicks on the propellers, But had this not been in a sparsely populated side of the area, or had the drone gone the other direction, someone could have been hurt.<br />After the fact, I found at least a dozen negative reviews that described very similar, and potentially dangerous problems.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AERV2ZL4DKTJPXVWDPAAENKX434Q,1609529303618,33,True

I originally bought just to fly around and have fun, but now I think that I'll be taking a lot more pictures and videos.<br />The advanced modes like ""Follow Me"" I find useful.

1510,5.0,Awesome quality. Decent range,"[[VIDEOID:c41e3046b7b1e4d8e2f7f572a94a3e74]] The quality of the camera is the most amazing part of this camera. With the image stabilization, the videos look professional. You can't see any bobbing from the wind. Few trees make a big impact on the range. I went anywhere from 165m to about 300m. The farthest I've flow it is 500m. It doesnt seem to push past that. If the drone goes out of range, as long as you have gps on, the drone will return to home. That's wherever you launched from. The follow me and orbit mode work really well. The batteries take a long time to charge and I've never gotten them under 50%. The 1 time I did hit that, it enabled a geofence so it wouldn't be too far. Speaking of, with the app, you can set a personal geofence to make sure you dont fly too high or far.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this to everyone. Oh, also this upgraded e version comes with 2 batteries in case anyone was wondering.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711GIjL9Z8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711GIjL9Z8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711GIjL9Z8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ao-EQg3aL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ao-EQg3aL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ao-EQg3aL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFPD2K3QV3VXKWCX6DVRXC6CUPVQ,1600358985325,0,True
1511,2.0,UPDATE Has a poor camera and a lot of fun BUT NOT WORTH the price if wanting pictures or video,"The beginner mode I thought was helpful in that it operates at a much slower speed which gives time to learn the controls. the pictures looked quite shark on the cellphone but when viewed on the computer they are very soft. For video it could really use a gimble as any change in speed or direction changes the attitude of the drone, ie. head pitches down when going forward, up when stopping  or backing up. The battery charger is really slooow, 5-6hr each battery and hooking up the batteries to the charger the connection isn't very secure. Every time you shut down like when changing batteries you have to go back into your phone settings to reset the wifi which is a little confusing at first. I am lovin' it in spite of the limitations, a good buy for the money.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YM+UZh-9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YM+UZh-9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YM+UZh-9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEZ3KCICLDRMAFKYGGMG7YXKDVCA,1610589768078,0,True

However, I read the instruction booklet a few times and watched numerous YouTube videos specifically on the HS720E and got enough courage to give it a try.<br />It was easier than I thought.  This drone is extremely user friendly.  After a few more times, I will definitely test out the limits of this little guy.<br />The build quality is excellent.  You don’t feel like it’s a budget drone.  The pictures and videos you take are amazing, specially because of the EIS.  I do wish that the up and down gimbal was smoother.  It also needs a left and right gimbal.<br />I can’t wait to take this drone on my many adventures on vacation.  It’s definitely going to enhance my videos and pictures.<br />You can’t go wrong with this drone.

1514,5.0,Holystone 720E easy to fly & high quality,"I received my HS720E yesterday, on time well packaged and it sure seems to be a quality product. This is my first drone, and I gave it a maiden flight yesterday, and did not crash it, over about 35 mins of flight time. That says a lot about the controllability for a first time pilot. As long as you go slow, keep it in low speed mode, you won’t have a problem. If you start to get in trouble, just let go of the sticks, and it will stop and hover. Then you can take your time to think about how to correct the problem.<br />The drone seems to be very well engineered, and the case and controller are high quality.<br />This drone sits in a sweet spot for pricing between the more expensive drones ( you know the name) and the cheapies, with I think all of the same quality. The entry level DJI doesn’t even have “follow me mode”, this does. On my first flight I exhausted 2 batteries, and got about 35 mins of flight time. However it was extremely cold, and I think this lessened the battery longevity. Also there was sustained winds of 13 mph and gusts to 16 mph and the drone and EIS camera handled it great. No jumpy video even at those winds, which is outside its flight parameters for safe flying. If I had a complaint, it would be the phone holder on the remote controller could be a little better, and the charger is just a little of a pain to keep the batteries connected. Also I wish the batteries charged faster. But these issues are minor. When compared to the quality/price point of the drone package. I would certainly recommend to a family member. I can’t speak to the longevity of the drone . I hope it holds up well. I think it will. Plus I have heard all great things about Holystone customer service. If your on the fence, buy it, you will love it. If I need to update this review for any reason I will. Btw, this review is totally voluntary and I was not coerced in any way, and I paid for my drone.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AE6M4ROLDZ3FXWWF6772GS24I4HQ,1613140515897,0,True

However, rather than a criticism, I take it as a flight characteristic; if you wish pin-point accuracy, simply give a quick controller jab to the opposite zone to counter it.  Camera and gimbel are fantastic.  Now, don't make my batteries unavailable as my drone gets older the way Parrot did!!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHNIYDII32MDOAHDV6NDD3SM5JCA,1613336404241,0,True

I'm an amazon buyer, so of course, started looking at reviews.  I honed in on the Holy Stone line because of the reviews.  The 720 and 720E models fit my budget.  I even did some YouTube videos.  Nothing bad there.  I decided on the ""E"" model as it has an upgraded camera system.  After receiving the drone I was, and still am, impressed with the quality and fit.  A nice feature is the ability to adjust the angle of the camera in flight.  Of course this is a GPS drone.  Don't buy a drone without this feature unless you want to buy another one when you lose it or crash it beyond repair.  Did I mention it comes with two batteries. Nice.  The controller has a nice LCD screen that has all the necessary info for flight.  It also has the handy folding handles to stabilize use.  It connects to the GPS satellites very quickly and lets you know how many are connected.  I had a slight issue and contacted customer service.  That was on a Saturday and they responded the next day-Sunday.  Can't go wrong there.

1521,5.0,Impressive little drone.,"I was pleasantly impressed with this drone. As with most new toys, I took this out of the box and immediately started playing with it. Even with the partial charge on the new batteries, I got over 10 minutes of flight time, each (batteries were about 1/3ish charged). Controller and drone paired quickly and easily. Calibrations were a breeze and the app connected very fast. Performance and handling the first time was a bit slow, then I realized it defaulted to the slower ""beginner"" mode. Changed that over to normal (high) mode and this drone was an absolute dream to fly. My ONLY gripe (and this isn't the manufactures fault) is the software controlled 397ft altitude limit, but technically thats more of an FAA issue, not a Holy Stone issue. Definitely plan on buying a couple more of the HS720e drones for my kids.

1542,5.0,A Great Choice For This Serious Newbie,"[[VIDEOID:8a0d4bd9a8b329537e27a7db38de8edd]] The Video: Launch, camera movement, sideways movement, yaw, descent, and triggering Return To Home.<br />The video is from the first and second flights after getting the HS720E. I'm a total newbie to drones. Because we were excited to give it a try, we went out as soon as the batteries were charged - on the same day it arrived. The video shows the take-off from the case itself. That was a make-shift launch bad, as ours hadn't arrived yet. A launch pad is essential with this mini drone, because it sits extremely low to the ground. (Not a problem generally, but an issue on grass.) I have a photography background, and plan to manually adjust the camera settings. For this video, the camera settings are on automatic, which is how it comes out of the box.<br /><br />We were looking for a beginner's drone to see if we clicked with drones as a hobby—our 'gateway drone'. We wanted 4K and features similar to those in more advanced drones without breaking the bank. the 720E seemed too good to be true. While we've only had it for a few days, I thought I'd leave a first impressions review.<br /><br />The drone is incredibly compact. It has weight, and is much more substantially built that I expected. This is not a toy. I still can't get over the tech in the drone and what is possible through the controller and the app. Admittedly, the very first flight I flew around a lot more than I should have in the wind. Things were going great, but then I got nervous and because I had no skills I started hitting all of the buttons. It was like I was playing Tekken and just crunching down on the controller. I sent it farther than I had expected it to fly, and crashed it onto the top of a flat-roofed building. It bounced off, landed in a tree, and tumbled to the ground. I thought ""that is the most expensive first flight ever."" Incredibly, it survived with very minor battle wounds and we were in the air again within a minute. The take-off in the video is the flight right after the crash.<br /><br />Lesson learned: I'm now adopting a training regime based on the fundamentals of flying, working every day in short bits to build up muscle and brain memory.<br /><br />Recording on an SD card is simple, and the way to go. Footage downloaded to the phone is likely to have skipped frames.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to working more with this drone, taking it on trips, and experimenting with it as a creative tool. As a newbie, I am embracing drone flying as I would learning an instrument: It is a *process* - not an *event*.<br /><br />I hope this has been helpful!<br /><br />PS: Indeed, I have registered the drone, and have taken the TRUST certification. Even so, I was close enough to a building for the drone to fly over ... not a smart move on my first flight, and not recommended. :-)",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AH254URDKKC2JTUFTJ5QLIG66QPA,1658254207506,3,True

The batteries take 5-7 hours to recharge each, and they provide a duel charger BUT the duel charger only charges the batteries one at a time. So it will really take 10-14 hours to recharge both of your batteries. Something to also note... These are the type of battery you do not want to leave charging after they've fully charged, so you don't really want to just leave them overnight either.

It hovers in place perfectly and never has drifted off to one direction so far in every flight it has gone through. Holystone always has a great customer support and is always very helpful.

There are MANY drones that have the same if not better battery life and take WAY less amount of time to charge it. The technology is definitely out there for charging batteries faster. However, it does not bother me since I will just charge it overnight. Overall, this drone gets 5 stars since everything else advertised works perfectly and suits and exceeds beginner needs. It really is a great drone to help newcomers gain experience and learn the art of aerial photography. It's very portable and is definitely worth the price... Other reviews that are bad are probably are from people that don't bother reading the instructions or just got a faulty product. And like I said, customer support is very good and they will always be willing to help you just in case your drone is faulty.

Batteries barely stay on the charger and although you can plug both in at the same time, only 1 charges at a time. Each FIVE HOURS TO FULL CHARGE.

I decided I wanted to get back into drones with a decent, affordable camera drone and the HS720E fits the bill perfectly. It's very easy to fly with two modes: beginner and normal, and two speed settings. Beginner settings basically cap the height and distance you can fly, and the lower speed setting is definitely slow enough to give you confidence when learning to fly.<br />  I was initially hesitant about using an app and my phone to control the drone as I am kind of useless when it comes to phones and computer things, but the Ophelia Go app was easy to install, easy to use, and really makes the drone fun to fly. The app provides real time view from the drone's POV (really great resolution) and is the interface for accessing the settings and different flying modes (follow me, point of interest, etc...) So you really don't fly the drone from the app, that is done with the controller. My phone is an older Apple SE running IOS 14.3 and there have been no compatibility issues.<br />  I highly recommend this drone if you are looking for a high quality drone with an excellent camera for under $400.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGPNRDXMHBIMWLZSCFELKEGOOU4A,1612200237804,0,True

1607,5.0,good step up drone,I started with an HS110 to see if flying a drone was a hobby I could get into.  That was a good little drone but with no return home feature that I knew of...it can get dicey if it gets high up in the air.  It would also go off on its own at times as the calibration was hit or miss.<br /><br />So I decided to take the next step to the 720.  It took a second as the 1st drone I got was faulty.  The right rear arm was too tight at the joint and when I pulled to open it up ...the plastic just snapped.<br /><br />Ordered drone #2...faulty camera.  Was broken upon opening.<br /><br />Drone 3 came.  Finally got to test this thing out on a cold ...very windy day.  I was blown away.  So much fun.  The calibration is great.  The drone will hover in place very well.  The camera took quality pics even though I hadn't fully figured out its max capabilities.  Now I have and it's even better.  The thing really cut through the wind.  The return home feature was tested 6 or 7 times...and boom....came right back. For a new drone pilot this feature really saves the day in high altitude situations.<br /><br />I'm super happy with this upgrade.  Credit to Amazon and its return policy.

1616,5.0,5 Star Customer Service!,"First thing I would like to say before I tell the story behind the picture is that this drone absolutely blew me away! From the camera to it's flying performance, everything worked great!! Now to the story. I purchased this drone for my cinematography/photography business that just started a few weeks ago with our first client and we needed a drone to get the shots. I did my research and went with the Holy Stone HS730 because it had everything I needed for a way better price than the competition! Now I'm not a professional drone pilot by any means but I know my way around them enough to be a self sufficient flier. I also know that to get better you have to practice, so I like to take my new R/C's to the parking lot behind my house. Since school is out here it is always empty, making it the perfect place to get some drone time in without driving 20 minutes to the nearest flyable area. Like I said before, this drone worked perfectly! Easy to pair with my phone and link up to the satellites. In less than 2 minutes we were flying, unfortunately the local birds did not appreciate my practice time and attacked the drone as I was about 30 feet up in the air. One of the birds connected square with the tail end of the drone pitching it 90° straight up causing it to dive straight down to the ground... I could not believe it... Less than 3 days after receiving it, it was destroyed. I reached out to Holy Stone, sending images of the damage knowing it would be difficult to fix. I was not surprised when the Rep told me it was not repairable, so I filled out a warranty form and before I knew it, a replacement was on its way!! Today when I arrived home from work, there it was! Less than 3 days after I contacted Holy Stone, they had me my replacement!! I cannot express my gratitude enough for this!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A157nm3ffNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A157nm3ffNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A157nm3ffNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1M0390eS6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1M0390eS6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1M0390eS6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1zgjx27ACL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1zgjx27ACL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1zgjx27ACL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B101Dgss1RS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B101Dgss1RS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B101Dgss1RS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1LNp6QctCS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1LNp6QctCS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1LNp6QctCS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHPVTZ3DIRIDM42EOIZIROMITLDQ,1623701943467,2,True

1621,4.0,Great beginner drone,"This was the family's first Drone experience. It proved to be a good one. This was a great value when comparing its feature set to other drones in the price range. It feels well made, is easy to setup and comes in a great package.<br /><br />There are just a few areas that I would like to see improved. The charger is a bit lacking and doesn't make a very sturdy connection to the batteries. A quick search on Thingiverse and a 3D print later, I have a better made docking setup using the existing hardware. While on that website, I also printed a few propeller guards that snap on and fit in the included case. On the positive side, this drone seems to be picking up in popularity so there are many of these custom models and accessories for it.<br /><br />Battery life is great. I get about 21 - 23 minutes of flight time per battery, however, they do take about 5 hours to charge each. This has been a little troublesome as we are still trying to practice with the drone and it limits our usage, but it isn't a deal breaker in the least. Eventually, I'm sure I will be purchasing an additional battery.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this drone to beginners or those who are looking for a very fun to fly, small and accessible drone that's easy to grab and valued at the right price to keep it a comfortable and relatively stress free process.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHYNSU6DCJUCCACU5YLAJ6L5R44Q,1611280422372,0,True

1639,5.0,Great step-up drone (before investing $$$),"&lt;Disclaimer> You need to understand that it is $300-drone! I.e. you get what you pay for &lt;/Disclamer><br />The reason I’ve got HS720e is that I wanted fully functional drone that I can use for learning to fly (yes, I am a newbie) and didn’t want to invest a lot. Now it is a second week of my experiments – I am very happy with my decision. Here are highlights.<br /><br />Good:<br />- Remote is fine - I feel that I am in control, sticks/buttons are responsive.<br />- Sony sensor is just plain great - the image quality (both photo and video) are way better than you could expect from this price range. Plus extras: manual ISO and balance of white (if needed).<br />- Drone is heavy enough (~ 1 pound) to withstand real winds. I’ve been flying it around 300 ft above the ground with 10 mph winds (gusts up to 16mph) and it was perfectly controllable<br />- “Return to home” lands within 2 feet from the starting point (couple of times even less), so I am feeling safe about running out of power<br />- GPS hold works fine (good thing it knows about both GPS and GLONASS)<br />- Battery life is reasonable (btw, thanks for the second battery!) – I am definitely getting above 20 minutes of flight time.<br />- Optical stabilization definitely helps (good touch – lights on the bottom!)<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Beware of 5-7 hours of battery charging – just place batteries after the flight to the charger overnight, so next day you would have them full.<br />- The process of loading maps to the app is not clear enough, but I was able to figure out: start the app without connecting to drone WiFi and wait a bit – maps would be loaded eventually (at least that’s what happened in my case – Android, LG).<br />- No blade guards available to add – so you need to be careful with grass/leaves (and fingers 😊 ). I kind of solved this problem with landing pad, but still if you land on the lawn you better check blades.<br /><br />Now let’s talk about competitors… The biggest pain-point of HS720e is that it doesn’t have gimbal (only electronic image stabilization). But the models WITH gimbal are either too light (DJI Mini is 250g!) or you need to add at least extra $200 (Hubsan Zino Pro). I decided to save some money and eventually get something of the Air2/Anafi/Evo (in all cases complete package is about $1k) – but before that HS720E feels like a great starting point: I am not THAT afraid of potentially crushing it into the tree. Also it gives me a change to understand whether the whole drone piloting is for me (lots of details: FAA registration, LAANC requests, fly/no-fly zones etc).<br /><br />Summary: I hope that this work-horse will live long enough that eventually I can give it to my kids and step up to something more advance.<br /><br />P.s. I didn’t try to fly this drone indoors – I think that weight category is for outdoors-only.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K4JsxAz0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K4JsxAz0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71K4JsxAz0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aZRe4MOBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aZRe4MOBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aZRe4MOBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHPSPEYFSURLQHKHUZL5Z56NX5EA,1600050145202,150,True

1644,2.0,Worked awesome...for a while.,"I received this drone as a Christmas gift.  It worked awesome for a while and I was very satisfied.  It has 288 minutes flight time..  Until a couple days ago.  I took it out to fly, and went through all the pre flight calibration. When I launched it it took off almost straight up and then away.  All controls were completely unresponsive. It was completely out of sight and hearing..then I heard it coming back. I could finally get it to at least start decending. I couldn't get it to land but it was fairly close to the ground I pushed the emergency cut off, but it didn't respond.  The drone finally crashed into a tree and landed upside down still running.  I  pulled the battery out to kill it.  I  put fresh props on it,  put in a fresh battery in the drone and changed the battery in the controller.  Again did preflight calibration. I started the drone,  pushed the launch button.  It rose to about 5 ft and hovered.  I pushed the up stick and forward.  The drone went up then backwards hit the roof of a house  bounced off into the woods hitting a tree and crashing to the ground.  Nothing I could do with the controller made a difference.  This time one of the arms broke along with the bracket on the body.  Now I'm looking for another drone...but not another of these.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFAQ7QOBC6Z54LBCHYMSR5RJXZ2A,1653609134333,0,False
1645,3.0,Camera Quality and FPV distance lacking.,"Bought this as a starter drone for myself to get into the hobby. Controller works fine but does feel a little cheap. Phone holder can be iffy with larger sized phones but it stays put once in. Drone is automatically set to ""beginner mode"" in settings and I didn't see anywhere that said this previously so I was going to return it because it was flying like crap but once I turned it to regular it flies just fine.<br /><br />All that being said, there are 3 issues I have.<br /><br />1) The battery charger seems to only work when 1 battery is plugged in at a time. Plugging in both causes an issue where it cycles between which it wants to charge. Really not that big of a deal.<br /><br />2) There is no way in hell this drone gets 1,640 feet away from me. I start getting framerate drops and losing reception to the cell phone at maybe 600 feet. This is a HUGE problem because all you really get this way is a high up view of your surroundings and can't go anywhere else.<br /><br />3) To call the camera 4K is an overstatement. The pictures look good if you're not paying too much attention or if you don't zoom in. But I've taken many many pictures now with this and none of them are anywhere close to 4K. See attached.<br /><br />All in all it's not a bad drone. It's great for learning. The calibration is a bit of a pain but it's fine. However, don't expect to fly this thing out of your neighborhood or take any professional quality pictures with it.<br /><br />7/10.

1651,4.0,Holy Stone Does stand behind their product!,"Holy Stone contacted me after my intial review, and quickly sent a replacement for the defective drone.  I haven't had alot of time to test it yet.  But I can say that it definitely works much better than the original, and it did include the manual which was very helpful.  The problem connecting with my phone was likely due to using the wrong app, make sure to use the ""Ophelia Go"" app.<br /><br />My initial flight with the new drone was good.  I have a Mavic Mini also, and HS720E definitely is faster, and oddly even seems a little bit quieter.  I would say the camera is at least as good,  but lacks the stability part because it is not Gimbal mounted.<br /><br />I will post a more comprehensive review when I have had some more flight time, but I would like to thank Holy Stone for standing behind their product!<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Very disappoint with this drone, it has some great features for the price, and several good Youtube reviews.  First the drone came with no directions of any kind.  Even after watching Youtube videos I could not get the app to link up with the drone (Gallaxy S10).  Reviews on the App indicate that this is a common problem.<br /><br />Decided to try to fly with it with the remote, and come back to the issues with the App.  Would not hold position or altitude.  Tried two land it on a table, but the rotors wouldn't stop.  Slid across the table, hit edge, and crashed to the ground.  The rotors still would not stop, it was literally cutting my grass!  Tried to grab it and got several small cuts from the rotors, holding down the power button wouldn't even shut it off.  Finally pulled the battery.<br /><br />Tried flying it again (from a distance), after about a minute of fighting to keep it in position it started drifting to the left and could not be corrected.  Crashed into a bush, and to the ground.  After about thirty seconds of thrashing around on the ground the rotors finally stopped.

1668,5.0,Easy for Beginners,"[[VIDEOID:2825fa46d793f1bbf27503c248e3b27a]] Well Unfortunately I have to update my review.<br />after trying the drone out on my project, I decided to take it out to my property and get some aero footage. I set up take off and landing area, went through the normal setup for the drone and started my flights. The first was less than a  couple minute just went up tested controls started the drone in an automatic circle flight and landed. Next I was ready to start shooting I had my flight planed out so I could get the shots and video I wanted. I pressed the take off button the drone lifted up to about 4 feet and then just took off sideways. I was unable to control the drone at all, but still had video feed and was able to find the drone upside down in the dirt road with the props still turning. I was able to shut it down pick it up and check for damages none to be found. Thinking this may have just been a glitch with the GPS or something I went a head and set up for another test flight. This time I double check that I still had the 18 satellites found displayed on the controller I started the drone and lifted off and immediately the drone took of out of control again. I retrieved the drone cleaned it up yet again making sure to wipe off all the sensors and the camera lens I ran one more test watching the signal indicator on the controller and after seeing it shown full signal I took flight again with the same out of control experience. I am currently waiting on a response back from US.HOLYSTONE now to see if there is a resolve for this issue. Unfortunately, at this time I would suggest more research be done before purchasing this drone.<br /><br />I build commercial buildings and always wanted a drone for those pictures I cant take. I found the 720 here of Amazon and figured i would take a chance since i can return it if its not what I wanted. what I found however was a Drone that from the moment i unpacked it was super easy to set up and start flying. if you are able to see my short video you will see my very first test flight. I have never operated a drone of any kind, and the video I was able to produce was super clear, and stable. this drone has a GPS function that will help you while flying outdoors, but I want pictures inside the building where GPS has to be turned off. As a first time drone operator and the use of the simple to follow instructions that come with the drone I was up in the air shooting video within 10 mins of unboxing. I would highly suggest this drone to anyone who is thinking about getting one. Thanks for the drone Holy Stone, and Amazon.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEVOM5F2CQUQRTKZBHY2PZEEJ2JQ,1666526589964,6,True

It is now September of 2021 and maybe my 5th or 6th time using it. I started it up and collaborated the drone. The second I lift off, the drone took off on its own and crashed into a tree. I tried shutting it off and it wouldn't shut down. I tried landing it and it wouldn't follow any director the controller. It finally came out of it and I ew it around for one battery time (about 15 minutes). I changed out the battery and started the drone up again. The second tye drone lifted off it took off on its own again and crashed into the side of the house and broke one of the arms. I will not be buying this product again if it will just try and fly by itself and crash into everything.

1673,5.0,This little drone can compete with the big ones,"I bought this drone from a recommendation, It does everything that it claims. I've tested all the features and they perform flawlessly in a verity of conditions. The Return function is spot on within inches of the takeoff point. I've flown it in winds that I'm sure exceed the manufactures recommendations and again it holds altitude and track about perfect, with minimal impact on battery life. The ""follow me"" works well even if you run from it, the only issue is you can get it a little confused on with way to face the camera if you try hard enough but it sorts it out quick enough. The track feature where you draw on the map works quite well, the only thing I wish was different is you could have it not pause at each point but just fly straight through (maybe i missed it in the settings) Most importantly the auto return if you fly it out of range functions as it should every time, it is nearly impossible to lose this little guy so it would be suitable for kids or beginners.  The only negative I have for this little guy is that the camera is only 4k at 30fps, and the 4K image quality of the photos leaves a bit to be desired, that said at the price it is a small negative since it is not marketed as something for professional video....

1679,4.0,This drone is okay,[[VIDEOID:d22ab75016013784fb8fdde6d905f48]] I am not new to drones. If you were a beginner I can see were someone might think this Holy stone HS720E is good. The range on this drone is poor. Looses fpv feed and even the radio signal at only 100 meters or less away even in an open field. The follow me and circle me features are really bad. It struggles to hold a solid hover in front of you. The camera is ok if the drone is not moving. Most images have a fish bowl look to them most of the time. The camera tilt is not proportional. Videos are just choppy unless going straight or up and down slowly. The video I attached was one of the better ones. Charging batteries takes forever like 5 hours each and only charges one at a time. So enough ragging on it heres what I liked.....The case is very nice! Drone looks and feels good. Flys normal with no issues. I just never really trust it like Im just waiting for something bad to happen. I know the price seems good but im returning it and going for a DJI mini 2. I have had a couple DJI drones in the past and they were both rock solid!,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHA2TLACODUEPTCNJGQB3M77GSBA,1604901572329,15,True

1691,1.0,"Not one, but TWO broken drones","After spending several days searching for a decent drone in the $300 price range to be my first drone I determined this was the one for me. Upon arriving I was already set and ready to go with the Ophelia GO app downloaded on my Samsung S8+ and a SanDisk Extreme C10 SD card (since the reviews said that was the only way to get 4k photos and 1080p videos.<br /><br />After unboxing it everything looked and worked flawlessly, or so I thought. I inserted the SD card. I paired the device to the controller and then to my phone. I calibrated the compass and the gyros. Then I took off for the maiden flight and was thoroughly impressed with how it handled and the range of the drone. I managed about 10 minutes of flight time right out of the box before needing to start the 5 - 7 hour recharge time. I tested all the features and found they too worked great, and then brought it in to land without a single issue.<br /><br />So, up to this point you are probably wondering why I am giving a bad rating. ""You say everything works great?""...Yes, however this drone is advertised to do 4k photo and 2k video. I go to the SD card folder and find...nothing. However some 720p video is saved to my phone and 1080p photos are saved...again...to my phone. I take the SD card out and put it in my computer and find a still blank SD card. So now I have 10 minutes-ish of poor quality video.<br /><br />I assume I did something wrong so the next day I continue to tinker. I attempt to find settings (there are hardly any). I fly the drone with no phone connection and use the controller to film and video with the SD card inserted. Still to no avail I the drone will not write to the SD card.<br /><br />Once I exhausted all the troubleshooting I could think of. I purchase a 2nd drone (SG906 MAX - works perfectly and writes to my SD card btw) and then contact Holy Stone customer support. On the phone I am greeted with somebody who is VERY hard to understand and I go back and forth for about 20 minutes when I am offered a SD card from Holy Stone to try and fix the issue....2 hours later I get a call back saying they can't do that. I then send an email an go back and for for several days when it is determined the SD slot is bad I am told to return it with Amazon. I returned it and waited for the replacement. I received the replacement and it is literally a repeat of the above. I contact support again, and then go through the same run around.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this drone or this company to anybody looking for a drone that films with any decent quality. I know people have achieved 2k footage, but I have attempted 2 of these drones over multiple days and have not cracked the code other than this being a subpar device.<br /><br />Go with the SG906 MAX instead.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AH23VHAEW5YSF55N3VO2PZJQBZLA,1621539763841,5,True

1748,3.0,Spend a little more for a DJI or Hubsan,"Bought this based on reviews here and YT. This is my 3rd quadcopter and, unfortunately I am not impressed. The drone has a very nice case and the build quality is on par with more moderately priced quads. It acquires sufficient gps signal in a timely manner,  but the one I received toilet bowls after compas calibration and requires a second calibration to stabilize. It has flown off without input twice. Luckily,<br />I was able to chase it down while frantically moving the sticks to recover signal. The follow me mode is not a good feature due to the camera not being gimbal stabilized. The EIS works well for unaccelerated flight, but it pitches on its lateral axis when accelerating or deceleration, causing the camera to point up or down. The quality of the video is pretty good, but must be edited to achieve anything smooth. I have tried 2 android phones (a32 5g and s20 fe 5g) and the wifi transmission is very poor. Within 30 to 50 feet, the signal usually freezes and will return briefly.  I believe the farthest I've had a decent signal has been about 200 feet. This is unacceptable for a 300+ dollar drone. I've flown it in unobstructed areas without buildings and powerlines as well as in my yard with neighboring wifi signals and both are about the same. I'm hoping it's the ophelia app and an update will fix the mind of its own and crappy wifi.

I reached out to Holy stone and they offered to send me the replacement parts for free. I That's something you do not see every day from other company. I highly recommend Holy Stone.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />This drone eventually crash for no reason. This is a known problem with Holy Stone drones. They are known for ""toilet bowling"" and not responding to commands from the transmitter. Holy stone will send you replacement parts, but they will bribe you for good reviews in exchange of those free parts. That is unethical and unprofessional to say the least.

If you look closely, you will actually see the rain drops. I was hoping to avoid.  The weather has not been on my side during the times I have had time to fly this amazing drone.  The point of my comment is that the camera is just so crisp you can see everything.  The clarity of the camera is by far the best of all Holy Stone drones that I have purchased.  It’s the most expensive HS drone I have purchased but sooooo worth it. The flight was smooth, simple to control, and steady as can be.  In past, I have had times of nerves that I could lose control but not with this drone.<br /><br />The drone is compact when folded.  Comes in a nice carry case too. 2 batteries that give you plenty of flying time. Love the dual charger that allows you to charge both batteries simultaneously.  The remote is great too.  Feels great and the sticks are not flimsy like some other manufacturers products.  The manual is not as easy to understand like some other Holy Stone drones, but easy enough to figure out.<br /><br />I hope the weather is better for my next flight.  I will post more videos and pictures.  If you are reading my review, thank you. If you are looking for a nice, compact BRUSHLESS motor drone, if you don’t mind spending a few extra bucks over the others, I strongly recommend  the 720E. From the moment you take it out of the box to the time you fly it for the first time, you will be so happy with your purchase.

1803,5.0,Camera is great! Great beginner drone! Need more batteries!,"[[VIDEOID:6bbe5f471eae6525f006bf3756dc1138]] First of all, I looked for a long time at drones. I looked at many different brands, including and bigger name brand with 3 letters and I based my comparisons off of that. I wanted quality photo and video from the drone with the ability to move the camera on the remote. The 4k quality is good and the EIS helps with any jittering.<br /><br />Not wanting to pay for....the bigger name drone.... This one is by far the best choice for a beginner that wants a quality camera without the price. The EIS is hard to find in cheaper drones and the ones that have it, have the price with it for a reason. The instructions for setup and calibration are easy to understand so long as you go step by step and not skip anything. Trying to rush will only result in the drone not taking off (my own beginners knowledge shining through).<br /><br />The included case, two batteries, extra parts, and charger that will charge both batteries at the same time if left overnight are great additions for the cost. The case is hard plastic rubber construction. So it is sturdy enough to protect the drone, but not so much to be tossed around like hard case luggage. It is molded to keep items in place and the top lid holds all miscellaneous items. Even has room for a spare smartphone and charging brick for on the go traveling.<br /><br />You WILL have to provide your own usb power adapter, SD card to be able to save anything at all and a landing pad if you plan on landing or taking off in semi tall grass. All these items are pretty inexpensive and worth it to buy on your own.<br /><br />Connecting a phone (Galaxy S9+) was pretty simple, once I took off the case. Using the remote with phone was nice and not too overwhelming to hold. I recommend reading the instructions each time just to make sure you are getting a routine down as it does ask you to calibrate between each battery change or initial startup.<br /><br />Pressing the return home button was surprising as it started to fly up, instead of down. I learned that it flies higher to get better signal and then comes back down. It will land within a 2ft radius of where it took off from. So landing on a landing pad will take some practice from the operator to correct the minor adjustments needed. I am pleased to learn that though.<br /><br />My only gripe is the batteries charge slowly. I mean SLOWLY! 3-5 hours for one battery. Yes the charger holds two batteries, but charges one at a time. When one finishes the other will start.... Hence charge at night for less anxiety or go buy more batteries and another charger for more fun time!<br /><br />I am still learning, but I wanted to post a review since I am starting to get used to it and I wanted to show a video and a few pictures, one taken by the drone and others of the drone itself. On my phone both the drone shots have great quality, hopefully Amazon doesn't skimp out on the upload.<br /><br />Overall, it was worth waiting for the lightning deal to try this out.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8169PzkZAdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8169PzkZAdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8169PzkZAdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R+3AJ25UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R+3AJ25UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81R+3AJ25UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9111HdhNYUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9111HdhNYUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9111HdhNYUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91YUAhdNIXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91YUAhdNIXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91YUAhdNIXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEWWEZQNOEVAJ6DVVLBBIYP26ZRA,1606541253838,0,True

The market leader in the segment of compact folding quadcopter drone cameras is the DJI Mini2, but for my purposes, given what I wanted to be able to do with it, not having a 'follow-me' feature was a deal-breaker, especially considering the near $500 price after taxes. That's when I found that there were actually quite a few drones available in the ""under $300"" category. Of these, several received favorable reviews, but here's what sets  the HS720E apart from the rest for me:<br /><br />The HS720E has a 4K UHD camera. There are plenty of those available in this price range. Many of them take 4K photos, but only 2K or 1080p video. The HS720E does video at 4K(UHD) with 30 frames per second, or 1080p(HD) at 60fps, which will allow you to produce HD slow motion video if that's what you want.<br /><br />Better camera drones mount  the lens on a 2 or 3-axis gimbal to stabilize the image when the drone gets gets buffeted by wind. The HS720E camera uses Sony image sensors and has Electronic Image Stabilization. I've seen video recorded with cameras without Image Stabilization, and the difference in quality is night and day - the nominal cost difference to get this feature is definately worth it, and in my view, makes a mechanical gimbal assembly unnecessary, which eliminates a possible point of mechanical failure.  I've read more than a few reviews of drone cameras with 2 and 3-way gimbal systems complaining that the gimbal is stuck at an odd angle, or that the entire assembly broke following a hard landing... no thank you!<br /><br />To get that great resolution, you need the drone to save its' camera output to an onboard class 10 micro-SD card. Yes, the photos and video feed are also transmitted by wi-fi to the smartphone, but that's going to be at a reduced resolution. HolyStone has increased the microSD card capacity from 32Gb on their HS720 to 128Gb on the 720E. You would think that 32Gb is a ton of storage space, but those 4K video files get very large, very fast... another worthwhile improvement, and the additional cost to buy a 128Gb card instead of a 32 or 64Gb card is negligible.<br />Talking about the product's features is meaningless unless the features translate into real benefits. With the HS720E, the benefits - aside from how much fun it is to fly - are the absolutely stunning videos and still photos that I've been able to take with each flight. Are they as good as what you would get with a professional quality drone that would cost at least $1,500? Maybe not to an expert's eye - but they come pretty close, and are damned impressive considering the price of the HS720E.<br /><br />As this is my first drone, I can't personally compare the flying experience with other drones. But - I've had the HS720E for almost a month now, and I've been really happy with its performance. I've tested each of the available features (follow-me, waypoints/tap-to-fly, etc.) and they all work perfectly. I've tested the transmission range and found it to be just as documented on the website and in the manual. The flying time on a fully charged battery is just as advertised. When the drone detects that the power level has dropped below 20%, it automatically enters return to home mode (RTH), climbing to a pre-set altitude to avoid any potential obstacles, returning to a point above where it took off from, and then descending to a smooth controlled landing, within a few feet of the take-off point, if not right on the spot.  The same thing will happen if the drone loses its wi-fi connection with the remote control unit... but the drone can, and will resume the connection if, for instance, the operating range is exceeded and then reduced as the drone makes its way back to you - you can cancel the RTH function and resume flying with the remote conrol.<br /><br />Finally, while there are several drones on the market with similar feature sets at around the same price point, HolyStone's customer service performance sets them apart. I read reviews for other drones where the users were grateful to receive an answer to their email within 24 hours... and that was the extent of their interaction with those companies. HolyStone has a toll free customer service / tech support phone line, a website with a chat function, and of course, email. They answer their emails within a couple of hours max - usually less, and if you just really need to have a back and forth conversation with a live human, well -  I've made a couple of calls to their help line and have never even had to wait on hold before a live rep answers. This is important, because flying a drone can be tricky. Questions will come up... Hopefully problems won't occur... But in either case good customer service is priceless, and HolyStone definately checks that box. There's a bewildering number of choice out there, but after almost a month of experience with the HS720E, I am satisfied that I made the right choice.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AG2U24N6EAMB3BSJO7URRGYOEU5A,1611862648296,30,True

Download one of the drone apps. like airmap. Find out if your in a restricted area. If you  live in a city or near a big airport you may have to travel to fly your drone.

1844,5.0,"Full-featured, stable, and fun to fly.  My first drone - and am not disappointed !","I have had the Holy Stone HS720E drone for a year - my first drone.  Before I flew it for the first time I made sure to carefully study the manual (well-written) and watched a number of YouTube videos about ""getting started with the Holy Stone drone"".  It has been easy to use, fun to fly and responds well in winds.  I have not yet tried the ""follow me"" or the pre plotted course features and have used it mostly for capturing views around our boat and shoreline views (we live in Southeast Alaska).<br />However - more importantly is the response and service from Holy Stone.  I finally made a control mistake and flew the drone into a tree, much to my embarrassment and broke a left rear arm.  In short, I worked directly with Holy Stone in Chino, California - specifically Cari - who walked me through the process for getting the drone repaired.  Daily emails to check in and help, and if there was more than a delay lag on my end, there was an automated email just ""checking in"".  Nothing but compliments for their service - and the drone is great !!<br />Final comment - since owning the Holy Stone, which was a gift - I've read reviews on other drones and other features.  Price / features and performance of the Holy Stone make it a great buy that will not disappoint.

Its also dangerous to fly.  It decides to go crazy and fly off in a different direction for no reason.  It also one time just all of a sudden came towards me and I tried to jump away from it and the propeller cut my forehead.  I know how to fly these things but this randomly one out of the blue has a mind of its own.  And when its up in the air about 200 ft it likes to drift off in one direction then when it comes back home its way off.  So yea I was excited to get this based off other reviews.  But its a terrible drone.  And theres other reviews out there that have the same issues.,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AH5RFZB6VHMDIHD2RTRAEX2JT3GA,1673306578075,0,True

The agents of Holy Stone were kind to investigate in detail the facts, at the beginning I didn't understand what had happened, they answered the emails in less than 24 hrs., they decided to replace me for this occasion the drone.<br />For amateurs I suggest first putting some labels or stripes of strong color on the sides of the drone for cloudy days, and another label below with your name and phone and offer a reward for these cases. They are improving their models very quickly; I am grateful for the excellent service and attention of Holy Stone.

1852,4.0,The drone can fly but has issues with Wifi connectivity,"The drone itself is really nice and the controls work really well. The problem I have with it is the wifi connection. Every time I try to connect to its wifi it would either disconnect right after take off or within 30-40 meters which means I can't use the camera features to take photos or videos. I find this to be the most important part in having a drone because I want to take pictures over 200 meters. I have seen many review videos that shows how well it can fly and record footage but for me I haven't had the best luck with it. I contacted support and they do give really good advice and are really helpful but nothing has changed on my side which include trying airplane mode, reinstalling Ophelia Go and M RC Pro apps, trying different mobile devices, and recalibrating the drone per flight. It may seem like a lot but it really isn't a long process. Its just very tedious in doing these tasks every time. I would still recommend this drone to all beginner flier who wants to try out a really good drone considering that I am one too, but just be aware of its functions.

1863,5.0,Great photography and videography Drone!,"First of all, this is not a toy. This is a legit photography/videography drone with great capabilities.<br /><br />Ill review this with my standard pro/cons<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Really easy to charge, setup and use. The batteries are charged with a standard USB-C cable, and they charge surprisingly quick<br /><br />- The packaging that the drone comes in is phenomenal! The case can be used to take the drone and everything you need for it with you. This is a HUGE plus since my other professional photography drones (Mavic/Phantom) either come with a terrible case or no case at all.<br /><br />- The form factor and material quality of the drone is what you would expect from a high end photography drone.<br /><br />- The camera quality is really good, especially for its price.<br /><br />- The App is really intuitive, and is really easy to setup<br /><br />- The flight capabilities were really good<br /><br />- It has a light that is really helpful at night<br /><br />Overall, its a really good drone.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br /> - The Drone controller uses AA batteries. Its actually not a huge deal since we have high capacity rechargeable batteries. With that said, this is also helpful on long flights since I have had my other drone controllers run out of battery and you cant easily change those out.<br /><br />- There are no front or side sensors - This is something that I got used to as a safety feature, but as long as you follow protocol and fly forward and away from objects you'll be fine. Thats the one thing that successful drone pilots have to master which is go forward. If you need to turn, dont go sideways, turn the direction until you see where you want to go and move forward.<br /><br />- Range for my unit felt short (~ 1 mile), but the return to home and GPS features actually worked great when I tested the range. One thing I will stress is that you should not fly your drone out further than you can see it.<br /><br />Overall, this drone is absolutely a bargain for the price. it has most of the features of the drones that are 3-4x its price in a package that just works well.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFRJPTZJ7XHA26FAC4LNVE5SAYTQ,1600091583537,3,True

I use the Drone for fun, but will use it to spot wildlife in Alaska. All in all, I like the Holy Stone HS 720.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFT3XVNN5RVJJDOY2VMNSZXQBPBQ,1627780149158,0,True
1867,4.0,"Good Drone, Not Great Charger",This is my first drone and I'm still learning how to use it but it seems to be generally fine.  I've put it into bushes twice while trying to use the follow me feature and haven't broken anything yet so it seems robust enough.  I like the carrying case and how everything folds up compactly.  One issue though is that the charging station is flimsy.  The battery basically rests on the elements and it's quite easy to dislodge them.  Haven't seen any arcing but I suppose that could happen and why it tells you not to charge on anything remotely flammable.  I had originally thought I might charge them on the go and that isn't possible.  Also have to shield it from the cat.  Having a chamber like what is in the drone where you can snap the battery into place seems like a better design.<br /><br />I'd like to be able to set the defaults lower than what is currently possible.  10 Ft max elevation would be fine for me right now.  The mobile phone support board holder could be longer for me.  My case is somewhat rounded so the support only reaches half way across the case and is somewhat precarious.  I have a clasp on a tripod with the same issue so It's not something specific to this drone.  I do have a belt clasp on the case that I think will attach so I will try that next time.,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHA4W5QUJVRHTISA5TWNCXS232JQ,1616963772829,0,True
1868,4.0,Excellent quality and performance. No reservations.,"After a few years away from drone tech, I got a HS510, which was a lot of fun, but soon left me feeling like I wanted a little more muscle.<br />I recently started with the HS720E, and after getting a feel for it, I really couldn't be more satisfied with the upgrade.<br />It was a natural transition with regard to control and function. The performance difference is amazing and puts me exactly where I feel like I'm at with my current skills, with plenty of room to progress.<br />I would caution that this is powerful and responsive device, and will allow you to fly outside of your comfort zone if that's what you do, intentionally or otherwise. That being said, the 720E is a pleasure to drive, and I get cranky if I don't get to put it in the air daily.<br />The drone body is substantial and very solidly constructed. Nothing flimsy about it whatsoever.<br />The remote be familiar familiar if you've used a Holy Stone device previously. The camera quality surprised me. The ""E"" is for electronic image stabilization I believe, and that bears out with rock solid stills and video.<br />I'm gonna stop running my mouth and go fly.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ch51OxKWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ch51OxKWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ch51OxKWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lA-ydkq5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lA-ydkq5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lA-ydkq5L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFDCVYK6KLPZRRXZG33C5IUZHV6Q,1619543105019,0,True

I was looking to add something a little more compact and travel friendly. I decided to take the plunge and go for the HS720e and it has exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />What I love:<br />- Rock Solid Camera. Holy Stone really hit it out of the park with their new electronic image stabilization. The photos are excellent and the video rivals stuff from more expensive drones. I feel like I am able to take videos that are similar to more expensive drones.<br />-The controller fits my big hands perfect. I felt comfortable flying for 45+ minutes. The display is easy to read and very user friendly.<br />- The smooth flying no matter what conditions. Even on slightly windy days the drone would stay at altitude and not move.<br />-The return to home feature worked perfect every time. Sometimes drone companies advertise this feature but then it doesn't work as designed.<br />-I really love the carrying case they supply with the drone. It is very compact and holds all your accessories very well. I felt that if i dropped the case my drone would be protected.<br />- Holy stone's app was very simple to use. With a view clicks I was ready to go. I also appreciate the feature where it tells you what stage your in during calibration<br /><br />Things I disliked:<br />- I found almost no dislikes. My one complaint is the time to charge the battery. It really isn't much of a huge deal because this package comes with two batteries. I charge both batteries overnight while I sleep and by morning they are good to go.<br /><br />I am very eager to keep exploring with the 720E. When I am done flying with my two batteries I always feel like I am ready to get back out there. I also let two of my friends fly who are both novices. They could not believe how simple it was to operate this drone.<br /><br />Last but not least I feel the need to touch on how highly I think of HS Customer Service. They are literally available all the time to answer any questions I've had. It's nice knowing that the manufacturer is involved and always has your back.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615+Z-F28tL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615+Z-F28tL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615+Z-F28tL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61szLTbUiQL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61szLTbUiQL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61szLTbUiQL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGU6WFVIKERFHFQKIG527GQMMQIA,1601258268808,1,True

1905,4.0,Good drone for the price as long as it works as advertised.,"I've only flown this drone once. It was windy, cold and I was impressed by how it handled the wind. I only got it to about 800ft when I lost connectivity. I believe that has something to do with the app I was using. Back to the drone, it appears to be put together nicely. It came in nice packaging. The battery charger could use some work. The batteries are very loose when plugged in and it takes about 5 hrs to charge. On my second flight the drone took off on me and crashed into my neighbors garage door at high speed. I thought for sure I would find it in a heap, broken. To my surprise it was only scuffed in places. I even tried it again and this time, no problems. Whether it was user error or the drone/app, I don't know at this time.

1907,4.0,Fun to fly. Stable,"I love this drone. It's a reliable GPS drone that I can trust when letting up on the sticks. It will drift on ya at times, so keep it away from obstacles. Trees and walls tend to suck this drone towards 'em, so don't do any precision flying. It's a sturdy flier that can take some wind due to it's heavy feel. It looks good hovering in front of you and is not very noisy. The EIS was the selling point for me, and you will get smoother videos without to much shaking. Hard stops will be very noticeable. The video quality? Well, I'm not thrilled, but it is better than most drones less than $400.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quiet brushless motors<br />EIS<br />Great stability<br />Range<br />Quality materials and construction<br />Long battery life<br />Easy to calibrate<br />Great Customer Support<br /><br />Cons:<br />Drifting will get you in trouble<br />So keep it away from things<br />The video and pics are just OK<br />Price point is a bit too high.

1912,4.0,Great Drone with Good Features!,"After researching some camera drones to try FPV, take pictures and videos, I decided to give this company a chance.  I did not want to spend a whole lot of money, but I believe this one makes a great drone to start off with.  It is easy to bind with your smartphone and controller, once you learn how to do it.  It is easy to control and the video feed is good.  The design looks really nice and the construction is really solid and durable.  As an example of its durability, the 2nd time that I took it out, it was flying normally for about 15 minutes and then all of a sudden it seemed to lose propulsion and dropped from about 4 feet into the hard cement ground.  At that moment, I thought the drone was done and would not function any more.  Upon inspection, it sustained some scratches on the top of the body and the props (surprisingly still intact, which I thought they were gonna snap since it hit the ground so hard!)  I rebinded it to the controller and my iphone and it still flew and the camera was still functional!  I just hope it continues to function properly, but so far so good.  Overall, I'm happy with this drone and I hope to take it out more and enjoy different locations from a bird's eye view!",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEZ4RUUBMFGNPFYZLCXZIZWYR7XQ,1609996433942,0,True

1939,5.0,Excellent drone for the money,"This is the first drone I ever purchased, and it was simple enough for me to learn how to fly it very quickly. This drone has a 4K camera as well as GPS, auto return to home, follow me mode, and waypoint mode.<br /><br />Helpful specs from my usage:<br />Max range: 800 - 1000 feet (my typical experience)<br />Max height: 390 - 394 feet<br />Flight time: 18 minutes of regular flight, 3 more of low battery flight (21 total minutes, windy conditions)<br />Charging time: 5hr minimum, may be up to 7 at times if both the batteries are completely drained<br /><br />You can anticipate getting at least 20 total minutes of flight time in normal flying conditions. It enters low battery mode at about 18 minutes and promptly returns to the proximity of its take-off point. It will want to auto-land immediately, however you can override it’s urge to land for about 3 minutes, at which point it will automatically land within 18 inches of its takeoff point. In low battery mode the drone reduces flight height to 98 feet and within 328 feet of its take-off point (home).<br /><br /> This drone is incredibly stable and can hover in winds of 30 to 35mph, which is truly surprising considering the price point of this drone. It’s maximum flight height is around 394 feet. Also, be aware that this drone can reach speeds of about 40mph so don’t fly it wide-open for more than a few seconds as it will immediately leave range of the controller. The drones functional control range is approximately 800 to 1000 feet under most flying conditions. If you are flying near buildings or dense tree coverage like forests, this range becomes reduced to about 350 feet. Also, the higher the wind speed the shorter the control distance. When I flew it in 35mph winds and nothing overhead my range was reduced to about 400 feet. It gains altitude quickly, approximately 30 seconds to reach its maximum elevation (390 to 394 feet). Descending back to the ground takes longer, about 1 minute. The only thing I would want to change about the drone is the charging time on the batteries, which is 5 to 7 hours.

After flying it a bunch of times (maybe 20 times) and really getting the hang of the drone, one day I took it out, calibrated it, waited for 10+ GPS signals (like I always do), took off, it hovered then it just flew erratically into the side of my house and crashed. I returned the drone to Amazon and purchased another thinking it was just a glitch.<br /><br />Second drove, I opened the box, charged up the batteries, connected the app/drone to my iPhone, calibrated to the remote control, waited again for 10+ GPS signal, took it off, maiden flight on this one out of the box, it hovered about 5 feet then started going into “point of interest” flight. I had to go up in altitude or it was going to go into trees and houses. I pressed the “return to home button” on the app and the controller, but it still did “orbit” flight while descending and not coming anywhere close to me. Kept orbiting and drifting northward, away from me. I had to change the controller mode from low to high and back to low, but finally was able to gain somewhat control for it to fly back to me and I successfully landed it in my driveway, not crashing into anything. I attempted 3 more flights, all of them taking off erratically, and I was prepared to immediately press the land button, only for it to land while drifting and having to press the land button again for the propellers to stop.<br /><br />I am done with Holy Stone…time to spend a little more money and just get the Mavic Air 2.

Once I received the drone I can not wait to take it out and try it.  My first impression of the drone is that it is a well built drone with a good list of the functions- useful flight mode such as Follow me and Orbit flight.  It also equipped with 4K video quality and electronic stabilization imaging function.  Recently I took my newly purchased Holy Stone HS720E GPS model drone for a test flight I have a lot of fun doing that. The two batteries come with the bundle have combined ~56 minutes which is plenty to have some fun time.  I'm still testing other function and will return to update my review.

The storage case is also very nice.<br /><br />Controller:  A typical controller for a beginner’s drone. Easy to learn and use.<br /><br />App:  Learning to use the App with my iPhone 11 Pro was straight forward. However, the text and icons font on the iPhone display is very small and difficult to read especially in bright sunlight.<br /><br />Battery Charging:  The charging system user interface is very sparse. You are unable to determine the exact charge condition of the batteries except for fully charged. The connection between the batteries and charger is not secure. I have to use rubber bands to help hold the batteries to the charger connection. A major issue is the charging time of 5 to 6 hours per battery, which can only be charged one at a time. The instructions tell you to be present while charging. With two batteries, this makes it very inconvenient to be present for 10 hours or more.<br /><br />The package comes with two batteries, a very nice feature.<br /><br />Documentation:  The instruction manual for the drone and app is very sparse but adequate to get you in the air. I would like to have more details in the instructions.

Not sure if it became self aware and flew home, but $300 bucks for 2 flights and about ten minutes of use is just not worth it.

Once I read through the instructions, it was very easy to use. I do recommend looking up a YouTube video on how to use for the very first time. I have flown it numerous times and get better at flying each time. The nice part is that you don’t have to control it every second - it hovers when you’re not moving it and does well in light wind.

2052,5.0,"Holy Stone HS720E --- Great drone, exceptional value, quick customer support.","First the BAD: I didn’t notice it at first but the seals on the Holy Stone box had been taped over with clear tape. When unboxing the actual drone I noticed a couple of things that caused concern. There was damage to some of the propellers, scratches on the drone body, the main drone batteries were already charged and there were already batteries in the transmitter. This unit had definitely been returned and never checked out properly before reselling. The spare battery, charger and misc. extras had also been opened. I had just purchased a used drone and paid for new.<br /><br />Because I initially thought the Holy Stone box still had its clear seals I contacted Holy Stone support first. They quickly got back to me with how to proceed to get a new replacement from Amazon. As always there was “no questions asked” from Amazon. They immediately sent out a replacement and I don’t even have to box and ship the first one back. I just drop it off at the nearest Kohl’s store.<br /><br />The GOOD: This is my first drone and I did a lot of research before buying the Holy Stone HS720E. Price was of course a concern but this drone had many features that were available in much higher priced drones. A big plus for me was that there are many HS720E specific YouTube videos available for setup, calibration, and flying. Also there are videos for use of the various transmitter functions and the Ophelia Go App.<br /><br />I’ve only been able to fly it a few times since receiving it because of bad weather in the area but so far I love it. It's an easy drone to fly. It's remarkably stable, the GPS works well, and the video is great. The manual is very well written and easy to understand. The drone and the provided case have a quality feel.<br />Many reviews and research indicated Holy Stone has the best customer service and I’ve only had this limited experience, but so far I would agree. It is nice to know they stand behind their products. I really like this drone and think it is an awesome buy, especially for the price. I will be doing more business with this company for sure!<br /><br />Amazon!

Another hour of flying and the drone almost feels like a familiar race video game.  The only negative is the camera does not auto position on the subject in Follow Me Mode, but maybe I’m just missing some nuance.  If you don’t have lots of extra time or energy to spare and want to ensure you are out enjoying a drone lickity split, this is the one to get.  And the battery feels like closer to half an hour, awesome since some said closer to 20-23 minutes, which was the one concern I had with not really being able to enjoy flights before the battery gets drained.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AGI3P7RLNKAWGM37NH4Q4TG4IH4Q,1608521161506,1,True

The drone is super stable and so easy to control. the only thing I have noticed so far is the ""follow me"" mode is not the best and lags behind and does not necessarily keep you centered in the camera view, sort of bummed, because this is why I bought it.  I have not had the chance to test the other modes of flight yet, but ill assume they'll do fine. Camera is decent, but the gimble adjustment is a little touchy and hard to find the right angel for the camera, this may be due to lag between the drone and the controller.  Overall, I would highly recommend this as a beginner drone.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AHXGPVRXCDSXR4XHIIAOLMOE5GVA,1602863592558,0,True

2111,4.0,Great Starter Drone!,"Was my first drone ever and it was very user friendly. It takes great video and the electronic stabilization works very well, I do recommend it providing you don’t need a lot of speed/altitude from it. Including the coupon this drone comes with two batteries and a dual charger at a sub $300 price point.<br /><br />After some light research I landed on this drone by google’ing “best drones for fishing”, that was my mistake. This drone had issues with signal loss at what I thought to be short distances, thankfully the RTH worked great and I didn’t lose the drone. Holy Stone also has great tech support and they agreed that I may have ended up with a bad unit and offered to replace it or return it with no hassle. I opted for the refund and they even offered an additional discount if I would consider trying them out again in the future.<br /><br />If you’re curious I ended up with a DJI Phantom drone, much faster and much better range but also 4 times the cost. Two additional DJI smart batteries cost as much as this HS720E drone kit.

I did, only because of user error, almost loose it in a swamp. My error was I didn’t calibrate it correctly before flight. As soon as it went up it took off horizontally and I barely fought it back and it ended up hitting the back of my camper and crash landing. But it didn’t damage anything. I was able to restart it, recalibrate it and back up and running. I would recommend this drone to anyone looking to get into flying them.

The range with video doesn't seem extremely far; however, we are using an old iphone 6 with it.  I am sure a newer phone would maintaing a connection for a greater distance.  Also, I did download the app on my note 9.  The app with Android appears to be better.  We had some weird glitches with the iphone where an error message would pop up in chinese.  However, it only did that a few times.  It gives an error message at the beginning about connecting the phone via WiFi.  I can't tell what they mean in the message, but connecting your phone to the Holy Stone wifi in your WiFi settings is the easiest way.

The image stabilization makes the videos looks super smooth. I've just started playing with it and already I can't believe how easy it is to fly. I bought it to inspect my gutters and needed a camera that could point straight down. The remote 90 degree camera movement is very smooth, not jerky. It's so easy to control. Once I get some practice, I'll be able to get closer to my gutters, but already I was able to get great shots of where my gutters need cleaning. I live in Florida, so if we get hit with a hurricane, I'll be able to inspect my roof for damage and send pics to the insurance company. Besides, this thing is very fun to fly.<br /><br />The pics are screenshots off my iphone, so don't judge the image quality. I'm getting a micro SD card to save the 4K videos and photos. The images will be crystal clear off the SD card.<br /><br />I shopped around, watching a lot of youtube reviews. I didn't want to spend $500+ for a drone. This one was half that. The fact it came with a nice case and second battery sealed the deal. I saw a few reviews comparing it to other drones costing $500-$900. That's not a fair comparison.

I replaced my damaged propellers,(included) and flew again. The drone was much more stable, and flew better. I will buy some extra props. I think it would help if Holly Stone had a digital manual. The paper manual included is kind of small. Customers need to know that there is a tab on the lower part of the phone holder that will securely hold your phone after you unfold it. It holds my Galaxy s10 with an otter box case securely. This is important! You won't have a good experience if your phone keeps coming loose.  Okay. Here's what I like. You get a LOT for your money. Very nice case. It will keep your drone, and accessories safe and secure. 2 Batteries with pretty decent flight time. External controller with it's own screen that compliments your cell phone screen.

I called after having a slight issue and they immediately handled my issue.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AH75MV5CJOYOVPH32WRBYH3VB3DQ,1616159905099,0,True
2149,5.0,GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.,I had a malfunction with my drone and i lost it. After 4 days of having it this was frustrating. I contacted holy stone as a last effort after looking for drone for 7 hours with 8 close friends. They showed me some things in the app to locate my drone. Not salvageable  they sent me a new one to replace my original drone. No fuss. Just good customer service. Will recommend again.,[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AFZSVIXRWOANUD277H2PXX6H6BPA,1658233497500,0,True

2152,1.0,Uncontrollable drone.,"This drone sadly is trash I recently purchased this drone and was so excited for it charged the battery and first problem is you need aa batteries for the remote ok why not a rechargeable one. Then already ready to do a first flight here is where the problem went yup it took off great then I lost complete control the drone would not acknowledge what I wanted it to do , I was finally able to land safely. I boxed it up and called customer care for a refund. Do not buy this product.",[],B085HNMHKJ,B085HNMHKJ,AEAY24G4E6PRL5J2EVL6WNKFAQ3Q,1617590393514,0,True
