Instantly a hit, he rushes to play with them.<br /><br />Easy to use, they lock into place, making these excellent for not-quite-coordinated hands.<br /><br />In filling out the questionnaire before writing this review, Amazon asks for 1-5 stars about a few things, just as they do for any toy review. I gave each five stars:<br /><br />How much fun is this toy? Tons. My toddler can't get enough of it. I enjoy building with him.<br /><br />How would you rate this toy's educational value? He can organize them by color and shape, and thinks now like a little architect.<br /><br />How durable is this toy? Nothing has broken yet despite full body contact playing.<br /><br />How do you rate this toy overall? An enthusiastic five stars. My toddler's one regret is that there are only 100 tiles. He's like hundreds more.<br /><br />Buy the set of 100. You'll need that many to get anything done.

13,5.0,Best Toy for Chldren Ever - Invest in Them,"This is one of the best toys ever invented. I've bought so many sets (the 100 set is an essential starter kits) for children, I should be their spokesperson. But, really, girls, boys, and ADULTs  will enjoy this beautifully made set of magnetic building tiles in beautiful translucent colors. They are expensive and the price keeps going up but DON&#34;T be taken in my imitators. Magnatile magnets are strong and can be built up and up. I like to get a couple of sets at a time and then add to them for special children or families every year ( the more you have, the greater buildings can be constructed). I've never recommended this toy to anyone, who didn't end up loving it as much as I do. Spent the money: it's a worthy investment and will keep children busy for hours, creating and using their imagination and inventiveness to create new designs. My daughter with four kids probably has about eight sets and the neighbor's kids would knock on their door to ask to play with them. Equally loved by girls and boys. I keep a few sets at my house for my children visitors (and love to watch their parents also start playing with them). I can attest they last forever and are so easy to clean up, being magnetic and off several sizes: they fit back into their boxes easily.

14,5.0,Well worth the money.,"While looking for Christmas gift ideas this fall for our 3 and 5 year old boy and girl, I came across Magna Tiles. Didn't know anyone who had them, but the reviews on Amazon and across the web are outstanding. The price tag was high, but we have so many toys in this house that nobody plays with that I wanted to buy one big, quality item that I thought maybe would keep their attention.<br /><br />Magna Tiles definitely fit the bill. Since we got them at Christmas, they are played with twice a week, and probably would be played with more if they weren't in a closet. Our 5 yr old girl makes intricate designs, and our 3 yr old boy does simpler ones but still has caught on very quickly. They play well together and if they need to they will divide all the pieces up so there is no fighting. Many times it is a group effort though. Right now they are making houses for their Zhu Zhu Puppies.<br /><br />These are also very durable toys. None have been broken yet and I don't see it happening. We have a 9 month old puppy and he has no interest in chewing these because they are too hard for him to pick up, which is a bonus. If you are looking for a nice quality item that the whole family will play with and kids will enjoy together, Magna Tiles are great. There is a little learning curve at first while the children learn how to work them and how to work the magnets, but they will be learning how to build intricate designs with all the triangles included in no time!<br /><br />Edit 11/2014. These are still a hit! Kids are almost 7 & 9 now. One kiddo that comes over wants to play with these the entire time!",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AFHG2GKQJVSZMZMQ64SPRCZBGAYA,1297806008000,1,False

I personally love how compact they are. The take up so little space but can make huge constructions. I'm tempted to get a second set at this point. Get the full 100 price set to start for sure.

The tiles have pretty strong magnets and we have had no issues with building up. They have also been dropped quite a bit and no cracks in the plastic, as of yet. The box they come in is very precise as to where the pieces go so they all fit, so I purchased a separate storage bin for quicker clean up.

It's been nearly four months and my kids and I still play with them every single day. I am always amazed by the concoctions they come up with. I prefer the clear tiles over the solids, they just add more visual interest to our creations. I love the magna-tiles because they are fun, educational, durable and we get so much quality time out of creating things together as a family. They are well worth every penny.

Practically indestructible (I saw one in the street one day that had been run over by cars, brought it home and it still worked). No boundaries on imaginative play. Fantastic way to learn about how different geometric shapes can be used together. Initial set really needs more pieces, so bought this as the starter set for another child.

68,5.0,Magna-Tiles for the win!,"Magna-Tiles are awesome.  I first encountered them at a Children's Museum and was so impressed with them.  I work with toddlers, and magnets are typically a no-go for them, but these are made so well that they are safe for littles to play with!<br /><br />I bought this set for my twin nephews when they turned 3.  I see magna-tiles similar to Lego- the usage only gets better and more elaborate as kids get older.  They are now almost 5 and still love playing with them.  The tiles have held up well and I continue to add to their set.<br /><br />Magna-Tiles are a great option if you're looking for toys that don't have music, lights, or one set purpose.  I like that kids get to be creative and decide how they are going to use them, instead of being told by the toy what its function is.  There are so few toys left like this these days!  I've never known anyone who uses or plays with them to be disappointed.  Very cool idea, well made and executed, and they hold up over time!

70,5.0,"Start with 100, add 48 and 32 plus expansions","Our family (and extended family and close friends) all swear by Magna-Tiles. I first became familiar with them when my best friend's kids asked for them for one birthday and then asked for MORE tiles the following year so they wouldn't fight over them. I didn't see them in person until my son started preschool and they had them there. I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about until I actually used them.<br /><br />I started out with the 100 piece set and we loved it. I also bought this 32-piece set for travel and quickly realized that it wasn't really enough pieces to do much. The [[ASIN:B0093LSWIE Magna-Tiles 12148 Clear Colors 48 pc DX set Toy]] is also only good as an expansion pack as are the ACTUAL expansion packs.<br /><br />I found everything much cheaper on Jet.com as there aren't very frequent sales on this item. I've never tried the knockoff brands.<br /><br />The pieces are REALLY sturdy even with a destructive 20-month-old. He is not above throwing them at the wall pretty hard. We haven't had any problems despite that. I prefer the clear pieces to the solid ones if you're going for aesthetics. Are they pricey? Ridiculously so but they stick to each other well and I think they will last a really long time.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the 100 pc set makes the best travel set. Because of the odd pieces in the 48 pc, the box is much longer and bigger. And the 32 pc set isn't really great as anything more than an expansion set.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ve2O2XFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ve2O2XFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ve2O2XFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ve2O2XFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ve2O2XFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712ve2O2XFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qZfCazuVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qZfCazuVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qZfCazuVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qZfCazuVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qZfCazuVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qZfCazuVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EsPHZcM2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EsPHZcM2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EsPHZcM2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EsPHZcM2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EsPHZcM2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EsPHZcM2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AF3YEJ63COKWZNJHQ2JQP5B6AQ3A,1483269059000,8,True

But these tiles are wonderful, and we both love them equally.  When we first opened them and started building, she said she wanted to build all night long.  She is very interested in tiny figures (little dogs, Playmobil and Polly Pocket figures); and with Magna tiles, one can make an amazing colorful palace, in which each tiny figure can have his or her own apartment.  Love it!  The translucent set is definitely the way to go, because then the little figures can look out of their colorful windows, and be seen from outside.  I can also see that this toy will grow with her, there are lots of ways to play with it.  Great toy!  -- I would actually recommend it to anybody thinking of buying a castle or palace for a child.

The magnets are fully encased within the tiles so I don't have much concern about them breaking loose or posing any type of hazard.  His teachers strongly endorsed the learning potential for this learning toy- mathmetical, spacial relations, all the way down to the basics of color and shape recognition.<br /> The only drawback to this toy is the price - it is steep for those on a budget so the grandparents helped chip in on it especially after they saw how engrossed he was playing with these tiles at school.

99,2.0,Not worth the price amymore.,"My kids received 2 sets of Magna-tiles for Christmas. We went with Magna-tiles because most of the reviews stated that they had the strongest magnets, and because of that were worth the price. When we opened the box i was surprised at how not strong those magnets were!  And then my 9 year old spend a very frustrating hour trying to build that robot pictured on the example paper and couldn't.... Then I spent half an hour trying to do the same and couldn't... I am an engineer and my opinion is that the magnets are not strong enough to hold the weight of that structure. Maybe earlier when those magnets were stronger... So I went online and started researching it a little more. I came across more recent reviews that state that the magnets indeed got weaker in Magna-tiles. I sent an email to customer service and the answer basically was that the magnets are adequate, they do what they need to do and the robot takes practice. Ok then. I am giving it 3 stars because it is still a good toy but given weaker magnets, very limited shapes and high cost it is simply not worth the higher price anymore. There are other similar toys out there now that are superior to this one.<br /><br />Update: just took a star away because anything other than 4-6-8 sided prisms collapses. We tried to build a couple of stuctures kids build using playmags and can't: the magnets of the new magna-tiles aren't strong enough.

104,5.0,"Fun, durable, and entertaining toy for all ages!!","You know a toy is pretty special if it can withstand the pounding of little hands at a daycare.  I was intrigued when I saw these at multiple daycare centers I visited.  Every day that I would pick up my son, he was playing with them, and I wanted to get a set for home, but they were so darn expensive!<br /><br />So we got some cheaper knock offs.  No. No. No. This is one situation where cheaper just won't do.  The tiles didn't line up as well, they didn't stick together as well, and just did not have the same durability. Well, four years later, I have more children, and I keep wanting to get them, so I finally do.<br /><br />I wish I had gotten them sooner.  My 2 year old twins love stacking them, and the magnets are so good that it facilitates building even by clumsy toddler hands.  The tiles are so durable that they have survived beautifully after being thrown down stairs, on tile, at windows, and at siblings.  My twins' favorite thing to do is build a tall tower then run into it, causing the tiles to crash.  Not a single scratch, chip, or other sign of wear and tear is to be seen.<br /><br />I am such a fan of these tiles that I now have 2 sets for my kids.  I know that they will be enjoyed for many more years to come, and my husband and I enjoy building with them as well.  I even bought a set for my nieces, and now that family is a big fan as well.

108,5.0,Fun For the Whole Family,"I was first introduced to Magna-Tiles in my daughter's pre-K classroom.  A group of children were huddled around a table creating all kinds of buildings with these flat plastic tiles<br /><br />There are two options on the quantities: 32 piece or 100 piece.  I feel this is an expensive toy, but the 100 piece box Is worth the splurge.  You can make more elaborate structures with 100 pieces, and, if you have two children, you will be able to split the tiles and they will both be able to make decent creations with minimal fighting over the tiles.<br /><br />In the 100 piece pack you will receive 4 large squares, 50 small squares, 11 right triangles, 20 equilateral triangles, and 15 isosceles triangles<br /><br />There are 5 colors used in the set: blue, yellow, red, purple, and green  Each tile has one or two (depending on length) strong magnets embedded in the side to allow the pieces to stick together<br /><br />My children can split these tiles and play for hours.  They have been known to build roads on which to drive their cars, elaborate garages to store their cars, beds for their princesses to sleep on, and towers to see how high they can go before the pieces come tumbling down.  We’ve had these tiles for five years and the children still play with them.<br /><br />This is a fun addition to the building toys (legos, duplos, wooden blocks) we already have.  I really like how the magnets help the tiles snap together.  This is a five-star toy and the entire family enjoys playing with it.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AGK3HHFSEPYAONGRU4PCM5PEIDMQ,1397540771000,1,False

This is the first time I experienced something like this: a company expecting the customer to pay for the S&H costs of a faulty product.

So I was VERY excited to purchase magna tiles to add to our play. I waited a long time to buy them as they are an expensive toy and I wanted to introduce them at a good age. I have a 3 year old that I thought was ready for these.<br /><br />Magna tiles are the brand that everyone says is the best quality. They’re also the highest priced.<br /><br />These were EXTREMELY disappointing. First of all, any toy that is in the over $100 range should at least be of a solid construction, quality and usability. The magnets don’t line up, the negative sides don’t connect properly (even though this brand says that they do) and any constructions immediately collapse or topple. They are not sturdy at all. I was extremely frustrated after 5 minutes of use. My 3 year old can/will build flat structures (that’s the only way they work properly) but the price point is supposed to support 3D building. It doesn’t.<br /><br />I’m baffled as to why this brand receives so many accolades. It’s a terrible quality for the price point. I also bought an expansion and I’m planning to send both this one and the expansion back.

Also my younger son has been playing with it since he was 18 months old. Together they play with it every day for hours building ""garages"" or ""racetracks"" for their hot wheels toys, ""castles"" with their little green soldiers, ""spaceships"", etc... You can use them to also ""teach"" colors. We shine a flashlight and place two clear color tiles to see what color they make. Kids love to build them and place a lantern in them to see it glow in the dark when lights go off. We take it everywhere for vacation. When family and friends come over it's the first toy that gets pulled out. Our nephews and neighbors in age from 3-13 years old. They all love it also.

She saw them at a museum (think it's genius that they have these for kids) -the children just love them and their endless patterns are fascinating to make and beautiful to look at.<br /><br />She's almost 8 by the way and she still enjoys playing with them. The brilliant colors and the ease of building and collapsing capability make these an all-around winner.<br /><br />I think that the capability of this toy goes beyond pretend play, as in math skills and such. But I just wanted to add that my kid likes to make play houses and put her My Little Ponies in them too.<br /><br />Best yet, they ""hold"" their value....they can be resold at e-auctions for pretty darned close to what you paid for them. So don't pay too much. My advice: shop around.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AEEJXJFDOZHMRHI7CNSTEX77XXWA,1383929862000,2,False

214,5.0,Piece of mind for the extra money,"My 3.5 year old loves building with blocks, legos, lincoln logs, etc. I used to run a daycare and one of the most popular toys at any of the daycares in our district were magnatiles. I saw really cool magnet sets that were half the price online and was tempted to purchase those brands so I could hook her up with more bang for my buck, different shapes or whatever and maybe I will in the future. I purchased these because I knew first hand after watching k-6 grade children beat the heck out of them over years and never had one crack. My 1 year old puts everything in her mouth and my fear is she'll get a magnet in her belly. I bought magnatiles because I feel confident in the construction and sturdiness of this brand that even my little Ruzillah isn't going to be able to break them. Fingers crossed. So far, they have crashed, been bashed, been thrown and it's like they are still fresh out of the package. Both girls love them and I love to build with them too so it's great to spend time together. I'll have to buy a few of the big sets over time to have enough for the cities we want to build but the big set is a good starting point. None of the pieces are small enough for my 1 year old to get down her throat. (I'm holding out on the 3D shapes because of this). Magnets are strong enough, colors are vibrant, and this new rivet feature (new to me) is added safety, or at least it seems so.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AH4VB7GPSZYMTV3SLHIZVN3KL7IQ,1598886472255,11,True

I have BGG triplets and all three love to play with them, and every kid who comes over loves them.  As my kids have gotten older, they've learned to build larger and more complex structures, and even use them to interact with other toys (e.g. building castles for figurines or bridges over railroads).  I don't see them falling out of use for years to come.  I recommend getting the translucent set as the kids like to put figurines and other toys inside their creations and want to be able to see what's inside.  I don't recommend the 32 pc set as its difficult to build much with 32 pieces and its simply not a good value.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Durable - We've never broken a piece despite being routinely stepped on, dropped, toppled, and thrown into a storage drawer.<br />* Excellent play value - Kid's play with them frequently, and for long periods of time (up to 4 hours).  The manufacturer recommends age 3+, but they're also great for kids younger than that.  The magnets are pretty strong, so they hold structures well, and the kids don't get frustrated by things falling apart.<br />* Easy to clean up and store - They're flat and magnetic, so they pick up fast, are easy to stack, and don't take up much space.  Consequently, they're the first toy my kids pick up when asked to clean their playroom.  If you're short on space and looking for a limited number of high-quality toys, this has to be at the top of your list.<br />* Safe - The magnets are completely enclosed in plastic and can't come out.<br />* Educational - You'd be surprised what can be made out of them.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Not cheap - Sometimes you just gotta pay for the good stuff.  They're still a great value, though.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AE25LXHFCXYRZ6N3OLQZF7NPPDTA,1265412304000,77,True

340,5.0,Compared to Playmags,"Magnatiles are THE name brand. You can count on them being the safest in terms of chemical make up (BPA free, lead free, etc...). They have rivets and not just glue to keep the magnets in.<br />They have a wide assortment of colors, especially with various sets. They have fun pieces like doors and stairs. Their isosceles triangles actually make perfect circles, unlike many other brands.<br /><br />Cons would be that they’re expensive. Their magnets are also smaller than some newer brands have released.<br /><br />I’m adding pics comparing to Playmags; Playmags have larger magnets. However, Playmags isosceles triangles can’t form circles, thus no pretend pizzas, cakes, pies, etc. Playmags are cheaper, but they’re also not very forthright on chemical makeup.<br /><br />Magnatiles are stronger than Picasso, and have the rivets in the corner for extra durability unlike Picasso.<br /><br />Don’t go for obscure off brands when it comes to magnets for toys, as they can pose a safety hazard.<br /><br />Magnetic Tiles are super fun for kids. Heck, even for adults. It’s the first toy that really brought out independent play at our house, and they’re so open ended. I’d suggest a minimum of 100 pieces per child.<br /><br />There’s a Magnetic Tiles Ideas group on FB to get and share building ideas.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ErGmypMWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ErGmypMWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1ErGmypMWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1iSetrzgiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1iSetrzgiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1iSetrzgiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1vRFgLfjWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1vRFgLfjWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1vRFgLfjWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1wFTk1pM6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1wFTk1pM6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1wFTk1pM6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AFBDNCHPEXZARUFDXPWX5IGWRYIQ,1609189360595,0,False

The first night my 6 years old stayed up till midnight playing the Magna Tiles.  And he is the one that is usually running around making noise and breaking things.  Apparently all it took was the right toy and we can see what we thought was true before. He has an exceptional awareness in building and attention to detail.  The rest of the boys, our 3 years old and 23 month old twins are having fun playing with what our eldest makes and they build something as well.  From space ships, cars, houses, castles, different designs and such.  You can make mazes pretty quickly and they can have fun breaking the design and building it right up.  The little ones are still puzzled how they stick together, but they will catch on soon enough..  We love this toy!

391,5.0,Easy clean up STEM toy,These are amazing STEM toys. I love how creative kids can be and the huge plus is that they are SOOO easy to clean up since they’re magnetic.

394,5.0,Absolutely the best toy ever!  Hands Down! A must have!,"So, how do I begin.... I suppose with some declarations<br /><br />1. I am not in any way connected to this company, although I'd like to be<br />2. I have no incentive for writing this review other than to spread good information based on my experience with these blocks<br /><br />So, my addiction with these blocks started about 2 years ago, when my son turned 1. Given, at that time he was unable to play with the two sets we had bought form a major big box retailer. The sets happened to be 25% off at that time of year and I jumped on two boxes and stored them for a bit. When my son turned 2 the blocks started being played with. Every since its been a uphill battle to not buy more pieces consistently. At this time we have 3 sets in use, approximately 300 pieces and I have two more boxes (100 pieces each) for my sons upcoming birthday, which will put us over 500 pieces.  So why are these blocks so important to our lives you ask? Why invest so much money on these blocks?  Please allow me to answer in a multi-tiered fashion.<br /><br />Cost:<br />These blocks are not expensive, not for when you think about the cost associate with one dinner for a family of 3. Go to your RedLibster or go to AliveGarden one night and tell me how much you spend. Oh.. you spent a 100 bucks on some pasta and breadsticks great... you could have had a toy your child/children would play with for 10 years and hand down to their kids one day or an item you could have easily sold on online auction sites for at least half of what you initially spent. We all know it, 'if u want something good u pay a little more'.. so lets not be delusional about the cost of these being too much. In comparison to other toys... they are but a fraction of the cost, based on the possibilities....(see below)<br /><br />Possibilities:<br />These things are almost entirely unlimited in regards to what they will allow someone to produce. When my son first started playing with them he would make 'floors' for his trucks to drive over, then it was simple enclosure unites, then enclosure units with roofs, then villages with roads and buildings, then airports and firehouses, etc... hence the reason we need more blocks. I am having a hard time keeping up with his very creative mind.<br /><br />Why:<br />These blocks for 100 bucks, or whatever u spend on them, trumps any other 'setting' toy you can buy, such as a TTT setting to run trains on which gets old after a while, although the tracks allow for imagination. Even with train tracks though you can only run trains on them. These pieces allow for you to, as described above, build whatever. My son has built house for his 'stuffed animals'... heck... we even built some for his dinosaurs and for him on one occasion.<br /><br />Perks:<br />So easy to store and for the analytical/OCD type person who loves to clean up after their kids, these blocks are ideal. A few minutes and they are exactly as neat as they were when they first arrived in their original packaging. Not many toys can offer that... not to mention these avoid the infamous 'middle of the night' stepping on a (little block) and screaming murder.<br /><br />So.. I am here to simply praise Valtech for their exceptional product. These blocks are sturdy, safe and break proof (or so they appear to be). I am a very hands on father and I spend countless hours with my son playing games (he is an only child, that turns 3 this coming week). I've found great joy in playing with him with these blocks and watching his brain develop in a number of fashions.. below are some of the learning benefits I believe these blocks offer:<br />1. Patience in understanding how long it takes to build something up<br />2. Mechanical Dexterity<br />3. Resiliency in rebuilding things that fall<br />4. Geometry/Shapes recognition<br />5. Mathematics/Counting<br />6. Physis; Forces; Magnetism/Leverage<br />7. Teambuilding<br />8. Creative play<br />9. Pre-approach<br />10....(more I'm sure to come as my child grows)<br /><br />I DID NOT receive any sort of discount on this product. I do not receive any perks for writing this review other than knowing that I possibly helped lead you to buy these blocks for your child or children to play with. That in of itself would be rewarding enough or me and make me happy for having taken the time to review these blocks.<br /><br />We have since started branching out with these blocks:<br />-Plays with them in the shower<br />-Bringing them to grandmas house<br />-Bringing them into the sandpit (Mr. Crabbie)<br /><br />My son calls these things 'sticky blocks' and they are one of his favorite toys. We really have played with them for at least a half an hour to 3 hours for the last 6 months straight. I'd say, its a bit much, (the playing that is), however, I know with my son we are going to play..it is very rewarding to know I am doing my job as a parent and able to find some 'enjoyment' myself in watching his little brain expand before my eyes... These are the epitome of the type of item you buy to enrich your kids life. I took a while to buy a STEM toy/product in that I wanted to buy the right one... this one.. on the 4th purchase continues to reaffirm my belief that there is no better toy available out there.<br /><br />Cons: None<br />Additional information: Magnetic Strength is good<br />Suggestions: Buy Base that avoids using 4 'big squares', buy a carrying case, take pictures of each of your designs<br /><br />Questions? I'm happy to provide additional thoughts should you have any questions.<br /><br />Enjoy.. and remember... You cant say 100 bucks is allot of money for a toy, if you are eating out each night, drink, smoke, etc...","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+VG1PjBsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+VG1PjBsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+VG1PjBsL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bq9yIeKdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bq9yIeKdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Bq9yIeKdL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TyFqc3ydL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TyFqc3ydL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TyFqc3ydL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W3-h4anLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W3-h4anLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71W3-h4anLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AEWBBNPW5FLWVWL4VN6KHU7OOCFA,1462247931000,406,True

They are pretty darn durable (beware of knockoff) and the magnets are quite strong. My son also loves to mix building materials and has used wooden blocks to fortify structures so he could make them taller.

My son and daughter have been playing with Magna-Tiles NON-STOP for 4 years. FOUR SOLID YEARS and still going. Truth be told, my husband and I enjoy them, too. Who doesn't love building? Magna tiles are educational and fun. Playing with them enhances engineering, math, art, focus, creativity, persistence and require no batteries! My kids build with them, make patterns, count, challenge gravity...it's amazing. They are cool (because they're clear and are great colors). They are durable (sometimes clear things look foggy over time - not so with magna-tiles; they've never cracked, chipped, or had any defects). They're easily stored and always fun. Hands down the very best gift we've ever purchased for the kids. We'll update this review when we've all stopped playing with them. :)<br />UPDATE: AUGUST 2014 - Kids are getting older and toys are turning to electronic only. However....Magna-Tiles are still used consistently. They now build with bigger vision and creativity. The tiles still look as great as they did in the beginning. If you want to really do something outstanding, get or make your kids a light box so they can build on top. Awesome! Best toy investment ever. The bonus is how fun it is to still play with them...bring out your inner kid :)<br />Update April 2016 - Kids asked for more.....still going strong on durability and high usage.

569,4.0,"Better than Legos, fun way to build quickly","My two boys (6 and 2) love these.  The soft clicking as they snap together is such a soothing sound, and unlike Legos, these some apart with a good push.  Since I feel like our house is quickly becoming a Lego museum full of masterpieces that my kids never want to dismantle, I appreciate the fact that these are actually fun to knock down.<br />There are only four large squares.  As I watched my son open it and start to build a box, I was worried that he would be frustrated by the fact there were only four large squares and a cube needs six. But he immediately realized he could snap together four small squares to make a large square, then snap together two small triangles to make a small square!  Everything that people have written about the open ended play, spacial awareness and educational value is totally true.  It's a great lesson in shapes, but lead to my only issue with these.<br />But only complaint is about the long triangles, and I can tell this is going to drive all of us a little nuts.  When put together, they ALMOST make a circle.  Literally, it is a crack away from a huge gorgeous circle.  There are 360 degrees in a circle, so can't imagine why they wouldn't have made these exactly 30 degree angles to all fit together.  You can't even shove another piece into the gap, and the magnets aren't strong enough to allow us to pull them together into a bowl.  I'm going to put away half of these pieces so my kids stop trying to ""solve"" this challenge.<br />My other suggestion is to buy a light box as a building surface.  They are pricey, but if you are already paying over $100 for these, look into a light box for the amazing effect of glowing pieces.  The light box is also so attractive that it encourages them to keep the pieces there, instead of scattered all over the house.<br /><br />If you found this review useful, please ""like"" this review.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41U3jvR-WcL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41U3jvR-WcL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41U3jvR-WcL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pQyhS8GbL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pQyhS8GbL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pQyhS8GbL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AERFQ72MURN5YEK7VAXC7YVJCQUQ,1387987223000,104,False

The twins are now 9, and they have been happily playing together with them for about 2 hours today. Not a single one of them has ever broken, even through rough play and corralling Barbies, action figures, and live guinea pigs. (Yes, really!) They've even played ""Demolition"" and none have ever cracked.<br /><br />They are expensive (usually over $1 each), but I was just remarking to my children that those were the best dollars we ever spent on toys. Go ahead and invest in the big set - you'll never regret it. The only problem we've ever had was fighting when someone hoarded too many pieces, so go for the 100-pack. I wish we had a lot more than that, even, for those times when they all play together. (Yes, they're still fun even for our 13-year-old!)<br /><br />When the twins were little, they built 2-dimensional shapes on the table and loved how the big, bright shapes clicked together when the magnets connected. The older ones moved right into 3-D shapes and built diamonds, space ships, houses (and pools) for Barbie and action heroes, etc. They get put away for a while, and then they get them out and play for hours again.<br /><br />The shapes are all big enough to be safe for little ones (and easily found to put away), and the magnets are all contained completely inside the tough plastic shells, so we felt completely safe letting them all play. Unless your kids play with hammers, they shouldn't be able to break these and get the magnets out. (And yes, if it were possible my kids would have done it.)<br /><br />Today we were talking about the different kinds of triangles (equilateral, isosceles, etc.), and the twins were identifying the types in the set of Magnatiles.

My 3-year-old has been interested in these for over a year now and it never gets old. Unlike other toys which collect dust on the shelf after the first few uses, this is a toy that he keeps returning to day after day. Yes, they are quite pricey and I'm as frugal as they come, but they are so worth the investment. They are much more than a toy-- they are definitely intellectually-stimulating and educational. My little one thinks of new ways to use them everyday (one day he'll use them to build a tunnel for his trains, and the next day he'll build a castle for his figurines, another day he'll build a giant crocodile or a tall tower, etc). There are so many ways to play with these and use your creativity and imagination. As a parent, I love them and feel good about the fact that he's learning about math, geometry, and a whole lot more without even knowing that he is doing it. My husband and I often find some of his toys a little boring after a while, but this is a toy that we can genuinely have fun with ourselves. We love to watch our little architect-in-training building with his Magnatiles.

About a week ago, I put it away on a high shelf to give it a rest.  When the toddler couldn't sleep last night, I brought it back out for him and he greeted it with delight and played quietly for more than an hour, building some sophisticated structures on his own.  These connect so much easier than Legos or similar building toys, although arguably aren't so versatile for older children.  Cars travel down ramps and under bridges, and little people live and work in their houses and office buildings.  The fact that they cling so well to one another makes them a cinch to clean up, and the kids actually like collecting the pieces and stacking them into their (separately purchased) plastic container.

Well, six months later my kids are still playing with these, so a toy with staying power is a rare find and something I like (especially given the price of these things).  The kids get creative making houses, hotels, parking lots, tunnels etc.  The two year old mostly builds flat 2D things, the 5 year old is a little more creative with 3D objects.  One thing we don't like is how easily the magna tiles collapse if you build a multi-story building.

My boys are now 14, 13 and 10 and the magna tiles are the only toys still being played with in the toy room on a consistent basis.  Not one tile has ever broken and again, we are talking about 10 years worth of daily use!  What other toy is played with daily for 10 years and still looks as good as new.  As I mentioned before, I am also an elementary principal.  I now have 20 classes of kindergarten and first grade students and this is still the favorite indoor recess toy.  I buy a few new sets a year because every teacher wants a couple of sets for recess.  Again, not one broken tile  and many of our sets are ten years old.  Don't think they are too expensive.  Instead think about all the toys you spent $30 - $40 on that were played with for a few weeks or months and then tossed aside.  That won't happen with these.  These will be played with often and then passed down to your grandkids.<br /><br />My review from 10 years ago - Yes, Magna tiles are pricey but well worth it.  We have three boys ages  5, 4, and 1.  They all love playing with the magna tiles and build some pretty amazing structures.  We purchased one set of 100 for Christmas and then realized we really needed another set.  With two sets, there are plenty to go around and everyone has fun building.  I would recommend the clear ones.  Kids like to build houses and barns they can put their animals and cars into and still see them.  I am also an elementary principal and we bought several sets for indoor recess and for our latchkey program and they are used on a daily basis and have been for about 6 months.  They are holding up great and again, the kids love them.  I see kids from age 5 - 11 playing with them at school.

Though these tiles are expensive, the fun and endless variety of things that can be built makes them well worth the price.  They are colorful and seem to be very durable.

785,4.0,Great for creative play.. beware you will more than likely need more...,"I'm not a plastic fan. I really try to limit plastic in our house and, in doing so, waited a very long time to get these. A family member wanted to give to our LO as a gift, so I ordered as I knew she liked them from using them at school. We had once told friends that we were going to leave them for a school-only toy and we were told that of all the toys we could focus on that we should add these to our collection. They said the only thing we'd regret was not getting them sooner. Well, they were right. LO was so thrilled to get these and they have been used daily. I have even purchased two expansion packs so she can build bigger things. They really are great toys for creativity, understanding angles and how things works together, etc. And they are so useful when you need to cook or clean or do something that LO doesn't want to or can't be involved. Just point your child in this direction and s/he will be happy. Honestly, they are taken out without any prodding and so many things have been built. It is amazing to watch the brain just hum while using these. A reluctant (do to the high plastic footprint) huge fan.<br /><br />We invested in these versus other magnetic sets that might be cheaper because a school teacher shared that some of the more economical sets don't build as well as the magnets don't hold as strongly and pieces fall more easily; and that the magnets are at increased risk of falling out. We have pets in the house and don't want anyone swallowing small magnets. We also don't want to provide a toy that creates frustration because it can't hold.<br /><br />The only thing I will say is this is an expensive toy/habit, as the price point is high for what they can build with the sets. Even with this 100-piece set our LO was looking for more with her very first build. Also, the set doesn't include enough of the large pieces. To stabilize some builds, depending on what your intended child does with these, those will be needed. And I think many will find this need. They sell them in expansion packs of 8 pieces each and we've already bought two of those - $50 for 16 pieces! Do the math with this set at 100 pieces and something seems a bit off. With each new set of these we buy I can see that we'll also need to invest in those too, which is a rather hefty price tag all at once. Would be nice to see them available at a better price or in bundle packages with a cost reduction for the higher count purchase built in, as they are really pricey for only 8 pieces.<br /><br />All in all, this is such a great toy for kids (just please never throw away... so many people want these that they can be reused by friends and family or schools or daycare centers, as well as many others. they are plastic so my only worry is not having these end up in a landfill).",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AEVBRQGEEWWMWCGY336ATXB3JOLQ,1519759329074,5,True

I recommend that people sit tight until they are available for purchase and are more reasonably priced. The company stated back in October that they were able to retrieve the templates from the flooded factory and that they would build another factory on higher ground.

863,5.0,Possibly the world's most perfect toy,"I've worked with kids for 11 years and ever since Magna-Tiles have come on the scene I have yet to find a better toy. They are almost indestructible (I have yet to see one destroyed, even in an elementary classroom, but I'm sure it's possible if your child has a sledge hammer). They invite creativity, shape sorting, color identification, building, teamwork, etc. Mostly they are a BLAST. I hate most kid toys but I'll happily help build things with Magna-Tiles for hours. Kids of all ages (from babies to... everyone) will have fun with them. They are safe (no choking hazards here!) and easy to use. I've noticed toddlers become very frustrated with duplo blocks because they can't manipulate them easily, or with blocks because they towers tumble too quickly. These tiles stick together very easily and come apart with just a little effort - so towers are easy to build and sturdy unless you choose to knock them down.<br /><br />I've seen kids make stables, houses, towers, desks, caves, tracks for the Thomas trains, etc. They are perfect for every family.

875,3.0,Not all they're hyped up to be,"We purchased a 100 piece set to give to our four kids for Christmas (2-9 years old), and we were super excited for our kids to open it.  Unfortunately, the excitement ended when the box was opened.  The three main things that we were disappointed with were:<br /><br />1) The tiles look and feel very cheap.  At $1+ per piece they should look fairly good.  We were expecting something solidly constructed and sturdy looking, but instead found that they are simply two pieces of plastic (one for the front and back) held together by a few rivets. (a.k.a. hollow plastic tiles)<br />2) The magnets are very weak.  Instead of having magnets lining the entire edges of the tiles, there are just a few small magnets on each side. The small magnets that are used are so weak that they can barely even hold a single tile off the ground when connected together.  When you put the tiles together (on the floor) they do not hold tight and stay aligned on their edges, they simply are attracted to each other and will stay together as long as there is nothing leaning on them or putting any force at all on them.  If you place a tile vertically on top of another tile, the magnets aren't even strong enough to keep the one tile vertical... it just falls over unless you have other tiles balancing it in place.<br />3) The tiles are much larger than we had anticipated.  This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if the magnets were stronger, but with the magnets being as weak as they are, the tiles are just too large for them to keep connected very well.<br /><br />With that all being said, my kids did enjoy the toy a little bit today (they opened this gift today).  They created a few small blocks, buildings, etc., but it didn't keep their attention for very long because of the weakness of the magnets.  My kids are used to magnets with a strength more along the lines Magnetix (they *love* these), and with these tiles falling apart so easily they were somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />My opinion on these may change as the toy is played with some more, but on first glance and after a day of my kids playing with them, I wouldn't recommend these to others.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AH6QAIH3COMK5RAXACEJSKIXNOWA,1356592067000,32,False

My boys use them to create all kinds of structures and then they play with their other toys in combination with the tiles.  I'm glad that I purchased the 100 piece set because between the three boys there are never enough to go around.  We are seriously considering purchasing another set so that all three boys can build their own structures at the same time.

I have not been disappointed - this toy is simply awesome while being so very basic.<br /><br />I was a little worried that my boys may be 'too old' for it since most of the reviews are written for younger kids but I was pleasantly surprised when they both loved it and I find that the 8 year old plays with it far more since he is able to build larger creations without it breaking.  Yesterday he built a house for all his action figures!  I even love to sit and play with it.  The pieces 'stick' together so easily yet the magnet is pretty strong so that the pieces don't come apart easily.<br /><br />The 100 set is a good amount of blocks.  I am not sure I would invest the $$ into a smaller set unless it was just for one child, maybe 2-3 years old.  Anyone older will want to be able to make something bigger than what the smaller sets will allow.  I can actually see myself getting another 100 set in the near future because the few times my boys have built together they have fought over having enough pieces.<br /><br />Overall, great purchase and well worth the money.

934,4.0,AWESOME for long-lasting DAILY creative play for 3-8 year olds...even if they are a little pricey - you get your money's worth.,"We LOVE our Magna-Tiles.  We first discovered them on a visit to the local museum, who also had a light table underneath them to provide better instruction on color combination as well as building.  The ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars is because of the price-point and limited number of shapes.  Yes, they are expensive, but, unlike other toys I spent a little less on and my kids eventually tossed to the side, THESE have PROVIDED HOURS of fun for our 3, 5 and & 7 yo's who all play TOGETHER with them - for OVER A YEAR.  We are in the midst of moving and in a shorter-term housing while most of our stuff is in storage.  The ONE toy we couldn't live without was our Magna Tiles.  However, with the reduction in toy options and all 3 playing at once daily, we needed MORE pieces.  I was hesitant to pay another $120+ for 100 more pieces.  We landed on supplementing this set with the Magnetic Stick N Stack 120-piece Classic Plus, which we combined with this one for more variety of shapes - and at a little less money on a per-piece basis.  They work together perfectly.  The Magna-Tiles do seem stronger in terms of magnetic strength as well as the plastic components.  If price and shape variation aren't an issue for you - I'd buy 3 boxes of these...but we wanted variety, and we wanted economy.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AGFUEHA37DRWDIPZFD57EXSLUIHQ,1454956262000,1,True

948,5.0,The best toy we have so far,"I told my parents that our daughter really liked to play with these at the Discovery Center, so she got it for Christmas from ""Santa"" (she was then 19mo). It has been over 6 months since then and she is still playing with these tiles nearly every day! Our Magna-Tiles were ""tested"" on other kids of different ages (1 to 5 yo) everybody liked playing with them.<br /><br />None of the tiles broke so far - absolutely no problems in this area.<br /><br />I first thought not to rate the educational value, but then I thought that it helped her learn better what the triangle and square look like, she now feels well what sorts of tiles she needs to take to build various kinds of houses she is building, she knows how to put the triangles upside down when she is building the roof of a wider building, she knows what kind of triangles (and how) she needs to put together if there is not enough squares to build what she wants... I think she already knew the colors when we got the Magna-Tiles, but the colors (there are 5) are great and they are also being used - to build ""all green"" room in the house, for example.<br /><br />Using one's imagination these tiles can be used not only for building houses and castles - the colorful floor looked great; yesterday she put longer triangles in the bucket and said that those are slices of watermelon - the shape is similar to the real ones I cut myself :) ; at one point today I saw that the tiles were used as ""chairs"" in a ""restaurant"" :)<br /><br />I was right when I told my parents that the Tiles have to be of clear color - it is important that she can see the characters in the houses she builds through the walls - see for herself and show the others without having to open anything. Sometimes she also makes a 2x2 square out of 4 squares and looks through it to notice ""the world becoming a different color"".<br /><br />Even though there is a 100 pieces, I still consider them as easy to clean up, because they stick to each other and it is very easy to build up a pile and put it back in the box.<br /><br />We never had any big squares at home, so we did not miss them :).<br /><br />Great toy!<br />--------<br />Update: it now has been 18 months since we got the first set - she still plays with it almost every day and we got a second 100-set for her 3rd Birthday.

I didn't know what they were then, but I bumped into them again on Amazon while looking for some educational toys.  I read some of the reviews and decided to take a chance on them.  I am not sorry that I got the 100 piece set.  Like the review before stated, the 100 piece set now comes with 4 large 6X6 tiles.<br /><br />My daughter immediately remembered playing with the tiles when she was being tested and she also recalled playing with them in a toy store she visited with her dad.<br /><br />She already started building castles and garages for her play minivan.  We were building (yes, I play with them too!) and discussing the different shapes.  We talked about equalateral triangles having 3 equal sides and put them next to isosceles triangles to take note of the differences.<br /><br />I think these are better than Legos and allows for open ended play.  My daughter decided that for one of her inventions, she would just keep joining the pieces side by side instead of building up, so she had a great big flat design.  I never thought about building something flat but she did.<br /><br />If you can afford it, get the 100 piece set so that two people can build at the same time.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AHNARWIGTLM2EZDFA2TF4UIF7XRQ,1262018075000,1,True

I was concerned that the boys wouldn't understand how to stack them up, but I was totally wrong.<br />I got home from work last night and my nanny and three kids were building a huge tower with the magna tiles.

The biggest difference I notice is the weight of each tile. Magna-Tiles are heavier, sturdier and have a stronger magnet but my kids love them all just the same. I've had pieces of the Stick and Stack crack though because they're not as solid and at that point you have to throw them away for safety so If you're thinking about the Magna-Tiles vs the Picasso's vs the Stick and Stacks etc., I would say make the Magna-Tiles your base product and then add variety with the cheaper brands since Magna-Tiles doesn't have a lot of the interesting pieces you'll find with other brands.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AGDX33U3IDPXGELJ56WK6AKNZI7A,1432429618000,4,True

1318,5.0,5 year and 2 year review,"Perspective in 2019:<br /><br />usage background: we are parents to 3 children (7, 3 year olds and a 9 month old crawler) we also host a monthly parenting support group with tons of random kids running ard.<br /><br />our first set of magnatiles 5 years ago (100 pieces) we bought a second set 2 years back. The long and short of it is we are considering getting a 3rd set with our crawler joining in the chaos of building and destruction.<br /><br />These tiles are costlier in Asia and we were really concerned we wld be duped into paying for a brand. We have spent days trawling through reviews and blogs and this repeats each time we plan to purchase a new set.<br /><br />Primary reason we are repeated and convinced supporters of magnatiles<br /><br />1. Safety. I have 3 kids so even if I am watching them, my brain zones off periodically. We rather have a smaller set of safe toy, than a larger set of tiles that has a occasional crack and loose magnet, which in my humble experience WILL Happen on that very day I am not present. This may not be an issue for older kids but we wanted something that was reliable even if it takes us (and the kids) months to save up for a set.<br /><br />We have built towers off tables that collapsed. Simulated crashes. Tiles thrown in anger. Stomped on by Tiny humans morphed into anger green men. I am glad to report Everyone and every tile survived With only Some scratches.<br /><br />In perspective: our 2 large square base plates from stick and stack had cracked within a year from nil obvious trauma.<br /><br />A summary of blogs and reviews also listed issues with durability for other common brand such as Picasso tiles (cracked tiles) playmags (magnets loosening) and stick and stack. (this is not a paid review and I can't lie as I am a mom with 3 kids watching me. every single moment).<br /><br />So In summary after so many years, we have decided again we would pay for the branding in this case, or rather For the quality control. The only other magnetic toys we have found to be of comparable manufacturing standards are magformers and tegu.<br /><br />2. The magnet strength (I am not a scientist) has not been a problem for us. Normal collapses due to mechanical miscalculation serves in our opinion to challenge their concepts of balance and support so it has never been an issue for us. The boys have learnt so much and watched videos on how to improve their design.<br /><br />We are also able to stick them on fridges and create patterns and shape. I'm not sure how strong these magnets should be but I'm just saying they work well enough for us.<br /><br />3. Price these do not go on sale. Especially in Asia. So if you are waiting and live in Asia. Don't hold Yr breath. 😅 We have tried and are tired. Our 7 and 3 year old have taken 6 months to save 48 bucks and they might just make it in time for Christmas!",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AF4NPFJMGE3S7HQF6LN75KH7WBEQ,1554823660846,1,False

They are now 5, 4 and 3, and never seem to tire of these at all. They build great houses and garages for the Paw Patrol pup figures and vehicles, and even for stuffed animals, have done mazes on the base plates (more about them in a second), and the little guy even likes to write out his letters on the floor using squares and triangles.  I started with the 100-piece Magnatile set after reading a bunch of reviews.  These are the pricier choice, but I believe the quality is worth it.  It's been over a year and we haven't had a single problem with any tiles.  I also got a set of two 12x12"" baseplates from ShapeMags, because Magnatiles does not offer baseplates, and find that their quality is also excellent.  We find the baseplates invaluable to aid stability when building large and tall constructions.  They also make it easier to move the constructions, if necessary, once built. Since that initial set, I have added another large set, two sets of the Magnatiles Rectangles, the ""House"" set, and the set of two car bases.  All were great. Kudos to Magnatiles for making tiles in almost all the rainbow colors (there's only one blue, so no ""blue and indigo"" is possible). The kids are obsessed with rainbows and enjoy using the color tiles in purposeful patterns. Really pretty! I totally recommend these as a wonderfully creative toy that the kids will play with for years.  Adults like them, too! I can see another 100-piece set in our near future!

My boys are now 7 1/2, and they are still among the most played with toys in our home.  There is never a week that goes by that they aren't building something.  Recently I used them to explain ""squaring"" numbers and square roots.  Their second grade friends enjoy them when they come over, and even some early teen cousins found them fun to experiment with.

1618,5.0,Perfect for children with limited fine motor skills.,"My grandson will be turning 5 in 3 months. He has a severe seizure disorder and is on a serious amount of medicine so his fine motor skills are affected and his hands shake badly. He cannot use regular building toys, like duplos because his hands shake too badly to be able to line up the holes and nubs and tinker toys because of the need to put a stick in hole or Lincoln logs, you get the jist. These came yesterday and he and I and his twin sisters (2 1/2) built with them for an hour. He easily made very complicated and beautiful structures and was so proud of them. These magnetic tiles are the perfect building medium for a child with poor fine motor skills to have success and pride at something he couldn't do before. I loved to build with them too. The geometric shapes are nice because the grandkids have to figure out what shapes can fit together and where to place them. With the other building sets I have, don't have to use as much reasoning and spatial skills. Even the 2 year old twins were noticing if there was an area could put a certain sized triangle in they would pick the correct one of the 3 and turn it around until it lined up and then add it to their creations. No help from me. I am so pleased with this set and, even though so expensive, am here to order a smaller set already.

We've showed her how to make new shapes, and she picks it up immediately and starts using the new shapes into her own designs. I'd guess she plays with them at least 2 hours per day, more than any other toys she owns.<br /><br />I definitely recommend them. They also keep her occupied when I'm too busy to be her entertainment, and it's much better for her to use her brain than to park herself on the couch in front of the TV.<br /><br />They may seem pricey, but well worth it.

I suggest using your set on a carpeted floor, or just taking down your creations really carefully. This is a great set, although if you’re planning to store it in the packaging, it might not work very well.

1706,5.0,Definitely go for the big set,"My daughter played with these in a preschool we visited.  She talked about playing with the ""magnet blocks"" for a while.  It wasn't until I went back to enroll her did I realize what she was talking about.  She sat right down and played with them again and when it was time to go, she didn't want to leave.  In looking for a present for her 4th birthday, I remembered these blocks and found them on Amazon.  It came down to these blocks or the Leapster (and that was really a bribe so that I could play with our iphone). This was an easy choice and I am pleased with it.  She saw me browsing the listing on Amazon and immediately said ""Oh, can I build that?"".  I don't know if I'll be able to wait until the 11th to give it to her! I was very tempted to buy the 32 piece set.  I know shipping is free for this item, but my delivery estimate ended on the 14th, so I went ahead and paid for the shipping.  At $126 this was a pretty big toy investment for me, so I read each and every comment.  I decided to heed the advice of parents who said to spring for the 100.  Looking at this box (and I'll confess, I did play with it them briefly)- we're going to need more. In the end, I decided to buy these because we spring for educational toys.  We've never purchased a Fisher Price or Playskool toy that we've felt was a good use of our money, or that we didn't want to toss. My children loose interest in them too soon and they take up too much space. I wanted to get a building toy to develop spatial awareness and creativity, but didn't want to be stepping on legos the next decade.  This is a fantastic alternative to that, and I think my kids will like them better.  Yes, these are expensive, however, I anticipate that these will be well used, by all three of my children for a long time, which makes them a better value than cheaper toys that are forgettable.  Save yourself the grief and buy the bigger set, if only that it's more bang for your buck.  I hope this set lasts us until our next birthday- 8 months from now.  I'll be getting my younger daughter a set then.<br /><br />The only complaint I can think of is this: My daughter is a very visual learner.  I would have liked to have some type of instruction book (other than the illustrations on the back of the box) for her to use as a reference.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AGHCV37UP5KTGMXNFEFLRLN5M7HQ,1272647683000,4,True

I hesitated to buy them because my son's preschool classroom had them and I thought if we had them at home too he might get bored with them.  I got them on sale at a local independent toy store but I can tell you this is the best investment I've made in ANY toy.  He's built so many different things with magna tiles: a barn, the Titanic, Superman's Fortress of Solitude, the Sears Tower, the Batcave, Batmobile, many different forms of planes and space ships, and many more that I can't recall.  I have a whole digital album dedicated to his structures.  My daughter, at age two, also really enjoys playing with them, at this stage mostly sorting colors and exploring how the magnets attract and repel each other, building small structures, and knocking down her brother's large structures :)  They've held up really well to the use and abuse, but we do have a few pieces that are starting to crack at the edge.  Moms and Dads can have a lot of fun with them too--I highly recommend!",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AG665NHGKVJPJ4Z7FMA35LH5KLXA,1351008304000,1,False

1799,5.0,Brilliant building toy for two-year olds and adults alike!,"From his second birthday, these quickly became one of my nephew's favorite toys. I bought these for his birthday and both he and his parents *really* enjoy playing with them (as do I). The colors are beautiful and they're extremely well constructed. The magnets are completely protected so there's no concern that they might be removed and swallowed.<br /><br />Two is still a little too young for him to enjoy playing with them completely alone, but he participates actively and move tiles around as he wants. Mom & Dad usually build the main structure and he makes changes and requests.<br /><br />He especially likes to use them to make parking garages, roads, hangars & airports for his cars & planes. He is able to add and remove tiles to seal them inside and loves having little things hidden throughout his structures that he can get to himself. Even on his second birthday it only took him a few seconds to realize he could add or remove tiles to do this: they're completely intuitive.<br /><br />The magnets are cleverly designed so they can spin, so there's no trouble with polarity. The magnets are strong enough that it's pretty easy to build skinny towers that are several feet tall. These are lots of fun for a little boy to destroy!<br /><br />He loves to crash into them with his die-cast cars and planes, and they've held up quite well despite countless crashes. The first set of tiles have gotten a bit scratched up so they're not quite as pretty, but they're still smooth and perfectly functional. They hold up well even when stepped on by an adult with shoes on hardwood.<br /><br />He started with a 100-piece set and we just added this 74-piece set, which is opening up even more options for cool constructions. I think there might be even more coming in his future, as I think he'll play with these for years. Unlike Legos, the ability to snap new tiles on in any direction makes it easier to just keep building up and out without a master plan, so you can never have too many tiles!<br /><br />Don't overlook the possibility of using these to make flat structures like roads and tangram-like patterns. It's fun to make buildings, castles and towers, but there are lots of possibilities for flat creations as well.<br /><br />There are other brands out there that are a bit cheaper and that have some more specialized tiles like windows & cars. They aren't constructed as well and the magnets are not as strong. My suggestion is to start with Magna-Tiles and maybe add some other sets once you have a good base set of tiles and the kids are a bit older. Having a few window or arch pieces would be fun, but there are countless possibilities with just the main base pieces without a need for more specialized tiles.<br /><br />The only real frustration my nephew's had with them is that it's very tempting to want to build little rocket ships out of them and fly them around, but they fall apart fairly easily when he flies them around, which sometimes can leave him a bit frustrated. I don't think this is a design flaw, as if the magnets were much stronger I think he'd have a hard time pulling them off in other situations.<br /><br />Overall I can't recommend these more strongly. They're lots of fun for a two-year-old child and his or her adult friends. I suspect my nephew will be happily making buildings on his own by 3½.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AF6RHCRGJKN5BADAAARYWRK62I2Q,1451792336000,1,False

1824,5.0,An all time favorite,"This has got to be one of the best toys for toddler and young children.  We love it.  The magnets are not so strong that it takes a lot of effort to pull apart.  Some reviewers complain that they are not strong enough to hold the pieces together for long, and I will disagree.  Yes, they do get knocked over, or if you are not balancing properly, they will fall over, but that's the beauty of the game.  This is not meant to be some rare earth magnet game that will hold all pieces regardless of how you put them together.  It teaches focus, balancing, and some precision.<br /><br />My children and their classmates all began playing with the MagnaTiles when they were 2 years old.  And you can watch them progress in complexity.  They start with 2-D objects, connecting them flat on a surface, then eventually they venture into 3-D objects.  It exercises their eyes-hands coordination and other skills.  My children would play for 40 min stretches which is a long time for 2 year olds, and can spend a while raining afternoon playing with these.  We own both the 100-pc set and the 48-pc DX set for added interest and because believe it or not, 148 pieces is barely enough for two kids.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AGXHMJTYYWHN5NIH5MPDRMGXMDYA,1412196965000,2,True

1831,5.0,One of the best toys ever,"As the mom of 2 boys, ages 6 and 8, I've seen a lot of toys come and go from our house.  These are definitely one of the best.<br /><br />My youngest son was introduced to magna tiles at daycare when he was 3. He was always playing with them every single day when I went in to pick him up. At 4, he asked Santa for his own set of magna tiles,  and knowing how much he loved them Santa got him the 100 piece set. He and his brother played with them almost every single day that year.  Their only complaint was that they didn't have enough tiles to build what they wanted.  At 5, my son asked for another set for Christmas and Santa came through with another set of 100. Now at 6, almost 7, my son is asking for even more magna tiles, and I'm back for a third set of 100. He still plays with these all the time, and his 8 year old brother plays with him.<br /><br />They love these so much,  and it is amazing what they build with them.  Their creativity knows no bounds with these,  and they never get tired of them. On top of that, these things are tough. Even our original set is still going strong.  We haven't had a single magna tile show any damage other than minor scratches.<br /><br />I know they're expensive, but when you factor in how much they get played with they're actually a bargain.  I've bought so many toys that were a total waste of money because they never really got played with, or broke too soon. Not these.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anybody. My only regret is not buying some sooner.  Be aware though that you do need alot of these to really build anything. I would say the 100 piece set is really the minimum except for maybe really young children.<br /><br />I also highly recommend getting a couple of the large 1-foot square tiles that are availble from another brand. They work great with the magna tiles and really make building large structures easier.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AGOVSLJHWWTRQ372OHTXUETTFF3A,1510078246882,50,True

1859,5.0,Has been used for years - One of the few that survive the test of time,"Magna-Tiles first came to my attention when my oldest son was in Kindergarten (2013).  The YMCA after school program had a LARGE (500 piece) set they kept onsite at his school for the kids to play with.<br /><br />Each day that we picked him up, boys and girls alike were playing with these things. These kids would be completely focused on a project: building a city together, making roads and garages for matchbox cars, creating beds for dolls - whatever they could think of.  These things were 'anything they wanted them to be'.  They were always pulled out and being played with, each day.  They were either the main item they were playing with (such as towers, buildings, etc.), or they were accompanying the other toys they had out (streets for the Lincoln Log town, landing platforms for their LEGO ships, homes for the Barbies, etc.).<br /><br />When our youngest daughter turned 2, I decided to bite the bullet on the price and purchase this 100 piece set for her Birthday.  Sure, was young - but I knew these would be a long-living toy staple for both our kids. I also liked that we could add onto their set as time went on.<br /><br />Boy, was I right.  Our daughter (now 4), and our son (now 9) still play with these things almost everyday.<br /><br />I have seen these things be everything - buildings, roads, stuck together and then 'cut' into pieces of food for the kitchen set, designs, 3D ships, a great wall of China around our poor sleeping dog, fortress walls, Nerf gun targets, doll houses, and the ever classic - 'how high can we make a tower before it breaks?!'.<br /><br />Out of all the toys that they have, my husband and I joke that we know what items we'll hang onto for our future grand children...  Magna-Tiles are one of the few.  Seriously, they are timeless.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AEX6PC6LYNY45SJHOXBDFI4UPY3A,1488569887000,7,True

Seriously, don’t even look away or get up to go to the bathroom. Be responsible, please.<br /><br />Durability / Longevity Rating: 5/5<br />My set has withstood moderate mistreatment from a toddler over the course of 4 months and still looks new. No pieces have broken. They have been frequently stepped on, chucked across the room, and dropped onto a tile floor.<br /><br />Appearance /Presentation Rating: 5/5<br />Colorful and attractive. Not an eyesore.<br /><br />Construction / Usefulness / Practicality Rating: 4/5<br />They are lightweight; I’d say no potential for broken windows, busted sheetrock, broken tile; not likely to result in severe injury and or concussion if they happen to become projectiles. The magnets rattle around when you shake an individual piece (not a negative quality).<br /><br />Useful as an educational tool. Examples: construction; spatial concepts; geometry; multiple mathematical concepts; matching; stacking; etc.<br /><br />The magnets are acceptable. Refer to my attached video; I have taken one Magformer and one Magna-Tile, each of similar size, placed them onto a magnetic baking tray, and demonstrated their staying power by tapping the tray against the floor.  You can see that the Magformer generally stays put, while the Magna-Tile easily slides off.<br /><br />I have found that, while it is possible to build tall/complex 3-D structures from these tiles, they generally work best as 2-D teaching aids (for me, anyhow). The magnets are not incredibly strong, but they do the job. 3D structures are easily collapsible. This shouldn’t dissuade you from trying these out; they are still a useful educational tool, but the easy collapsibility might be frustrating for younger users or those without steady hands.<br /><br />Cost-Efficiency Rating (MSRP): 2/5<br />At the suggested retail price, this isn’t a cost-efficient item, and I haven’t seen this item go on sale yet.<br /><br />Likeliness of Repurchase: Not likely, unless discounted.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 4/5","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ACd7dIAUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ACd7dIAUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ACd7dIAUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AC3U2DwWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AC3U2DwWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81AC3U2DwWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AHGABQUCHGF7R6GXPAXLXUQBVONQ,1524516403973,10,True

She is a “master builder” at this point and has several sets so her creations know few bounds.  She and I often expand play when I am the shopkeeper with the Magna-Tile inventory and she makes purchases for whatever construction she has underway.  The tiles practically put themselves away because they attract to one another so easily.  When I help with cleanup,  I actually find it quite fun - quickly stacking them and putting them on her shelf with her.  You cannot go wrong with these. Do NOT get the KNOCK-Off’s. Only get REAL magna tiles. I am a retired teacher and would not let my babies play with anything but these.The others are not made as sturdy (I.e.safe) as magna tiles. Can’t say enough about the play value of these tiles.

2031,5.0,This Toy is a Keeper!,"I bought a 48 pc. set for my 3 year old five years ago.  Since then we have purchased two more sets.  My 8 year old still plays with them.  At first, my children weren't sure how to use them, but I sat down to show them some basics and within five minutes they were busy building.  The longer they have had them, the more things they learn to make with them.  My 8 year old girl enjoys making shapes and all sorts of different objects.  My 6 year old neice loves to build ""houses"" for her animals.  My 5 year old son makes ramps, roadways and garages for his cars.  All three of them do all sorts of other things with them; those are just some of their favorites  --to give you an idea of the varied possibilities. Our 10 year old neighbor loves to play with them as well.  This toy spans a large age group.<br />Magnatiles are very safe.  I also have a smaller child, and I am not worried if any of the pieces get left out;  they are too big to swallow and there are no sharp or unsafe pieces.  Children love to build things and Magnatiles are an easy beginning for even the youngest builder.  The magnets are strong enough to cling together well even if you get ""close enough"".  I have had my tiles for five years, and I have never had one to break.  They seem to be a sturdy, reliable, fun, educational toy.<br />I plan to keep mine even after my children out grow them.  They are a great toy to have around for children of our guests.  Since you can't just run down to Wal-Mart to buy this toy no one else I know has them, so when visitors come over they enjoy playing with this ""new"" toy.  I recommend the clear ones; the children like to see the animals and cars that they have put inside.  I also recommend the biggest set (110 pcs) because it is the best value, plus your children will be able to build bigger and better with more pieces.  We started with a 48 pc. set and it was big enough for our young ones to build and play with.

We waited a couple of months for the older son's birthday to arrive before we purchased them, as the 100-piece set (which is really the minimum you need, especially for more than one ""player"") is around $130 by the time you pay postage.  Due to the price, this was his only gift from us, but we thought that one gift was okay this year, as this toy sparks creativity and will begin to build math skills.  Everyone in the family is enjoying these.  Even my almost-three-year-old will spend 10-15 minutes at a time playing with them.  The pieces seem very sturdy (the magnets are encased in plastic, so I am comfortable that there's not a risk of ingestion), but my boys throw them at times, so I will need to watch for cracking.<br /><br />It would have been handy if they had come in a carrying case rather than just a cardboard box, but I bought a 15.5 liter Snapware container with lid and handle that holds them nicely, with room for growth in case we want to add to the collection someday.<br /><br />I agree with previous reviewers that the translucent tiles are preferable to the opaque ones because they can be used with a light table (as at the museum), and the user can place little people or objects inside and still be able to see them.<br /><br />I'm sure these will bring us years of enjoyment at different ages and stages.

It is by far the most-played present they received this year and is well-worth the price. They seem quite durable.  My 19-month old has been stepping on them (yikes!) but they haven't cracked.  She seems to just do 2D shapes for now unlike her 5-year old sister who has been making 3D objects.  Nice toy to introduce geometry.<br /><br />Even at a 100 pieces it seems like they can use more, if they have to share. For the most part it has worked out very well. This clear version is certainly very nice. You can put little objects inside when building boxes, houses, etc.<br /><br />It also stacks away neatly since they all just stick to each other in one big pile.  I don't have to worry about a 100 pieces scattering all over the place when it's time to clean up.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AEDWAGC45T6DUJOLB5TAPM3E3VNQ,1261946812000,0,True

2192,5.0,Encourages creativity,"I have a tale to tell.<br /><br />Several years ago, it seemed any package or letter that the carrier couldn't find was just delivered to us. Usually I managed to get it to the right place. There are two notable exceptions. One, a W-2 with my husband's (very common) name addressed to an address that didnt exist for a company not in our state, much less that he'd worked for. I tried on that. I googled variations of the address, contacted peeple with the name on Facebook. Google was odd. No matter what variation of the address I googled, I always found a guy in a blue GMC with wooden slats in place of the tailgate wearing a white hat. But I never did get that W-2 to the right person, even after calling the business and letting them know.<br /><br />Second was around Christmas, once of many packages left on our door but not for us and the only one I couldn't locate the right person. Name didn't exist on Google or social media and address didn't exist at all. FedEx said they'd come get it to properly deliver it, but never did. After several weeks, I opened it. Thus finding my son's favorite new toy.<br /><br />It was with these tiles that I realized my autistic son is a math genius. I got him more and he still loves them, five years later as he's about to turn 7. He loves to build and can tell you how many tiles he needs for his design before he's started. I just love how creative he gets. Honestly, this accidental gift from Fed-ex is the first thing that ever truly engaged him.",[],B000CBSNRY,B000CBSNRY,AFYXLALIS4G462QJIWJKGDIHF7QA,1578260617852,0,False

2194,5.0,Perfect for Building with Toddlers!,"Without hesitation I can easily rate Magna-Tiles a perfect five stars!  My three year old son and I were first introduced to them through his daycare provider.  I began to realize they were his toy of choice as I read his take home slips and saw his excitement in showing them to me at pickup each day.  They were all he seemed to talk about!<br /><br />Santa Claus brought this set to our home for Christmas this year.  It was non-stop play for days!  The magnetic sides make construction easier for young builders as the tiles &#34;snap&#34; into place.  Building requires a little less perfection than Legos or other traditional building blocks.  I enjoy building with my son and seeing his enthusiasm for making new things and taking them apart.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the 100 piece set versus the others with fewer tiles.  We use the majority of tiles each time we build.  I'd worry a smaller set would be too limiting.  We really like the see-through material of this set versus the opaque option.  Both build the same of course.<br /><br />My son is nearly four, and I can honestly say this is the best toy I've purchased for him out of everything we've ever gotten!  The cost is clearly high compared to a normal toy purchase you might make, but it is more than worth it!  We love Magna Tiles so much, my mom even picked up a set for her house for all the grandkids and visitors.

2250,4.0,9 Year review,"First bought these back in 2013. These magna tiles have gone through 3 kids with the third being 1 and half yrs old now. I've noticed that at that age they just like to destroy whatever you make, but that's okay. As they get older in the 2s and 3s they start building simple stuff and you can wow them with complicated combinations. The magnets aren't super strong, but they are strong enough where it will hold together without snapping together and pinching anyone's fingers. For me the funnest part of using these is finding ways to incorporate them into other toys. Like making a garage for hot wheels, creating tunnels and cities for your duplo train to pass through, or creating space ships for your lego Buz Lightyear to cruise around in. I happened to make a light table out of a cheap ikea table as well and it's cool to just set these on it and build and watch your structure illuminate.<br /><br />After 9 years I can only recall maybe two pieces cracking or breaking and that was only after my oldest at the time (maybe 7 or 8) had a friend over who was rough with the magna tiles. Outside of those two the only issue I've had with these is they get scuffed up over time and you lose one or two every now and then.

When I first got them I thought that they were too expensive for what you get, but I tried them out and he had so much fun with them. We have bought him five sets and he has 500 magnetic tiles. You need at least 300 to be able to make really cool things. I also like that these tiles are educational in a fun way. You learn to make buildings and how to support the roof. The tallest building he has made yet out of magnetic tiles was 7.6 feet! He had to get the kitchen stool and I never thought he would make something that big. These are great Christmas and birthday presents. And kids and adults of all ages can use them. They are great for using when you have a friend over to construct with both ideas. I like the see-though kind better than the non see-through kind because it looks like stained glass.

Because the tiles contain small magnets I was concerned about child safety. I liked the fact that all magnets are sealed inside the tiles and the tiles are closed with rivets. Before buying Magna-Tiles I researched other brands and saw that the magnets were not secure enough to prevent possible removal by a child and were a swallowing hazard.  Manga-Tiles are a better bang for your buck than the less expensive brand tiles because they are safer and more durable than other brands.

She instantly figured out how to build cubes and pyramids and she said, ""I'm a cube builder!  I'm a pyramid builder!""
