0,5.0,play roller coaster,My 4 year old grandson rides this over and over and over.  You'd think this wouldn't be such a draw... but it wins when he is bored with the bounce house or the swing.  I am guessing he'll be too big next year but I have sister that runs a small day care - so I plan to donate it to her.  Win/Win.  It went together quickly and easily.  Took my husband about 10 minutes.  The sections sort of pop in together and stay together even when moved. The &#34;drop&#34; track runs about 6 ft... we have sand so the car slows quickly at the bottom. The track can be taken apart for storage.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,1530738352750,7,True

So simple, in fact, that we typically take it apart between uses. No plastic bags full of parts, no novel booklet of instructions, no pounding our heads against the wall, no cursing in frustration. Already a winner before we even let our daughter play with it!<br /><br />We use this toy outside and it has not only been a hit with our 17 month old daughter, but it has been the most-fought-over toy at all of our summer BBQs this year, for young toddlers through 5 year olds!  We even found younger babies (9 months-ish) happy to push the wheeled coaster around the grass, using it like a walker.<br /><br />I was worried about the lifespan of this product, unsure how long it would be until my daughter outgrew it.

It is low enough to the ground that the I can see any real injuries happening.<br /><br />This is definitely worth the money we spent.

It requires no batteries, basically just operates with a little push and gravity.  The kids give themselves the push, but I do feel like I need to stay close by for the children under three.  The most important thing is to teach the children to get the back wheels into the designated holes on the track otherwise the car could fall off the track.  The two year olds and three year old understood this right away, the 1 year old does not, but that is fine; that's why I am right next to him when he wants to go on this ride.

It does seem a tad overpriced. I wish the little steps leading up to the cart were a bit bigger, but that isn’t enough to dissuade me from this purchase. When considering size, make sure you have an area wide enough for the cart to roll beyond the coaster itself.

Once the kid goes down the roller coaster they push the car back up the ramp.  There should be a platform on the side for the child to walk around the car and get onto the car instead of stairs on both sides.  Stairs on the other side would be nice.

It's well made and couldn't possibly be any easier to put together. I was nervous it wouldn't be safe or would be too fast but not at all. It seems very secure and safe. The ONLY thing I don't like is that there isn't any type of rail on the back for the child to hold onto while they're getting on it. A few times my daughter was trying to get on and she holds onto the car (because it's the only thing available) and accidentally pushes it. Luckily I'm always close enough to keep her from falling (now I just hold the car for her while she gets on) but I'd really like her to be able to use this without me having to stand over her the whole time. Adding a small support bar on the back for children to hold on to would make the product perfect. Otherwise, it's a great product and more than worth the price.

I thought it might be too big for our space but we used it inside and out and it is worth every inch of space it takes up. It keeps kids moving and playing and so very happy. Our 2 year old loved it and our 4 year old did too. We kept it outside during all kinds of weather and it held up well. This is such a great active toy for little ones. No one ever fell off and other than keeping kids out of the way at the end of the ramp we never had any issues.<br /><br /> The car itself is yellow, has a seat with a high back to make little ones more secure.

99,4.0,A lot of fun but novelty wore off,"We bought this for our children as a Christmas gift this past year.  My son was 3.5 years old and my daughter was 15 months old at the time.  The 15 month old was able to ride it without any problems.<br /><br />We had envisioned using it inside but you will need a lot of space to do that. The track itself is quite long and the cart needs extra space to ride after it comes off the track. After Santa came, we set it up in the hallway for a while (we have a small house).  The cart would go careening into the couch and we had to put pillows in front of it so the kids' falls would be broken.  We then stored it in the basement and took it upstairs for a change. Unless you have an enormous house you will not want this set up in your normal space. Luckily it is easy enough to put together and take apart.<br /><br />We now keep it outside and it holds up perfectly well.  We have it set up on a hill so the cart rides down the track and then down the hill.  It makes for a longer and more exciting ride.  I actually think it is better as an outside toy anyway, especially when set up near a hill.  It is kind of like summer sleigh riding.<br /><br />Both of them love it but, after the novelty wore off they use it more lightly.  The swing set is used far more heavily than this.<br /><br />My only gripe is that I wish two kids could fit on this instead of one.  I also kind of regret not buying the extreme one instead since we have this set up outside anyway and that one looks more exciting.  The downside of that one is that it would require a more permanent location since it is bigger and more laborious to move.  Also it is double the price (and size) so more is at stake if the novelty wears off and the kids don't use it much.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fun toy but don't expect your kids to use it all the time.  It takes up a great deal of space for something that is not used that often.  Nonetheless, it is a very exciting gift for a kid to get and it is fun when they have friends over for play dates.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AFIHPFIZXC72VUCPMVGRLMMJTPMA,1377226591000,9,True

151,5.0,a family favorite,"We purchased this for our son's second birthday present. We gave it to him the morning of his birthday party, so that we could have it set up for the kids to all play with that day. He loved it so much, that it is not only the only thing that he wanted to play with that day, but he refused to get off it to open the rest of his gifts... sharing was difficult that day. Luckily, some of our other ride on toys worked on it as well, so the kids were all able to have their own car to ride down in, and then they just waited in line. Much easier than having them all share the one rider (because, you know, toddlers). Our friends son left crying because he wanted to keep riding this as well. They bought this the next day for him.<br /><br />One of the nice features on this is that there are stairs on either side, which make it easier for the kids to get up and down. I also really like that it is five pieces total (including the car), so being able to store it in the shed is easier when you can tetris the pieces.<br /><br />We have now had the step 2 up & down roller coaster for one year. It is still a favorite, but not the only thing he plays with (thankfully). We keep this out in the yard set up all summer long, and I have been very impressed that the colors have not faded. A lot of our plastic childrens toys tend to fade in the sun over time. While I am sure that this might eventually fade, it has not in the one year that we have had it.

184,5.0,A Bit Of A Let Down... Then Up... Then Down... Then...,"So, if you've been to Six Flags and found those roller coasters a bit too scary then this could be the very thing for you. On my last trip to Six Flags I threw up 5 times... and that was only on the bus on the way there! The little old lady sitting next to me wasn't very pleased, mainly because it was her I threw up on most of the time. (Well I didn't have a sick bag or anything and she was wearing a multi-colored dress and I didn't think she'd notice). Anyway, for some crazy reason, she got all annoyed and moved to another seat, but not before telling me that back in her day the standard of vomit was a lot better than it is now and you could buy a whole bag of it and still get change out of a nickel.<br /><br />It wasn't until I actually put this roller coaster together that I realized that it was only a toy but, always ready for a challenge, I decided to give it a go anyway. First I had to go on a crash diet to lose enough weight to fit in it. My crash diet involved buying a week's worth of groceries, loading them into my car, and then crashing my car into the river, so I wouldn't be able to eat any of them. This crash diet worked great and after 5 weeks of eating nothing I had lost almost 120lbs. I had also lost all the money in my bank account because I had to buy a new car every week. Then I realized I was too tall to fit in the roller coaster.  No problem, I thought. I don't walk that much these days. So I cut both my legs off and donated them to my local Burger King. So, now weighing in at an unhealthy 40lbs and being only 3 foot tall, I was all ready for the thrill of my life. Then, after all that,  I saw that this was only for ages 3-5  – bummer.<br /><br />So if any one has a time machine I'd still love to try this out.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AF66EFMDQMO7NC7SILNNQKKWVXDA,1469409656000,1,False

249,5.0,Fun for little ones!  I don't think it'll keep attention past 3-4yo though.,"Got this for my 2yo and 3yo who are 95+ percentile size wise for their ages.  I'd say this is a good starter, but I don't know how long it will entertain them.  They are not daredevil kids by any means, but they aren't timid either.  The biggest win of all was that it taught them to take turns.  Until now they just bickered mostly!  Anyway, packaging was great, assembly took 2 minutes, and the kids were ready to hop on and go.  That's a huge plus!  I would definitely recommend for 1yo walkers-2yo.

250,4.0,crowd pleaser,"Bought this for Christmas 2012 for our 22 month old.  Initially he was hestitant, but after he saw the other kids getting on (including my 6 year old) he enjoyed it.  If you have space for this toy, it would be ideal to leave out.  I find that he rides it about 6-7 times and then moves onto something else.  As a side benefit, it teaches sharing and waiting your turn - as there is only one car.  It is very easy to put together/take apart, but who really wants to do that bc you still have to find a place to store the parts.  It goes just the right speed and older kids seem to enjoy it too - it was a great purchase.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AHUMFG7NN7QU3ZNVQ6NXUZRF6KUA,1360011106000,2,True

252,5.0,The kids love it!,"My children (3.5 and 2 years) received this from Santa this past Christmas and love it!<br />The toy is bright and colourful and very durable.  We've had the roller coaster inside on our tiled hallway and outside on pavers, a cement garage floor and a grass area.  Obviously your choice of surface will determine how far the coaster will continue rolling after you leave the track.  And the speed at which you go will be determined by how big a push you give yourself (or someone gives you).  We are able to control the speed for younger riders while the older ones can go as fast as they like.<br />The car you ride on is easy to climb on to with the wide steps at the top of the track.  The wheels make a great wooden roller coaster sound as it goes along ""clickety clack, clickety clack"".  The seat has a high back so your child has no chance of falling off backwards, with a good sized handle to grip and a space for feet to be placed so they are off the ground as you go ""whooshing"" down the track.<br />It is so easy to put together  - my three old can do it (but I always check she's lock everything together properly) and the children worked out straight away how to ride it and how to push the car back up the track and put the wheels in the little wheel holder up the top so it's ready for the next rider.<br />The children love it!  They have so much fun sharing it with each other and their friends.  It teaches them to take turns as well.  But it's just not used as a roller coaster.  They use the track to walk along practising their balance, they use the car to ride around the yard.  The walk up and down (and up and down) the steps.  I've also seen cars get zoomed up and down - everything from Tonka trucks, matchbox cars and Little People.<br />Highly recommended!

This is not to say that the toy in unstable, quiet the opposite but my son has had a few episodes of lets say over exuberant behaviour that have resulted in some near misses) You do need to mindful that it will take up a reasonable amount of storage space when not in use but it can easily be stacked.  It's so quick to put together, nice and stury, plesant colours and the car can be used separately from the track.  We have a another baby on the way and this is hopefully going to help save my sanity in those last few weeks when I'm not up to running around the park for more than an hour.

On rainy or snowy days, it's great to send them down there and they find their way to this toy, even now. It is still durable enough to hold them but also they can use it for other purposes (they use the car to pretend they are skateboarding (sitting down).  When they were younger, you would have to supervise them pretty closely since we didn't want any one of them running over the other but that is the case with any toy at that age.<br /><br />For other reviewers who claim it's not used enough, I'd recommend putting it away for a while and taking it out at certain times only.

437,5.0,Most thrilling indoor toy ever with some drawbacks,"As you might imagine, there are a few drawbacks to this toy. I'll list them before the praise.<br /><br />First, kids under 3 are going to occasionally hurt themselves. It's recommended for children 2-5, but, let's be honest, if you have an 18-month-old that can walk, you're going to put them on it. They can ride it and will love it, but they will need help getting on; they have to learn to hold their feet up on the car or out to avoid the wheels; and they occasionally forget the need to hold on to the bar. We use a loader and a catcher (mom and dad) for anyone under 3. Even a three-year-old will occasionally just fall off while getting on or run into another kid, if more than one kid present. But the toy is designed low enough to the ground that injuries should be more tears than actual bruises (unless you use it outside on your concrete driveway).<br /><br />Second, the toy takes a lot of space if you use it indoors, or even if you just plan to store it someplace when it's not being used.<br /><br />Third, this type of activity can often be short-lived. Don't buy this and expect it to be used every day for hours. My kids didn't play with it every day, so I started keeping it in the garage and bringing it out for special occasions like rainy days and visiting friends. They kids will play with the coaster for about 15-20 minutes each, at the most.<br /><br />Fourth, you'll need to closely supervise the use of this toy, especially if there's more than one kid playing with it. For kids under 4, you may be doing a bit of work yourself in getting them on and pushing them back to the top. For the older kids, you may just referee and make sure that nobody stands in front of the track.<br /><br />Now that may sound like a lot of negatives for a toy that I rated a 5, but you simply cannot have this much active fun inside the house without a trampoline or a really big ball pit. For children ages 2 and 3, this toy is more exciting than most adults would expect. The coaster is a solid construction and easy to put together and take apart in seconds. It even holds an adult should you want to test it out for yourself. Even older kids 5-6 love it, but you have to watch them a little as they try to increase the fun by doing more daring things like going down backwards. Finally, the editorial review was exactly right-the car does get used separately from the track and (when I kept my track out all the time) the kids played on it with matchbox cars and balls on a daily basis (it just took too much space in our play room). I wish they made toys like this when I was a kid.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AEVXWPQWY3ICQ3XPFVWIISAF2VIA,1109136065000,733,False

464,5.0,One of the most fun toys we own,"This toy is fantastic.  My kids always loved playing with this at other homes, so I finally got one.  I have watched kids ranging in age from 1 to 8 waiting in line for a ride.  I'm generally pretty risk averse, but this toy is fairly low to the ground, does not move very quickly, and the dip seems to really thrill the kids.  After all of the hours I've watched children play on this, I have never seen anyone fall off.  Also, since the ride is very quick and the car is easy to push back up, three or four preschoolers can easily play on this together without fighting.<br /><br />This is a pretty big toy, so for most people, this best fits outside, where the kids will also run up and down the hills and scoot the little car around.  If your ground isn't perfectly flat, the toy seems to work well anyway.  It's light, and my kids have moved this thing all over my lawn.  Like all Step 2 products, it's also incredibly well made.  Even though this toy is usually outside, I haven't heard of a single person who threw their roller coaster away because it broke.  Instead, they get passed down over and over again as kids sadly realize their legs are too long to even try riding this thing anymore.<br /><br />If you want to get a young child a gift they will adore and their friends will adore, buy this.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AERFQ72MURN5YEK7VAXC7YVJCQUQ,1404523401000,0,False

We set him in the car and held on to him for the first few rides, after that he was hooked!  He plays with this toy every day.  He quickly learned to climb the steps and get in the car on his own.  He also really liked just walking up and down the track which I think helped with his balance alot, and he enjoys pushing the car down the track and watching it go and pushing it back up the track.  Now he is 22 months old and has no problem pushing the car back up the track for another ride, or as he says, ""a wide"".  Balls and cars roll down the track nicely too.  He will stand at the end of the track and I will roll cars to him.  He loves it!  He is a really rough player and this toy still looks new.

548,5.0,Excellent Toddler Fun!,"Chose this as a gift for our son's 2nd birthday. His daycare has one outside. We have ours set up in our long playroom. It comes down to a rug and he knows to stop himself before he hits the overstuffed chair. For the first few days, we set up a big couch cushion as the ""crash"" zone. This comes apart and goes together very quickly and easily, so we can stow it away when we need a break or need some floor space for other activities. Our 5 year old can also ride this. The weight limit is 50 pounds. We're looking forward to having this outside in nicer weather.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer who said this is not something that gets used every day for hours and hours. Still, all of our kids (the two who can ride and the two who are too big for it) have fun sending dolls and stuffed animals down on the coaster car and our son loves to send Little People vehicles and other small trains and cars down the ""mountain road"" like the one into our Vermont town.

What I did was show him the car BY ITSELF, FIRST, without the ramp. I let him get on it, while I gently pushed him around the house, and got him familiar keeping his feet up and holding onto the bar, then I observed whether he would play with the car himself---he did, he got on it himself several times and I showed him how to ride the car along using his legs. A couple of hours later, as we distracted him with something eles, his grandad quickly set up the roller coaster and positioned the car ready for the first ride, we brought our grandson back into the living room. He was big-eyed and obviously excited as he ran to the big colorful long ramp. He immediately put his feet up on the car and held on to the bar and then came the BIG SMILE and WHEEEE!!! He kept wanting to go again and again! He now instinctively knows to position his hands and feet on the cute little car and has been enjoying it since, without incident of letting go or bringing his feet down that would cause a tumble! I would highly recommend introducing the child to the car first! Enjoy!",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AFE4MC2325CFM6P4JQWCQUSLXE3Q,1247248323000,0,False

And if the aren't using the car that comes with it, they will run down the hills, send other toys down the hills and slide down backwards...it has been a very versatile toy so far!  The only complaint I have heard from my boys is that it would be a lot more fun if it was higher (more steep of a slope).

931,5.0,Big fun for small people,"I'm so glad to see they are making this toy again.  I was trying to snag a used one for a while but the only one I found locally was missing one of the purple steps, and I couldn't get a replacement because they weren't making it for a while.<br /><br />My girls (4yo) love to play with this in the child care at the mall, but it was rationalized as a birthday gift for my newly 1yo.  At 14 months he is small and just barely starting to toddle but he is very happy on this.  We put him on and push him down the hill and he laughs.<br /><br />The girls have a blast on it, too.  They're pretty average in size for 4yos and fit but are about the upper end of useful size if that makes sense.  My 8yo can even ride but he looks ridiculous and does not have as much fun as he would if he fit.  (Not sure I want to spring for the giant outdoor one!)<br /><br />I'd say this is BEST for ages 1-4.  Get it young to get the most use out of it.<br /><br />Assembly is super duper easy - no tools, just snap together.  Everything comes ready to go, you don't even need to put stickers on.<br /><br />Dis-assembly is also easy, if you don't want to have it out all the time.<br /><br />The actual toy takes up ten feet and 2-3 inches past that but you will also want a good 5 feet of room to keep going - make sure you have the room if you plan to use this indoors.  A good 15 feet.  Probably more if you plan to use it on a hard floor.<br /><br />Simple, sturdy, no batteries, lots of fun.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AF6BAP7PONMFFA5LTZZY7SN6ANDA,1339170304000,3,True

This is the perfect gift for children in the age range of 2-12.  It does require supervision when older children join in on the fun.

This was all she wanted to do so when we came home, it was Amazon to the rescue.  The slide was a lot less expensive that I thought it would be and proved to be worth every $$$.  It gets lots of use and my daughter is learning to balance herself, listen when we tell her to hold on and pick up her feet, etc.  She's learning to do what we ask of her and it's encouraging to see her listening.  She is learning what it means to wait your turn and share when she wants to include her animals and dolls.  She is taught to only take one because there is no basket to place a doll/toy and we make her hold on with two hands at all times.<br /><br />Another ride on choo-choo train toy fits so she uses both interchangeably. The center piece can be removed for a shorter distance slide. I want to buy another center piece to make it longer for her when the weather allows us to take it outside.<br /><br />What I would have liked to see - 1.

It is fantastic toy - well built, durable, and easy to use. Surprisingly, the kids equally enjoy both the downhill ride as well as the return ride.  Rather than needing an adult to reset the cart for the next ride, they insist on doing it all by themselves - great! They get a nice long ride when they set it up outdoors on their gently-sloped paved driveway.  (Their mom has also let them use it inside their house with no problem.)  Their parents were pleased to note that the kids have no trouble sleeping after getting a great workout with this toy. One year later, the kids (now at 3 and 5 years old) still enjoy using it.

1240,5.0,"Versatile, active, educational, and fun!","Yes this is a roller coaster and a wonderful indoor ride but it also has the elements of an exceptional educational toy for both brain and body development.  It is easy to set up and move and use indoors providing active indoor play, but it is also easy to move outdoors during good weather and easily cleaned to return inside when the weather changes.  Our grandchildren ages 12 months to 7 years all love to ride down the track and at each stage of their development they do different things as they ride.  The baby just giggles and goes forward and loves to be pushed back up the track. The almost 2 year old rides the car down the ramp, pushes it back up himself, and loves to ride the car around the house separately. The older children do stunt riding, backwards, on one knee, sideways etc. and love to put on stunt shows.  In addition to riding the car the children do amazing things on the ramp.  The baby slides down it, the toddler increases his balance and confidence getting up the steps and walking up and down the ramp.  They learn the physics principles of force and motion as they roll all sorts of balls up and down the ramp and also use it as a vehicle run. The 5 and 7 year old girls use it as a model runway when they are playing dolls and to show off their own, as well as the dolls, new clothes. This toy will last through several generations of children providing opportunities for creative play, motor skill development, and educational discovery and is well worth the price.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AGA5KUUNTBM23VRT4YAYQJI4YAAA,1377825212000,1,False

1245,4.0,I wish my toddler used it more.,"This looked like the most fun a kid could have...to me. I sucked up the price because I imagined my son playing on it for hours. My two and a half year old rides it occasionally but enjoys it much more when he can rope an adult into pushing him ""really fast"".  Now most of the time he uses it as a ramp for his cars and trains. Which I guess is okay too. My 11 month old boy enjoys crawling up and down on the track but occasionally there are fights as both of them want to use the track at the same time and can be dangerous if the little one gets in the way of the car.<br /><br />One thing about this expensive toy that has not lost it's charm after 3 months is the big box it comes in.  We cut out windows and a sky light to be Nate's ""house"" and his hide away from baby brother, it affords him a few minutes of peace anyway.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AEG5MLXY22TWGYBR7MG4ARHHUBAA,1149702402000,4,False

She can now ride it by herself, she pushes the coaster back up the track climbs on and goes again.  She still loves it!<br />Good for up to age 7 or 8. My friend tried it and liked it and she weights around 130+ pounds.  The older ones can ride on it and enjoy it as much as the younger children.  The track is also fun to roll things down such as balls and toy cars.  The car can be used without track also.  As a side note the car makes a clicking sound as you push it back up the track which sounds like a real roller coaster. (its darling)  Well worth the money and the amazing thing is that it is so durable it will be something that can be used for years.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AFUO4FMZCRELZSAZ65HC7NVAPE2A,1019818893000,114,False

1301,5.0,Best Fun,"Reading the negative reviews it would seem for some this presents with safety issues.<br /><br />I was desperate to purchase one of these for my grandaughter, finally they became available, so at 8 months she was off. Initially we just gave her the vehicle to get used to manoeuvring it around. Once we could see she had good control of the ""car"", we set up the track, indoors in the hall, on a tiled floor (for added speed). I must stress that I coached her constantly during this stage. It is imperative that they learn the keep their feet on the rest provided, otherwise I can well imagine that accidents will result. Once I was sure that she wouldn't balk with the downward motion, holding her posture, hands and feet correctly, I would stand at the end, giving her extra reassurance. Needless to say it was the best fun an 8 month old ever had!<br /><br />They love to have control, so instantly reason the best way up, is via the same route as down ie pushing the ""car"" back up the slide. One needs to ensure that they are aware of the little stoppers at the top, and  make sure they position the ""car"" safely before getting back on. It's not long before little ones (once beyond the over excited stage) handle this like a pro.<br /><br />Appropriate supervision is a must with any child,  they always need a little correction here and there, children will experiment, pushing boundaries, it's why we are an advanced species, it's inherent in our wiring.  Don't expect to leave them.  As she grew, we increased the degree of difficulty by setting it up on a grassy hill. Even now at 6 years old, there is an area (they have a large property) beside the house that has a long (150m/492') steep grassy slope, together with her  friends they have so much fun. They race each other, roller coaster v waterslide. AWAYS supervised, no one has ever hurt themselves. I can't imagine my grandaughter ever being out of sight of a competent adult.<br /><br />Amazon's price ($105) is excellent value, especially for a toy as durable as this (it does fade).  It endows child with great gross motor skills, an understanding of potential and kinetic energy, a bit of danger/bravery and a whole lot of fun.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AHDYA4DZZRR23SRWQAVNMIBPBZ6Q,1350784776000,1,False

It is always the star of the show anytime the kids of our friends come over. I can’t wait until it’s nicer outside to take it out there and see what kind of play he comes up with it then. We have baby number two on the way and expect this toy to stand the test of time and last us for years! Great investment and easy to put together or take apart. Yes, it takes up a good amount of room in the house but I think it’s worth it.

1346,5.0,Best present ever.,"This is the best present you could give a 3 year old. Her birthday this year fell on Easter. She has been playing with it now for more than 2 weeks now. She never gets bored of it. Her nephew who is 18 months comes over and it is always the first thing he wants to do. Ride on the roller coaster. My 3 year old can operate this all by herself. She can put the car on the top of the tracks, get on and push her self down the tracks. She usually plays with this for 30 minutes to an hour. The 18 month old needs help getting the car on and pushing himself down.<br />This was extremely easy to put together. It literally took about 2 minutes to put together. And because it is so easy to take apart and put together we are always taking it in the house and out of the house. When it rains they play with it in the house. So glad they now have something to do that keeps them entertain for a long time when it is raining outside. i am so happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GfoIbmZuL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GfoIbmZuL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GfoIbmZuL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VY8AcDAzL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VY8AcDAzL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VY8AcDAzL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WXmJkrHoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WXmJkrHoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WXmJkrHoL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gi9t14QiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gi9t14QiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gi9t14QiL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AELJIY2J26J3Z2NESYEJL37K75GA,1460658442000,37,True

He uses the rollarcoaster EVERY single day and if we dismantle it to set it aside he trys to pull it back out himself.

1514,4.0,Big & bulky but fun,I got this when my son was almost 18 months old but he was afraid of it at that age so we put it away for a while.  Now he is 21 months old and we got it out again and he likes it.  We have a small condo so we keep it in pieces in the garage and bring it outside to play each day.  It's kind of a pain to carry the big pieces out all the time and then put them away after my son only plays with it for 10 minutes but I'm still happy that we got it.  The little car that is included is the best part because it rolls easily and my son enjoys just pushing it around everywhere even without the track.  I feel this set is very durable and will not be outgrown quickly so it is worth the price.  Just make sure you have enough space because it is 10 feet long and then the car will go at least another 10 feet after that so we had to use it outside even though I wanted it for indoors.  I would say you need 20 feet of space for it at least though.  I like that it comes apart easily and you can choose to put only one of the stairs on if you want it against a wall or have limited space.  You can also interchange some of the track pieces to make it shorter but we never do that.  I would say buy it if you have the space!,[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AEAXTXXZ4NLDZW6B6FI4U2SOZOWA,1341710186000,2,True

I make sure they all are wearing a helmet. Even the middle schoolers like to play on it. It has been left out in the snow, been kicked, walked all over, had 4-5 six year old sitting on it at one time and it is still going strong and will probably last for several more years.

I love the sturdiness of it. I could store this after my son outgrows it and it would keep until his kids want to ride it. Or, I really think because it holds up so well, I could resell it for almost what I actually paid for it ($85 shipped). It has 3 big parts that make up the slide that fit easily into each other. The purple stairs on either side slide under the green top part, and then you have the car. That's it. We have a long living room, so we just set it up in the kitchen and let him slide across the room. We put a couple rugs underneath to not disturb the neighbors. It's great. We've had it for 7 months now and when it's set up, he'll still hop on it 5 times throughout the day...more if we give him a push from behind (because then he goes faster). He also uses it to slide his cars and other toys down. Good investment!",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AHK4C6YI73ZAZGRSYFUWUBHCVEWQ,1278079808000,0,False

The back wheels ""lock"" into shallow indents to keep the car from scooting away while she climbs on.  On flat ground, the car keeps going after it leaves the track, about as far as the length of the roller coaster itself. It is fun to see the big smiles on her face when she's riding.

He did not want to get off. He got on it at least 10 times the first day I put it together. However, it did look a little uncomfortable for him to put his legs up and he is only 36&#34;.

I didn't even buy it but received as a gift and am absolutely thrilled with the product. My soon to be 2 year old son beams each time he rides down the track and it never gets old! He very quickly learned to put the riding car back on top of the slide, use the steps, climb on the toy, and propel himself down independently so we just get to relax and enjoy watching him, or we can get stuff done while supervising him. The product is bulky but can be taken apart and stored if needed. Seems sturdy and was absolutely a cinch to put together -- took about 10 seconds literally and I am all thumbs with these things. Additionally something else I LOVE is that the riding toy and ramp can  be used either together but they are both so fun for my son individually too. Balls and trucks can be slid down the ramp and the riding car can be taken outside on the sidewalk with close supervision.

The first day we brought ours home, our 14 month old had taught herself to climb the steps, hang onto the handle bars, and push herself off to get the coaster to move. The steps are easy for a little child to climb, and even if they fall, it's a VERY short distance, I sincerely doubt a child could get hurt on this. Our little one is now 17 months old, and the fun factor has not worn off.  She  now can push the coaster back to the top of the ramp, to go for another ride.....she's very independant, and this toy has been perfect for her.  I think it's helped her and her urge to do everything on her own, and since it's an easy toy for children to crawl on, play with, they CAN do it on their own! Durable, easy to assemble, it maybe took us all of 5 minutes to get it together, and it moves easily.  Washable, and our dogs have put the coaster and track to the torture test, too....you cannot hurt this toy! Highly suggest buying this.  Plus, when she outgrows it, I know it'll hold up a long time, to be passed on to another child.  Also, the coaster car can be ridden off of the coaster track, making it double as a great first ""bike"".  We often see our little one riding it around the yard!",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AGH4VQ7UIUSULVCSLG4IRK75L23Q,1014139375000,28,False

Well, it is amazing. She has fallen off of it a couple times, but it is about a foot high, so, who cares? She actually got a bunch of bubble wrap and put it at the end to fall into on purpose. She is going up and down it over and over and can do it all by herself. That means I don't have to do ANYTHING which is great because I have a newborn who needs to be fed every two hours. It is an exciting toy that makes her feel special amidst the new change in our house!!",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AEVJCQ4CTUCQED6PJU4WIPGZ2HFA,1363213565000,0,False
1892,5.0,Sturdy and easy to disassemble.,"18 months to 2 year old boy enjoys thrilling ride. Originally had it set up in long hall in house on hardwood floor, so it rolled a good little distance. Would always recommend supervision as it does go pretty fast. If you move it outside, I would recommend child wear a helmet for protection. The roller coaster slide is a colorful, sturdy molded plastic in 3 parts that easily slide into slots and are secured. The highest level has a  stand on either side of slide that has slots to secure slide and a step. Easy step up for toddler but should be supervised. The coaster is sturdy rolling car and has a small place to put feet while riding down the ""slide"". It can also be used as a scooting ride separably. The trickiest part is when the toddler steps up onto the step and then onto the coaster car. The car has wheels and can slide- so use caution and supervision. The slide starts high and then dips, the rises slightly and dips again before rolling to the ground. My tot likes to turn slide over and play in the underside portion as well. He also climbs the slide. It is easily broken down tho it is a large toy that needs amble space to set up and to store. It can be pushed fairly easily when assembled. The coaster can roll on grass too. Older kids can ride as well. Would recommend. Have had for about a year now.",[],B00005KBVD,B08JXJHZR8,AHJLM7MFBNCCRJXMANO2VEXNK77Q,1566044631347,1,True

She had no fear of it, jumped right in the car and down the coaster she went, with the BIGGEST smile on her face!  She continued to do it nonstop for about 45 minutes!  (That is a lifetime for the attention span of a two year old!)<br /><br /> She even had her roller coaster face down pat...everytime she would climb on the car her mouth was open wide and she would scream - waiting for someone to push her (she can now get it going by herself).  And then continue screaming and smiling all the way down.  Then she would push it up the track all by herself and climb back on.<br /><br /> Needless to say I highly recommend this toy..it does take up alot of space (you will need a few feet after the track cause it does keep going!), but it is easy to take apart and put back together for storage.

Prior to purchasing it I was a little nervous because the coaster is recommended for 2-5 year-ols, but after we saw it we couldn't pass it up.  She needed a little help getting on it when we first gave it to her, but within two weeks she was doing it on her own. By the time she was 16 months old she could push it up the track herself (with supervision).  This is the only toy at our house that gets played with every single day.  All the children that visit our house love it and if I put it away it is the first thing they ask for when they come in.  My daughter has also learned alot about sharing with this toy.  Since it has a set start and finish it is great for taking turns.  They also enjoy walking on the track and rolling cars and balls down it.<br />I would definately recommend this toy; however, they do take up pretty much space and toddlers need to be well surpervised when using this.

When he stops he stays on the car, and I push him backward back up the track. He makes me do it over and over...tiring, but definitely worth it.<br /><br />Now, be warned, this thing is HUGE! I initially set it up in the house...yeah...that lasted two days. I cleaned out the garage and it now stays there, which works out better since he can ride down the coaster, then roll down the driveway for more length. I ABSOLUTELY recommend this (though check out Wal-mart, it's cheaper). The only downside I've found is that my son cries and cries when it's time to get off.
