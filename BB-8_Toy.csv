0,1.0,"BB-8, you're no R2-D2!",Amazon is about the only place I've seen candid accurate reviews of this BB-8. For the price this is a poor product designed in a short timeframe and rushed to market.  The only function that really works well is &#34;Drive&#34;.  Other features like &#34;Patrol&#34; I would expect BB-8 to learn where objects are when it hits them. But it doesn't it just keeps running into them time after time. Some of the voice commands like go explore or look around hardly do anything. The R2-D2 interactive Astromech droid I've had for 10 years which has infrared and sound sensors is much more intelligent than this droid.  Online there is a BB-8 Users Manual but it offers no detail for any of the functions. Maybe with future firmware and app software updates this can be made to be a good product but at this point I'm going to return it while I still can. Perhaps I will have A New Hope when there is another thats more capable than this initial release version.,[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1442264974000,58,False

12,4.0,Interesting toy but has some flaws and drawbacks to consider,"Bought this for grandchildren and think they will have fun with it.  Reason for three stars is that I find on thick pile or even some thin carpets that it slows to a crawl if it moves at all.  I have wall to wall carpeting with orientals and it has trouble climbing from the wall to wall onto an oriental.  But on hardwood or other had flooring it is a speedy little droid.  No instructions come with the droid other than pictures that do not tell you much. You can go on their site and click on links and only then will you find some useful information e.g., that you are supposed to set it on hard surface and attach head until magnets find it, that you need a full charge before first use, that it has a lithium battery so unlike NiCad does not need to be drained before recharging.  That there is a reset button the side of the base.  Have not had to use it but only found reference to that in comments under their link, not in link itself.  That the charge to play ratio is 3:1 e.g., 3 hours of charging to 1 hour of play.  The user manual unfortunately is filled with little but warnings and cautions and while that is useful an operating manual would be very helpful.  I am still not sure I have found all the features.  Sent an e mail to support about this and got no response other than an e mail telling  me issue was solved!  Not terribly supportive!  I printed out the page from the links on their support page on the voice commands but an operating manual with all these that you could print would be a big help.  Obviously you cannot be looking at their links at the same time you are operating the droid.  Some have pointed out that it is small but I have no problem with that.  Younger children will find easier to handle and on hard floors it does run like crazy.  Wondered what my dog, a Jack Russell, would think of it but he tends to ignore it. Watches it go by but does not find interesting enough to chase.  More curious than anything but leaves it alone.  Have not had problem of head falling off that others have mentioned but can see if hit a wall or table leg  at top speed how that could happen. I agree with comments that camera on the droid would have been nice feature but I do not find the fact that sound is on the app device bothers me.  The hologram feature is interesting but limited in the built in features.  I agree with those commenting that it does not seem to have any learning or adaptive features; if so I have not found them.  True it will change directions if runs into an obstacle but it does not seem to learn anything in the process.  Not sure what they are talking about when they say it learns and adapts.  On the whole it is a fun toy even though pricey.  Will be interested to see how my grandchildren like it and whether it is something they will play with or tire of it quickly.  They say they will be adding features and will look forward to those upgrades.<br /><br />Added post Christmas.  Gave this item to my adult son for Christmas to play with his young daughters.  Found that they have added some added features.  Before the only hologram was a figure but now they have added a starfighter.  Of course you can add your own.  Also they have added several new features in the drive setting.  Wish they had BB-8 talking or making sounds more than it does.  Know some are bothered by sounds not coming from BB-8 but the device used to control it but while that would be nice it does not bother me.  The adults had fun playing with it and grandkids enjoyed watching and eventually they will learn to use it as well.  Dogs (more than one at Christmas) just ignored it which is probably good!  I was bit concerned that for the price this would be a one hour wonder. Fun for first hour and then put away.  But that was not the case so far.  As for size we all liked the smaller size.  One thing we did find that it was easiest to wake up BB-8 either on its stand or on a table. Putting on floor you have to bend over too  long for it to initialize. You have to hold the control app close to BB-8 to get it started.  Once it is wake and ready to go putting on floor then works fine.  As noted above works best on hardwood or other hard flooring and on some of my thicker carpets it would not go at all.<br /><br />Because of the fun my son and my daughter's boyfriend had with this at Christmas I am raising my stars from 3 to 4.  Reason for only four is that support needs to be better and they need an operating manual although perhaps until they finish adding features you would have to update that but even an operating manual now with occasional supplement and revision would be helpful.  Not all the features are intuitive or covered on their site.  And using your app device to control it you cannot be going back and forth to the links for information if needed.  Plus not everything is included there.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AFLO7QKN3WVVES5ASJ5PBDHMKZLQ,1450869201000,10,True

23,3.0,Okay if you know what you're getting,"I waited impatiently to get my own Sphero BB-8 App-Enabled Droid!  I had watched the Sphero product videos and was amazed at what this cute little guy can do.  I'm a gadget nerd and had to get my hands on this!  Unfortunately, my expectations were too high.<br /><br />First, let me start off by saying BB-8 is very cute.  That part is true.  I love the look, the design and the shiny finish.  It is made of plastic, but appears to be good quality.  It's very user friendly and you can be playing with BB-8 within minutes.  The only set-up required is to charge BB-8 and download the app.<br /><br />What can BB-8 do?  Once you download the free app, you can:<br />&quot;Drive&quot; This feature of the app lets you control BB-8 as if you were using a joystick.<br />&quot;Message&quot; Record and play holographic messages.<br />&quot;Patrol&quot; When you select patrol, BB-8 goes exploring on his own.<br /><br />BB-8 has the capability of responding to 10 preset voice commands by going to the settings in the app, such as &quot;wake up&quot;, &quot;watch out&quot;, &quot;go explore&quot; &quot;go to sleep&quot;.  I was expecting more than 10 voice commands.  Siri has spoiled me.  I have heard, but cannot verify, that the voice commands only work with iOS devices.  If this is accurate, that's a huge drawback for anyone without an iPhone or iPad.<br /><br />BB-8 is very cute (I know, I'm saying it again), has a great personality and is entertaining to watch as he rolls across the floor.  That is about the extent of the entertainment.<br /><br />I feel I was misled by the promotional videos.  I was under the impression that BB-8 can &quot;detect&quot; when he is going to run into an object, stop himself and change directions; or, perhaps, adapt to his surroundings and learn where objects are.  My impression of this came from the part in one of the promotional videos where BB-8 rolls up to a fishbowl with a goldfish in it, stops before hitting it and changes direction.<br /><br />When I set BB-8 to &quot;patrol&quot;, he wobbles around a bit, rolls quickly across the floor, hits a wall or other object, wobbles around again, rolls across the floor, hits another object, etc.  It's entertaining to watch and the expressive sounds are fun, but after about 5 minutes I'm bored.  The worst part of this is BB-8's head falls off frequently when running into an object so I'm constantly following him around to put it back on.  Also, if you have stairs in your house as I do, watch out!  BB-8 will roll right down the stairs and I'm not sure if he's sturdy enough to bounce down the stairs and land on a tile floor without breaking.  I've &quot;saved&quot; BB-8 an untimely death a few times now.  Again, this falls under my misunderstanding of thinking BB-8 will adapt to his surroundings or detect a drop off.  I have a robotic vacuum that didn't cost much more than BB-8 and has that very capability.  It knows to turn around to avoid crashing down the stairs.  It also vacuums right up to the edge of walls and furniture, but never actually touches it.  Hmmmm.......<br /><br />Next is the issue with the sound.  Again, my expectations being different than reality.  I thought the sounds would come from BB-8, when really the sounds all come from your smartphone.  Very disappointing!  I'll set BB-8 on &quot;patrol&quot;, set my smartphone down in one room and let BB-8 go explore the house.  I don't get the enjoyment of hearing the sounds if I don't carry my phone with me and it's not as realistic even if your phone is right next to BB-8 because you can easily tell no sound is coming from him.  This is perhaps the biggest disappointment.<br /><br />Finally, the holographic messages.  I thought it would be like in the movie and BB-8 would project a recorded message onto the wall or what-not and play the recorded message.  The message only shows up on your smartphone.  When using the app through a Motorola smartphone (and others), this feature doesn't work at all.  I don't know if it's something that there will be a fix for in the future?  It does work on an iPhone and other devices, but is still disappointing that BB-8 isn't really projecting anything.<br /><br />This is a very expensive toy and the novelty wears off very fast, especially if you're expecting something more and it doesn't deliver.  If you're a Star Wars Memorabilia collector, you've probably made up your mind and probably should purchase it.  If you're like me and love Star Wars but aren't a collector and/or your a gadget nerd like me, you'll probably be disappointed.  There's not much to it besides watching it roll around the floor, crashing into things.<br /><br />To summarize the Pros:<br />Very Cute!<br />Realistic looking miniature version of BB-8<br />Great novelty item for Star Wars Collectors<br />Cool Gadget<br />Easy Set-Up<br />Fun Sound Effects<br /><br />To summarize the Cons:<br />Entertainment won't last long<br />Doesn't detect obstacles or objects in it's way<br />Head falls off<br />Doesn't sense drops to prevent it from falling down the stairs<br />Sound doesn't come from droid<br />Holographic messages are really just a video on your smartphone ~ if your smartphone is compatible<br />Only 10 voice commands<br />Voice commands may only work with iOS devices<br />Price is too high for what you really get","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-2aVYsLWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-2aVYsLWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-2aVYsLWL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Al9DvhpDL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Al9DvhpDL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Al9DvhpDL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ducgbtf8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ducgbtf8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ducgbtf8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IPQFnSf9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IPQFnSf9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71IPQFnSf9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AEZ24PPURN2NCJVC6UXKZEJGWMPA,1451372698000,1528,True

As for my BB8 experience, it was fun and I would recommend to any fan along with my story.  I think it's a bit expensive for the fun it offers though.  My kids played with it for a few weeks and then lost interest.  That's true of many toys though.

42,3.0,Overpriced. Much much smaller than expected. Nothing life-changing.,"Clever and cute, but abusively priced in the classic Disney way.<br /><br />The box this came in looks about the right size, I assumed this little guy could be about the size of a naval orange/soft ball and it's not... it's about 1/2 that size... it's tiny.<br /><br />My first two thoughts were:<br /><br />1. Why the heck was the box so big for _that_?<br />2. Why did I just pay $120 for _that_?<br /><br />It works well with your phone (you use an app to control it) and has cute little behaviors like moving around randomly when you stop controlling it - giving it a little personality. I have NO idea if you had it on a desk if it would just scoot it's way off the edge, we have only played with it on the floor.<br /><br />The head is magnetically attached - it works well - my only complaint would be that it doesn't slide across the surface of the ball super smoothly so it sort of jerks a little as the ball rolls.<br /><br />Buy this because you or the person you are giving it to LOVES Star Wars/BB8/etc. - if none of those statements are true, you might feel let down.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHU2HRI7DAFC6NV3BPBB26UCJPCQ,1480249984000,5,True

So he is more capable if you are more capable.

Seriously- this was a gift and I paid a bit more for it than other sellers asked because it would arrive by Christmas.

The bad thing is that once the head rollers get gunk on them (after maybe an hour of use on a clean floor), the head movement is effected and gets very jerky.<br /><br />All in all, I think it's absolutely adorable but given the cons, I would not purchase again - at least not at the $150 price.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHUTJQRG6X2VB56TS7OJZ4BMMSBA,1449624680000,9,False

I didn't buy mine here because I received it as a Christmas present but I will say that this is a decent little toy that is fun to get out every now and then, especially if you're showing it to someone for the first time. It has a pretty decent range as long as it's still in view but if you end up around a corner or it if goes between you and an obstacle like a piece of furniture you'll probably have to go and get it. It performs best on flat, smooth surfaces like the hardwood floors we have but it will also work on some carpeting but at a slower speed. One issue I had was with the app not working on my Droid Turbo 2 but I have a Samsung Galaxy 3 that I use for work and the app worked fine on that one. When I used it right out of the box I put it in the charger and it &#34;woke up&#34; right away and worked fine. The next day it didn't respond at all even after being in the charger all night but I had some help finding info online that helped troubleshoot it and it works just fine now. It's pretty sturdy but I wouldn't recommend it for small children because it can be difficult to get the hang of.

The only drawback is the controls through Bluetooth on a phone or tablet SUCK!  There is just a delay that drives you insane when your trying to run it.  If this was &#34;fixed&#34; it would be a way better toy.  It is just very hard to control him when your trying to maneuver him around table and chair legs, or whatever the obstacle may be.  I wish it would have come with its own remote control, that would have been a 5 star move in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't know why all these companies are trying to have you run everything through your tablet of phone.  There is just a miserable delay.  Now, maybe it may be our phones and/or tablet that is just slow getting the commands to BB8?  I'm not that deep of a tech guy.

Doesn’t work as well on thick carpet.<br />4) For fun if you have kids...  after you install the app, read the instructions and learn how to get BB-8 to answer “yes” or “no”. Let the kids ask it questions while you answer without them knowing. This provided about 30 min of fun and laughter for the young ones.  Then once the gig was up, they took control and started doing it with their friends.<br />5) Don’t skip the hologram mode. That was surprisingly cool.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy!",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AFIHNJU5ZBJM6JSSJQFAYQABNXRA,1547397079214,0,False

Once charged, and the APP downloaded to my wife's iPhone, we put the BB unit through it's paces.  It does take some getting use to, but it is fun and cute.  Our large tabby cat hates the droid, he looked at us with that &#34;you must be kidding me&#34; expression but didn't attempt to swat or tackle it.<br />To learn more about what others think about the droid, we watched a science video about the product.  First, except for the two antenna, it is solidly built into an 1/8&#34; thick-walled ball of high impact plastic.  To look inside they cut it with a bandsaw as nothing else would work.  Once out of the ball, the robot, yes it is a robot, was well built.  The maker, Orbotix, manufactures other robotic products, another BB-8 droid is due out soon.<br />Is it for everyone?

222,2.0,Thumbs down.,"Beware. The product has recently been downgraded so that the magnetism in the head is too weak. As a result EVERY TIME BB8 bumps into a wall (which is often) his head pops off. I had an original BB8 which was great. Then I lost the head when he went under the sofa which has low clearance. Couldn't find it again. So I ordered a replacement head. Ever since that time his head has popped off at the slightest provocation, whenever he hits a wall and even sometimes when he merely roles from a carpet to the hardwood floor, a drop of a tiny fraction of an inch. When I asked Sphero tech support they wrote me back that BB8's head will always pop off if he hits something. That's just a lie.  The original head did not pop off like this. Besides if they made a 'blind' robot that bumped into walls a lot and with a head that popped off each time, that would be unacceptable. I sent them a Youtube video I found of a Sphero BB8 demonstrating that what they said about the head always popping off was just completely untrue. So they asked for a video of mine with the head popping off. I sent them a video. I also asked for a new replacement head, hoping the new one would be better. They have not responded.<br /><br />Overall exhausting and exasperating.<br /><br />Update. They sent a new replacement head. It's not great but appears to be a little better than the last one.

Otherwise, you may end up with Star Wars collectible paperweight (albeit a very nice one) unless you go to the dark side of custom roms.<br /><br />Rather than repeat what is already written by the most helpful reviews, I just wanted to focus on a main issue I had with my BB-8.  Although my Android phone and tablet appeared to meet the hardware and software requirements listed on the Sphero BB-8 website, the Sphero BB-8 app itself would not install.  So, I suggest folks first attempt to install the app on your device BEFORE you purchase BB-8.  The app will not install unless it meets ALL of the hardware and software requirements, and just because it looks like your device meets the requirements, you won't know for sure until you attempt to install the app or it's on the list of know supported devices.  See the Sphero website for the compatibility list.<br /><br />MY EXPERIENCE WITH A 2012 GOOGLE NEXUS 7 TABLET<br />I have a 2012 Google Nexus 7 tablet running a supported version of Android.  However, the Sphero BB-8 app will not install because my tablet does not support &#34;Bluetooth LE&#34; (Low Energy).  I figured my table has Bluetooth so it will support Bluetooth &#34;LE&#34;.  I was wrong and spent much time researching what the heck is Bluetooth LE?!?I found that my tablet's hardware could support it, but Google chose not enable it.  So the only way to get it to work was to install a &#34;custom rom&#34; which is something that should only be attempted by advanced technical users and is not for the faint of heart (You could brick your device -- render it useless, lose all your data, etc. or worse, lose all your Candy Crush boosters :-P).<br /><br />MY EXPERIENCE WITH A 2013 SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI DUO PHONE<br />The app would also not install on my 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Duo.  AgaIn the device is running a supported version of Android but the app will not install and it's not clear to me why.  So , again the only alternative would be spend a lot of time trying to investigate what's missing and whether installing a &#34;custom rom&#34; will fix it (which I haven't attempted because BB-8 is working on my Nexus 7).<br /><br />LIKES AND DISLIKES<br />Other than the challenges of getting the app to work, I like but don't love my BB-8. I like the quality and detail and will enjoy it as a nice Star Wars collectible.  I wish it had better sensors and was easier to maneuver.  I don't see any evidence of &#34;artificial intelligence&#34; or &#34;adapting&#34; and hope either Sphero or some tech fans will create better apps for it.  I'm also concerned that the head pops off easily causing the thin antenna to bend and eventually.  As many other posters remarked, the marketing video is very misleading.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AFJ4MEOUB6MBE45YM32DC3SS2NTQ,1451973798000,0,False

Works great on the tile and hardwood, can go on the rugs if he has enough momentum.  As some other reviews said he can drop his head (it's held on by a magnet) but it's not every time he nocks into something.  So far it's only happened once for me.

249,4.0,Fun droid. Though there’s no voice control on Android yet the technology behind BB-8 is genuinely impressive.,"If you are a Star Wars fan or just a toy geek this droid is for you. Like Sphero's other toys, the BB-8 connects to iOS or Android devices (Sphero tweeted that it's working on Windows Phone support). Once paired, the companion app offers access to three modes: Driving, Holographic Messaging and Patrol. For the second mode, Sphero used its augmented reality engine to turn videos into Star Wars' trademark holo messages -- those are recorded and viewed on the application. Patrol, meanwhile, shows a real-time log of BB-8's movements, based on the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors from your smartphone or tablet. So even if it's just a toy, it encourages players to learn about programming.<br />The droid looks great and much easier to drive than I expected. At time of writing the Android app doesn't support voice commands yet even though it says it on the box. But it's meant to be coming soon in an update. Also, it would be a 5 star if the sounds come from the droid not on the phone. However, I really think a ‘toy’ with this kind of technology goes way beyond a mere toy. What Sphero has done is singlehandedly welcoming in a new generation of toy and consumable robotic technology.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHK6NO7WIJWGULJJYG5ZDDMU4X7A,1442124578000,3,False

Honestly, up the size a bit, strip the parts off a $50 Android phone and let it look with the camera, beep audibly, listen to voice commands, etc.<br /><br />If the hardware did all that you'd think it'd do, I'd happily pay double what they're asking, but this is just another toy to sit on my desk at work and do nothing now.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AE6MKQNRS5W32PMX6RZLVCYQTXVQ,1451955197000,0,False

318,4.0,BB-8 blew me away!,"HOURS AND HOURS OF SUPREME FUN!<br /><br />This toy comes very close to justifying it's high price tag!  It is easy to use (unlike many, many app controlled toys I have had in the past): easy to pair with a control device (you just start the app and hold it near the BB8 unit) and very controllable once you pair. Whether directly controlled or in patrol mode, it does a great job of capturing the character of BB-8 in the movie as well with over a dozen pre-programmed gestures and motions. I have not used the messaging features myself, but my kids (9, 9, & 6 yo) have spent several hours with it as well. While I was concerned about this being a 'single purpose' toy (you know the kind of toy where kids can only play with it one way and then lose interest after an hour or so), my kids keep coming back to it with creative uses, including role / scenario playing, building obstacle courses, and other creative uses (less often than they would like, since they need to borrow my phone to use it - see below).<br /><br />Battery life typically outlasts my phone (which admittedly has a very average battery, but the phone also doesn't have moving parts the way BB8 does).  While I wouldn't bounce it down the stairs, it has been durable so far even with my 6 year old's driving.  :)<br /><br />My only complaint is the limited number of supported control devices. Of the 10 iOS/Android/Kindle phones and tablets we have at our disposal, only TWO are capable of interfacing with it (hence the 4 stars).<br /><br />(WARNING: as of Dec 2015, NO KINDLE devices were supported.)",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHIA2UF7R3EFLZLGWJ2B53JPYQEQ,1452627310000,2,True

323,5.0,"Great technology, although not so much a ""toy"" as a working scale model","A few years ago, I bought my brother-in-law perhaps one of the most perfect presents a geek could give another geek--a Sphero remote-controlled ball. It was at the same time completely useless and completely amazing. While remote-control vehicles have been with us forever, it takes a true geek to appreciate the engineering that goes into creating a remote-controlled ball.<br /><br />I was wondering what Sphero would do for an encore. Whoever the marketing guy was that came up with the idea of approaching the Star Wars: The Force Awakens licensing team should be given a million dollars (although something tells he'll get that and more). It's a product licensing deal made in heaven--cutting edge technology used to make the hottest new droid character, the BB-8, come to life. My only hope for the company is that BB-8 turns out to be more like R2-D2 than Jar Jar Binks as far as how much it ends up being loved by the public.<br /><br />Like the Sphero ball, the BB-8 works right out of the box. You unbox it and place it on its dock that can be powered by any USB charger.  You then download the app from the Apple Store or Google Store. Place your phone or tablet near the unit and it'll recognize it automatically. Once that happens you can start controlling it right away. Unlike the Sphero ball, the BB-8 also has a &quot;head&quot; that's magnetically attached to the ball that remarkably stays on the top of the ball just like the 'real' droid's head.<br /><br />It takes a bit of getting used to controlling the BB-8. The app will show you two sets of joysticks. You swipe the right one to adjust a flashing blue LED light that animates within the unit, setting it to point directly to you. Once that's done, you control it using standard up-down-left-right joystick controls to the left.<br /><br />Controlling your BB-8 is lots of fun...just be forewarned that dogs, cats, and the luddites in your life may get just a little freaked out by it and run screaming from it. But everyone else will see it for the cute little robot that it is, It's of course smaller than the real one you see in the movies, but otherwise looks identical. We tried the BB-8 on a hardwood floor where it handled itself perfectly, but when it went onto a tatami mat, it started to get stuck. Best rule of thumb--if you can roll a ball on the surface, you can use the BB-8.<br /><br />After an initial phase of wonderment and awe just controlling it does get a little old rather quickly (unless you have a remote control car and decide to have drag races). I do like how they included additional features in the app. One is a messaging feature where you record a video message (think Princess Leia recording her message for Obi-Wan in R2-D2) and using augmented reality, when you point your phone's camera to the BB-8, you'll see the video image of your room with the BB-8 displaying a &quot;hologram&quot; (again, a la R2-D2) which transmits the message over and over. Of course, this is of limited practical value as only the image on your screen will show this, not the actual unit, but it still did get oohs and aahs when people saw it.<br /><br />Another feature of the app is an autonomous mode where the BB-8 will roam your hours on its own, much like a Roomba does. It'll plot out its path on the app as it goes; I would have liked to see it perform some kind of mapping function (how cool would it have been to have the BB-8 measure my room instead of me always having to take the tape measure out), but ultimately its &quot;tour&quot; just resulted in a bunch of random lines. To the BB-8's credit, it's pretty good about not banging into walls. To sum up the apps, they're fun as demonstrations but do fall short of anything of much practical use or value.<br /><br />The box claims that the robot has &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; and will &quot;learn&quot; and build a personality as time goes on, but this seemed more like marketing fluff to me. Still, hopefully they're working on additional improvements to the app to enable some cool new features.<br /><br />If I had to sum up, I'd say you'd be best not to think of the BB-8 as a &quot;toy&quot; per se as much as it is a scale model replica of the BB-8 with a glimpse into some very cool technology. Perhaps one day the BB-8 will fetch your slippers or transmit real messages to people in the other room, but for now it's mainly a conversation piece at parties and one of the best movie merchandising products around (appropriate since it was Star Wars and George Lucas who helped movie merchandising take off in the first place).",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AFVIFBQRIO5EV3XIYYHVIBCKSQOA,1448879190000,2,False

I have several collectibles.  This was purchased more to go with my collection and for occasional use than for daily play- so I can't give an honest review of how well it holds up after days of play.<br /><br />I played with this for a couple of hours, much to the delight of my dogs.

He will plow right into them and get stuck.  This is typical of any remote control item, and I'm not surprised or displeased by it.<br /><br />All in all- this is a great toy.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I felt the advertising was a bit off- I did expect this to be a couple of inches bigger just based on the advertising.

349,3.0,Very Cool little Toy but the Cost of Admission is High,"I found this at a retail store and picked it up for $150.  I'm a Star Wars fan obviously but almost not enough to pay what I did for the toy.  It is nicely detailed and fun to play with but $150 is a bit much to ask for what you get.  If the toy was a little smarter or had some sounds of its own I think I would have happily paid what I did but it is somewhat limited on its own.<br /><br />I'm using this with an iPhone 6 and the controls overall work well.  Once you get accustomed to where you are pointing it is pretty easy to drive.  It can be pretty fast on harder floors and workable although slower on some carpets.  The toy does just about nothing on its own.  You can attach it to its charger which by the way looks very nice, and if you press the reset button on the charger, the BB-8 head will move around a bit.  I think since this toy makes a great display piece, it would have been great if they included some things the droid could do while mounted in the charger.  Some noises from the base as well as some specific movements would have been kind of awesome.  It would have really given it some function outside of it just rolling around.  Unfortunately although the base looks cool, it really just charges your BB-8.<br /><br />When you're using the app you have a few options.  You can do a free control where you drive it around as well as get about 8 commands you can trigger for specific movements like a figure 8 patrol.  You have a single joystick for free control which can make things a bit tricky until you get the hang of it.  The right side of the controls are used for your commands or setting the direction.  When using the right side controls a blue light comes on the droid and shows you the back of the droid and the head turns towards the front so you know which direction you'll be going.<br /><br />There is a patrol mode that you can start and your droid will stumble around your room crashing into things repeatedly.  It's not very smart and although it is cool to see it moving on its own, it is just not smart enough to move around in a logical manner.  The final option is message mode which allows you to record a video message with your phone and have the droid project it in augmented reality(looking through your phones camera on the droid) on a nearby wall or just the thin air.  It is a pretty cool little feature that despite its limited usefulness is a welcome addition.  There is also voice control that seems to be able to be used at any point of controlling the droid.  You calibrate your voice and you can tell your droid to follow orders like, &quot;it's a trap,&quot; or &quot;look around,&quot; where your droid will run away or patrol around respectively.<br /><br />The droid itself is very nice and shiny.  The details are nice and it makes a great display piece combined with the base or even without it.  It is made out of plastics but they feel fairly durable for the most part.  I don't think they could take many drops of any at more than a foot without cracking but I have not and won't test that on purpose.  It also doesn't have any sensors to see the edges of tables so it will drive itself off tables. The head holds on pretty nicely and like it has been described, you'll be cleaning the little rollers in the head like the roller ball in the old computer mouse.<br /><br />Its actually a great little toy and if this cost closer to $80 or less, I would happily give this 5 stars but it is much more expensive.  At $150 I would expect a bit more from the toy.  I think not doing more with the base like adding sounds or more features to display the droid nicer was a real missed opportunity.  When you pay that money and realize that it does nothing off the base, you're gonna have to justify the cost with playing with it and currently there is limited functionallity<br /><br />If the price doesn't bother you then take my review as 5 stars because if you're Star Wars fan, you will no doubt enjoy this awesome little droid.  If you're not sure you want to spend that much on this toy and you're not a huge Star Wars fan, then owning it probably won't make you feel like you got your money's worth.  I can recommend this to Star Wars fans that know what they're getting and don't mind the price.  If you're not a huge fan of the franchise and are iffy about spending $150, you should probably wait for discounts or pass this one by.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mFooyprGL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mFooyprGL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mFooyprGL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHXPIB4AX64TCWRRM7RDQLZ33PIA,1444109691000,17,False

353,4.0,I still love toys like this and I was VERY happy for ...,"First, let me say that my family got me this for Christmas since I grew up with the original trilogy back in the '70s. All I can say that even now as a grown up with family, I still love toys like this and I was VERY happy for us to play with it. No, I'm NOT disappointed at all, unlike some other reviews. I would've only dreamed of something like this back in the '70s when toys were mostly all about your imagination. Don't get me wrong, there is room for some improvements, but overall it works just fine and gave us lots of fun. We have not had his &#34;head&#34; to pop off hardly at all, unlike some others. It will come off if you drive it full speed and crash into something, but we don't do that often and take care of what we love. I was not expecting a real &#34;holographic&#34; recording, those don't even exist in real life except with maybe Microsoft &#34;Augmented Reality&#34; and such down the road. This is a toy priced around $150 at the time of this review and while it could be about $50 cheaper, I still think it's fine for what it is. All I can say is we ALL love playing with it, both young and grown ups too. So, if you are like me and have fond memories from the '70s and family or young ones to play with, I would highly recommend this toy.

Also, others have complained that BB-8 doesn't work well on carpets.  We've had no issues with carpets.  We've had it rolling all over the hard woods then from the hard wood directly to the carpet and BB-8 transitions to the carpet with no problem.

First a few things it can't do that the product video makes it seem like it can:<br /><br />-There is no speaker or camera on the droid itself.  It can not make any sounds or hear you.  The actual app on the phone makes noises but nothing comes from the droid.<br /><br />-When the droid is on patrol mode it just randomly rolls around and bumps into things.  It doesn't actual learn the room or do anything more than pick random directions, bump into objects, and then go in other random directions.<br /><br />-The head is consonantly falling off as it collides with objects.  Would be amazing if you could just roll close to your head and it would pop on but you have to stop what you're doing and manually put it back each time.<br /><br />+One positive here is the boost mode is pretty fast and fun.<br /><br />It's a fun little toy but you're not getting a whole lot for this price tag.  A little camera on the droid that you could watch on the app and speakers on the droid would have made this a five star product.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AGELXCSGP547EVKYCPAVJCHOUYIQ,1441387533000,1445,False

407,1.0,"Small Droid, Huge Price Tag!","So far, this droid has been a PITA (pain in the anatomy). I'm completely frustrated. irritated and am left feeling ripped off.<br /><br />Size does matter.<br />The first point to recognize is this is small. No, think smaller. Smaller. The body is about the size of a baseball, maybe slightly smaller. The head is about the size of half a golf ball.<br />Now, when I first saw the box at Target, I knew it would be small. The box was small. What I did not expect, however, is that the droid itself would be about 1/3 the size of the box! With a retail price of $150-180, it's ridiculously small. Horribly small.<br /><br />App enabled.<br />This point worried me. Technology specific items worry me, because I have been burnt with such items in the past. (The &#34;The Batman Interactive Batmobile&#34; comes to mind. It downloaded data from the series. Cool, but, now, useless). But, I heard &#34;This version can do so much more than the Target exclusive&#34;. Yeah? Like what? If you can get the app, it seems like it rolls. That's it. Rolls. Oh, i think (but can't prove) it captures short video and audio clips. Anything else? I wouldn't know, there's no manual. $180 and I have to download a manual? REALLY? So, if I do not return this almost $200 baseball sized annoyance, maybe I will download the manual, and see if it does much of anything else.<br /><br />App, itself.<br />Thank you for not telling us it requires Android 4.4 (I don't have an Iphone, so unsure what version that requires). I use a stupid phone (which I still think is smarter than most dumb smart phones) and I have a Verizon tablet that I use only when necessary (my kindle is my go-to tablet), that tablet has Android 4.2.2. REALLY? They changed the name between 4.2 and 4.4, and nothing under 4.4 works for this?<br />Ok, so I try to update. Nope! WHAT? I can't update to 4.4?<br />Granted, the only way I can cuss out Sphero on this point is, they chose to not write an app for Kindle. They chose to make it for 4.4 and up only. (I'll bet it doesn't work on Marshmallow, 6.0 and up, tho. (Here's where you refer back to my previous point regarding technology specific items). Honestly, i do not know if this is the case, but, would not surprise me. And, if it does still work, I have to wonder at what point it won't. So, for that reason I can and do blame Sphero.<br /><br />Fun<br />The 23 hours I have had this, I have not enjoyed it. I regret having purchased it, at this point.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />So far, I am highly annoyed and frustrated by this entire line of technology. I can almost deal with the size (IF i were able to get it to work). IF it worked, I might be more positive on it. So, for those who have the capability of downloading the app, you will find it more enjoyable than me. However, considering the Target version is much bigger, and typically much smaller, and comes with a remote that will work well into the next millenium (assuming one can still get the required batteries) no way I can currently recommend this product. Instead, I think (without having evaluated it) I would recommend the Target version, at this point.<br /><br />As stated by many others, if things change, so will the review.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AFHVLHAL7UTU3ZZ6GMZCGXUU7TNA,1468455883000,4,True

It can't roll on carpet and has issues with uneven wood floors. And the holograms are only projected on the app. That said, the robot has bumped into doors, walls, animals, and seems pretty resilient.

415,3.0,"great toy, horrible disappointment","The droid itself is adorable.<br />But I have two huge complaints. Apparently the first time he's activated, he shakes and acts adorable. He will never do this again. So a heads up would have been nice. I wanted my kids to see how cute it was, but made the mistake of trying to be a good mom and charge it on Christmas eve. So they didn't get to see a cute droid reaction like I'd hoped. They could have given a tip about this, but this product literally came with zero instructions. Fancy packaging, but no instructions. :(<br />The second huge bummer, I got this for an eight year old. Bought him a tablet so he could control it. Turns out, they dont even have a tablet version of the droid app. So we were all dissapointed because he can't even use his two main presents for what they were intended. The app is so huge that he has to borrow his dad's phone when he gets home from work, because not all phones can even run it. And his dad's phone dies quickly running the app. So we all put forth a ton of effort and money, and after the first week, we were all frustrated and now have a $180 toy that the stars have to align for him to play with, so it literally now has dust on it.<br />It's such a shame. I know plenty of parents did the same thing we did. If you do spend the money on him, make sure you purchase your kid a phone that's compatible too. Really lame that the company didn't put any thought into this.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHGTWMZGS7H5YNFYARP23NULY23Q,1460205367000,0,True
416,5.0,One of the best thought out and executed remote controlled toys produced.,"I bought the Sphero BB-8 for my son for his 5th Birthday.  The timing of the new Star Wars movie relative to his December birthday could not have been better.  I took him to see the movie, and then he received the Sphero BB-8 at the birthday dinner that followed.  His reaction was priceless - and alone was worth the purchase.  But it gets better.<br /><br />This toy is incredibly fun to play with - and my 5-year old son immediately was able to control it with ease.  The interface is that intuitive.  The droid moves and reacts as the movie's BB-8 - because it's essentially just a scaled down version of the original.  The preprogrammed behaviors are a lot of fun for my son as well, and the visual effects using your tablet (iPad Mini 2 in our case) or phone are pretty darn cool!  This toy is incredibly well thought out, engineered and produced.<br />To answer the critique that you need a near 'sterile' environment to operate this toy - that is bunk.  My son's carpeted bedroom is anything but sterile, and while this toy responds more sluggishly on carpet - it still moves around without any major issues.  The only surfaces I would avoid running this on would be concrete, and some types of tile, due to the fact the harder surfaces will degrade the polymer decal on the body of the droid.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of that I would critique about this toy is that it's a lot of fun for adults too.  Thankfully, my son has a relatively early bed time - so I can get some BB-8 time in without frustrating a busy 5-year old.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AF6HA6QV3ZCLQL3MZAOOQXSQINUQ,1462545466000,4,True

Oh and every time it ran into something it lost its head. I ended up returning it for a full refund.

She cannot put it on her kindle, she cannot use my old phone, so she uses my phone on this phone battery hogging toy.  The description online said it works with android and ios systems.  My old phone is only 3 years old and isn't current enough to use with this droid.  The BB-8 itself is kind of disappointing too.  While he's kinda cute and rolls around, the noise doesn't come from him, it comes from the phone.  His movements are not easy to control with the app and he just wanders aimlessly for the most part.  The only cute thing was that the cat thought he was awesome and he would report back &#34;aggressive life form detected&#34; when the cat would bat at him.  My daughter played with him for a whopping 15 minutes before he needed charging again and then she lost interest, did the same thing the next day and then it was left sitting on the charger in the 5 days since.

The app features let you drive around manually, or run pre-programmed movements and emotes, giving the ball a little personality. E.G. You can give a verbal command &#34;It's a trap!&#34; and BB will freak and run away.<br /><br />Don't expect hours of entertainment",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHKGRZ54QZ6CCRYC5U24DCLY7GNA,1462379918000,1,True

474,3.0,"Looks amazing, control is limited.","I think this is an amazing model that looks exactly like what it is: a scaled down version of the amazingly well-made droid BB-8 from the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens movie. However, as an app-controlled robot, it definitely leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />For starters, There are basically only two modes available: first, a simple driving mode that gives you a touch-screen analog stick to move forward, backward, and turn either left or right, with the speed determined by how far you push the stick from the center. Second, you can put BB-8 into patrol mode, which causes him to bump around your room and find the walls and then humorously move through it once he's found all the walls, but you have no control in this mode. There's also a video recording feature in the app to make a video that looks like the Star Wars holograms, but this doesn't really do anything with the toy.<br /><br />I am amazed with how much the paint job on both the body and head look just how BB-8 looks in the movie, and it's really fun to watch his head swivel around in patrol mode and do the little leaning look from the first teaser trailer.<br /><br />The downsides, though, are several. First, the head is somewhat loosely attached to the body via magnets, and while the effect when it's rolling and on top is very cool, it has a tendency to fall off either when picking up BB-8 or when he hits an object at high speed. This is not a huge issue, since you can easily enough reattach the head, but it somewhat ruins the illusion.<br /><br />Much more troubling though is the lack of interaction with BB-8 offered outside of the driving mode and patrol mode options in the app. Perhaps the app will later be updated to allow more options, but right now that's it and it feels very limited when comparing BB-8 to other robots made by Orbotix, specifically the original Sphero that is the namesake of this robot. Sphero SPRK is my favorite due to it being completely transparent and having a great suite of tools that allow anyone from kids to adults to seniors to find interesting and varied ways to interact with the robot. Between simple object oriented programming to full coding options, Sphero allows far more versatile and creative play options than BB-8. There are also a variety of apps that can interact with the Sphero SPRK, allowing you many more interaction than just a simple driving or patrol mode.<br /><br />I would recommend buying BB-8 if you love the way it looks and just want to own a piece of the incredible design that went into Star Wars: The Force Awakens. If you actually want a super fun robot with lots of control and programming options, then I would recommend Sphero SPRK instead.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHOFKYZIM43NLZX3YDPVY3ARYS3Q,1442591861000,4,False

I can see where the robot could start to grow old, since there is currently only so much you can do with it.

When you run it into a wall, it does respond to the &#34;stimuli&#34; from the accelerometer as a feeling of pain. I think this is interesting that it has feelings. I'm an INFJ so this droid set off my extroverted feeling function even and felt bad for it. Sorry to say but that's a sign of the time that robots are getting feelings, usually reserved for us. I'll bet it also feels tired when the battery is low. It is literally a toy and this nerd loves playing with it.

570,4.0,"Cool, but maybe not that cool.","I want to give this a higher score but can't.  When I found out the droid in the teaser was real and not cg I just had to have one.  And I couldn't wait to buy this mini one.  It is very cool and cute.  Though not without some issues.  Some info in the reviews is delivered in a seemingly convenient way.  For instance you can simply use your android or ipad device to control it right?  Well only if you have a new model of either.  So I get mine home and find out it won't work with my ipad nor with my android phone.  I have a friend that says they can update my phone to a firmware or whatever that's compatible.  But at the moment I have a $150.oo paperweight, because you can't even put it on patrol without the app.  To be clear you can charge the thing without the app, that's all.<br /><br />I did get to borrow my nephew's iphone to give it a trial run around the kitchen.  First the bad.  The droid sounds emanate from your device not the droid which diminishes the charm somewhat.  Also the antenna on the head are durable but do seem like they can break from heavy use.  The reason is that when it moves forward they are mostly fine.  But when reversing it can bang them right into whatever may be behind it, a possible oversight in design.  The good: it does pretty much everything else you think.  It rolls around, banging into walls and changing direction to compensate.  It did a little dance or two emoting pride, happiness or frustration I don't know, I didn't get to spend a lot of time with it.  It's awesome how it charges inductively without having to plug the droid in, just the base.<br /><br />It's clear this toy is utterly irresistible.  But This is just one voice that says think a little about it before buying.  Depending on your income $150.oo might be far too much money for the cute novelty it brings.  Maybe wait for the inevitable later models that have improved functionality, and may be bigger.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AEEMODN77LIENJCST5T5PFOIJCGQ,1441442999000,7,False

602,5.0,This is so much fun to play with.,"I'm a Star Wars fan from the first time I saw the movie in 1977, and while the franchise suffered a setback with Jar-Jar Binks, it has been redeemed with this little droid.  Yes, this is more of a novelty item, and there is more that I wish it could do (like really project a holographic message), but the operation of it is really quite easy once you get the hang of it.  I'm using the Samsung Galaxy Tab that I got from Costco, and have had no problems with BB8 not working or responding.  The only thing I hadn't factored in was that BB8 will show how crappy of a housekeeper I am because it picks up all of the dust from areas I haven't reached, and the head's rollers are like the old computer mice, so those have to be cleaned off when the head doesn't move too quickly.<br /><br />OK, Sphero.  Hurry up and work on the holographic image!  I want to be able to have it roll into a co-worker's office to yell at them without having to leave my seat.  :-p",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHT6E777PIXWFHDFUGOXJIHWFMNQ,1446140330000,0,True
603,1.0,The product is so subpar in performance that it turns out to be more of a frustration than helping me enjoy the world of Star Wa,"I to am returning mine.  The product is so subpar in performance that it turns out to be more of a frustration than helping me enjoy the world of Star Wars.  Initially, I was able to get my phone connected over bluetooth and it was a bit fun.  Next time it took me 2 hours of resetting, restarting, in so many combinations that it was frustrating.  It is so inconsistent with its performance that it can only anger you.  I was in contact with support and they gave me multiple suggestions that only partly worked.  Even the &#34;Watch with Me&#34; was so underwhelming that I cannot justify the money I spent on it and am returning it.  Thanks Amazon for  your support of the consumer and allowing us to return bad product.  I even had my nephew over for the weekend and he was so frustrated by the thing that he thanked me for not getting one for him for his birthday.  Don't piss off your family and give this as a gift.<br /><br />Edit additional info.  I worked with their support folks and they finally gave up and said I had a faulty device.  The support guy even suggested that he had the same experience as myself but when getting a new unit all was working.  Well,  I got the new unit today and not only did it not improve, it got worse.  This product has not been QA'ed and does not deserve to be on the market.  I have spent at least 20 hours trying to get this thing to work both the first and second unit.  I so wanted it to work that I gave a number of hours to try.  My expert advice, Stay away from this thing like the plague.  It doesn't work and I went through 2 of them and many hours.

He said that they figured out how to make the head stop moving when it charges because it's 'creepy', a word that his mother and sister also used to describe it.

I thought maybe it was defective as I could easily roll a ball of the same size without resistance across so I exchanged it at the store I bought it at only to have the same problem with the new one. Upon further problems I tried the almighty Google to find out any one else was having this problem then it became easy to see that upon any search of bb8 sphero problems the results were flooded by advertisements and sponsored reviews making it hard for anyone to find out how misleading and false they are advertising this .

The app will connect to BB-8.<br /><br />Once you are connected, you will be taken through a tutorial (don't skip this!)  You have several options: patrol, driving mode, or watch the Force Awakens together. You can also have BB-8 make sounds, nod yes, etc.<br /><br />I am not that great at steering it but I am old.

Slow the speed down when running on smooth surfaces and watch him when he's on a table.  The patrol mode is very cool.  At times when I accidentally get him stuck under my couch, the patrol mode can drive him on out on its own.  The unit is very innovative but you gotta pay attention.

717,5.0,"Really cool toy for star wars fans,  not for small kids though.","This looks and moves just like the real BB-8.  Gave it to my nephew and he loves it.  The built in app has other features like a messaging feature and the BB-8 almost has a mind of its own in the way it moves.  All i can say is the kids love it.  The size is pretty small, looks bigger in the pictures  maybe like the size of  croquet ball lol,  i guess not that many people know the size of of the croquet ball but  it's about 7cm wide but seems wider then that.  What's cool is you set it in it's base and it charges via a usb cable, and it says it will go about an hour on a charge.  The bad thing is if you have very small kids,  the head is on there magnetically so kids can pull it off  and chew off the antenna and swallow it accidentally, so it's not for small kids.  It's controlled by your ipad/iphone or android device.  The app is cool,  you can put a message (record a video) and it shows a scene like it's playing your message like how R2D2 played back holographic messages, except it's just simulating it on the phone or tablet.  You control bb-8 through the phone/ipad as well but it can be controlled by voice as well.

720,1.0,Be sure to check if your device is really compatible,"Sphero jumped the gun on releasing this product as Android compatible; not all Android devices are built alike.  I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab with the 4.4.2 OS and another LG device with 4.4, compatible operating systems according to Sphero.  Got BB-8 out to charge and proceeded to download the app from Google Play and received a message that my device is not compatible.  Sent Sphero support a few tech support messages with only a canned response that they will get back to me.  Today I went to the Sphero tech support site and now see that they have added another requirement for use -- a device equipped with a gyroscope, amongst a few others.  Apparently neither of my devices have this.  Sadly, I just packed BB-8 back up to Return to Sender.<br /><br />From Sphero's website:<br /><br />Android devices, while having OS 4.4.2 or higher, must have all of the following hardware in order to operate with BB-8.

It takes about 10 minutes to get used to learning it's movement habits. Have a pretty open floor otherwise getting it unstuck can be frustrating.<br /><br />Hologram - this is not a real hologram, it's an augmented reality trick.  This means it turns on your phones camera, you look at the BB-8 through the camera and it creates a hologram look in your phone.  See picture for example.<br /><br />Patrol Mode: it moves around on its own making noises, keep app open otherwise it cuts connection and make sure there is room for it to roam.<br /><br />Sounds: the droid itself does not make the sounds, they come through the phone, a little hokey but I don't feel it takes away from the effect.<br /><br />Those are the main points, enjoy and have fun...may the force be with you.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61B96fC+z-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61B96fC+z-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61B96fC+z-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AH3F4LMBNW43Z47GQRQZWGS5QMCA,1450580429000,39,False

But I work in tech, so for $150 I feel he was a bargain.<br /><br />As soon as I saw the video Sphero made I knew I had to have one. I squealed so hard when I put him on his charger the first time and he came to life. I've only had him for a few days, but I love just putting him on patrol when I'm lounging around the house. I find myself talking to him, even scolding him when he decapitates himself on some of my lower furniture. I'm not sure about the 'adaptive' capabilities he has, but if I hold him and make a beeping noise similar to one of his, he'll make the same one back (out of his canned responses)<br /><br />Some people are upset he doesn't work with their device, but it's not like that information is a big secret. Do some research before dropping $150. Yes, his vocals come from your phone and not the droid itself, but to me that's a minor disappointment. This droid is heavy-duty. I have slate floors, I've dropped him from about 4 feet and aside from his head flying off he's good as new. He can roll over cords and rugs, but really hits his stride on hard surfaces.<br /><br />His personality is adorable, and even if he just sat on his charger, shivered and beeped at me I woulda bought him.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AEW4Q5SKDQND4T2HPEM6ZYM7FN2Q,1442110129000,12,False

Also, I would expect my dog to freak out at the presence of a Droid rolling around the house, as it is, she is not friends with an unplugged vacuum, as she is aware of its noise capabilities.

Its a lot of fun, as much fun as a remote controlled car. it's also really fun just to watch, it is so well made that you think that this is the actual design from the movie.<br />What you don't expect is that the app running and connected by Bluetooth is the only way the BB8 stays awake. If you have to use your tablet or smartphone device for anything else the toy goes to sleep. Now the sounds and movements are also generated by the app, so it pretty much rolls around without any noise except for the gyros and motors causing it to move. It would have been even better if there was an actual working sensor in the unit, maybe a camera or even a infrared proximity sensor but nothing even though the app generates info its all just based on collision feedback ... so expect the little guy to run into everything. The controls are a bit of a challenge at first, you have to line up the unit with your mobile device, so that when you push forward the unit goes forward. Unlike an rc car you always know where forward is ... this unit because of its shape and unique movements you really can't tell when it is turned around and controlling it becomes guesswork. Finally the induction charging station is not as fast as regular device chargers, you get an hour of full action but it has to stay on the base for 3 or more hours to fully recharge ... although the unit does manage its power use well, you get an hour run time in total, there is no leaking of power as the unit goes to sleep once not in use.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AE5N2CS6HROT7RPMM7C2RNH7H5SQ,1451300764000,3,True

But what has really turned out to be the best part is how much our dog (mostly) and cats enjoy playing with him on patrol mode. We're currently very busy and don't have as much time to play with the dog, who is a retriever mix and needs stimulation. Ever since we started letting BB8 patrol, our dog has become significantly happier and we are able to keep him entertained without being too involved.

The materials are obviously high end, and no one is going to confuse this as a child's toy.  This is a quality replica, and the design is absolutely collector grade.<br /><br />Sadly, the function doesn't live up the look and feel.  After downloading the app and synching up with the droid, you quickly realize that there are only about 10 or so things that you can actually do with the droid, and that makes for about 15-30 minutes of play time before it's just plain boring.  I guess if I had a pet to chase around the house with it, it may have gotten a little more mileage...but honestly, how long can rolling a ball around the floor really hold your attention?  There are cool internal lights, but no way to activate them on command.  There are eight pre-programmed actions, but you can only see four of them at a time.  And even after you start to get the hang of switching back and forth between the pre-programmed action menus, you have to back out to the direction menu to re-orient the directional controls every five minutes when the droid's sense of true north gets out of whack.  It's really just far more fun to look at than it is to actually play with, and that's just disappointing.<br /><br />Even with all of the functional shortcomings, I was still planning to keep the droid as the ultimate desktop conversation piece...until today.  Today the Sphero folks made it very clear that this toy is not ready for prime time when they sent out two &#34;transmissions&#34; from C-3PO and R2-D2 to highlight the &#34;messaging&#34; feature of the BB-8.  You would think that would add interesting and fun content to the BB-8 &#34;Star Wars&#34; experience, but instead they just spammed my app with two upside down thumbnails that make it look about as professional and believable as Jar Jar Binks.  Not only did they ruin the appearance of my messaging menu, they sent an additional software/firmware update along with the message that doubled the initialization time of the app.  So now it's slower and lamer, with absolutely no added benefit.<br /><br />Obviously concerned, I wrote the company and asked what could be done to correct these issues.  Their response was that there is nothing that could be done to correct the orientation of the images, and that there was no way to undo any update that had been pushed through.  Further, there was no way to disable automatic updates, no way to opt out of these second rate spam messages, and basically no way to take control of the device that I had paid for.  They would maintain control in perpetuity, whether I wanted them to or not.  That means they can strip the app of any function that I may enjoy, force changes to the interface whenever they're feeling &#34;creative&#34;, and basically alter MY droid at will in any way they see fit until it dies.  Now I could understand if this were some sort of networked unit that needed to stay current to interact with all of the other devices on the network, but this is a stand alone toy.  There is absolutely no reason a person shouldn't be allowed to purchase this droid and keep it in its original out-of-the-box configuration, if they so desire.  In fact that's kind of a big deal to Star Wars collectors.  But they couldn't care less.  After all, they already got your money.<br /><br />I guess Steve Jobs would be proud of Sphero's ability to sell a toy and maintain complete control over it forever, but any free thinking individual who grew up on Star Wars toys of the past should be appalled.  I for one will never pay $150+ for a toy that can only be played with at the pleasure of the manufacturer, so I'll be taking my control(and money) back.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ypJYWb0ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ypJYWb0ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ypJYWb0ZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AGGDENI34PHTEBKPGDZ2NH4XKYTQ,1446029341000,310,True

840,2.0,Buyer Beware,"I am a huge Star Wars fan, and put this on a wish list for the family.  My Mother in Law bought it and I excitedly opened it on Christmas.  I wanted this thing to do what it says it will do, I would have been willing for it to be expensive remote control memorabilia at a minimum.<br /><br />I took it out of the box, and loaded the app.  I took it off after charging about 30 minutes to give it a chance.  It immediately started spinning out of control.  Then I loaded it back on the charger and reset it.  Then I took it off and the remote feature worked like it was supposed to for about a minute before it just stopped.  I thought it may need a charge, so I put it on the charger for overnight charging.  The next day I took it off the charger and it worked for 10 seconds.  Then I charged for another 3 hours (according to the manual, it will be fully charged after the light stops blinking and remains solid.  This would always happen in about 2 minutes.)  I took it off and it worked for 10 seconds, repeated this cycle the rest of the day.  Then I started digging for on-line reviews and this was a common problem.  I returned it.<br /><br />Star Wars fan or not, I am insulted that a $150 toy works as poorly as this one.  Some people will buy anything Star Wars and never open the box.  My range of emotion on this was high from excitement to feeling ripped off (That someone else would pay that much for a dud for me).  I could have had a dud, but I did not feel that way when I researched problems and read about the same problems over and over.

He's one of my favourite characters in all the Star Wars movies, so naturally having a mini-BB8 rolling around the office makes me very happy. It's super cute, and I was pretty impressed with how Sphero managed to get his head to move the way it does in the movie, considering we're not quite yet at that level of technology.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />His antenna snapped off pretty much immediately, and he didn't run into anything with that much force.<br /><br />And my biggest disappointment: the sounds ONLY come out of your phone.

901,5.0,This is the Droid you're looking for.,"This is the coolest toy I've ever had, and I'm 33. The folks at Sphero clearly were in a rush to get the product out the door for the movie release, but they've kept their promise to update him, and I expect that they will continue to unlock the immense potential of this little guy in the coming months.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sooooo cute! The little autonomous head movements make him feel alive. He's just full of personality.<br />-Good battery life. I've yet to have him run down on me during a play session (though I don't think I've tried to push the hour mark)<br />-Durable. The body is made of very thick plastic. He's taken some tumbles, and though the head will sometimes fall off in an impact, he doesn't have a scratch on him. He takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'.<br />-Controls are easy to learn and use.<br />-Sphero continues to update the actions and sounds available.<br />-Compatible with other programs like SPRK Lab and Tickle (iPhone only) for infinite programming and customization. This allows you to use BB-8 like a regular Sphero. He's more versatile this way, but not as cute. It's the head movements that really make him special, and older Sphero programs don't account for that added motion.<br />- Voice commands are pretty fun, though there are only a few to choose from.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The current interface is very limited. There are 12 programmed actions, and you can of course drive BB-8 freely. There's no light functions to play with, and Sphero cannot put the program on an open platform because of the Star Wars licensing agreement.<br />- BB-8 runs a bit more sluggish in his specific control program than he does in custom programs like SPRK Lab.<br />- Patrol mode is worthless. BB-8 does not &#34;remember&#34; when he bumps into something, so he just keeps running into the walls and getting stuck in remote corners. Annoying. It would be so much better if he could somehow use distance from your phone or GPS to actually navigate spaces, like a Roomba does. This just may not be possible, but I hope to see better functionality in updates.<br />- Hologram mode does not work that well on my Samsung S5; the image often doesn't line up correctly with the robot, so the image just randomly projects in space. The record function is pretty cool, though. It's just kind of glitchy right now. Hopefully Sphero will update this function.<br />- No &#34;follow me&#34; or &#34;come here&#34; function. This seems like it would be pretty simple to implement. Another function I hope to see in an update.<br />-It would have been SUPER COOL to have a little camera in the head. I know, power issues, it would be too heavy, etc. But I can dream, can't I?<br /><br />Overall, this is a really excellent little piece of technology, but its capabilities are not even close to being fully utilized at the moment. With some added voice and command functionality, and improvement of the patrol mode, I might just never put him down. Well done, Sphero. I look forward to your next updates for my little droid buddy.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AGTFVX5OR3HNWL74IRCSPWAFUUDQ,1451923741000,3,True

903,3.0,"Sphero made a major snafu in lack of app/phone support, but this is a neat toy","Well, as others have written in their reviews, the challenge with the BB-8 is finding a phone that is compatible with the app. I think Sphero really messed this one up by not putting the effort into development of the apps to allow older phones to control BB-8. It's easier to determine which apple devices are compatible with the app, but good luck with android devices.<br /><br />Your child will need access to an iphone 4s or later and hopefully the app will behave. My issue is that it's not unusual for younger children to get older iphone hand-me-downs and thus, the iphone 4 won't work in our case. If you upgrade to the latest iphone every 2 years, then you probably have a 4s, 5, 5s available. But otherwise, you'll need to shell out another $225 to $600 for your little one to have a phone with a gyroscope, accelerometer, and other specs needed. We're looking at an ipad mini as the best path forward. To be sure, I'll plan to go into the Apple store to be certain that it will be compatible with the sphero app.<br /><br />Sphero, you need to consider the demographics of users you have before tossing something out onto the market. Even if you decide to go forward as you have, please be clear and up front about the requirements for the app to control this thing rather than surprising people.<br /><br />I give it three stars though, since the BB-8 itself seems to work fine with my iphone 5s (which I have to frequently give up to my child to use). Yes, the head falls off quite a bit and I agree with many other criticisms I've read. But this is a cool toy that will be in episode 7 when it comes out. Hopefully, BB-8 in the movie maneuvers with a little more grace to survive the attacks I've seen in the trailers, but then again, has a storm trooper ever hit anything?<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />We got an IPod touch, and it works perfectly!

For the rest of us who live in houses that aren't vigorously scrubbed every time we want to use your BB-8, this toy is fairly useless. After just a few minutes of operation it wobbles around because it's picked up so much lint. The smooth ball attracts lint and dog hair like a magnet. It didn't take long for the little wheels in the head to look like the wheels in a non-optical mouse do after a year of operation. What makes it worse is there doesn't appear to be any way to clean them. The little wheels have slits in them that get dog hairs get wrapped around. I can't see there's any way for the manufacturers to fix in future versions other than making it possible to take apart the head to clean it.<br /><br />Two other points that make this toy not the best buy:<br /><br />1. When the battery dies, so does your BB-8. There's no way to replace it because the ball is glued together during the manufacturing process.<br />2.

There are a ton of apps and games for the other Spheros but they don't work with BB-8. If they fix that issue I'll give it 5 stars. BB-8 does a few things that the other Spheros do not, but that's part of the reason you pay a premium over the standard Sphero.

1020,2.0,Update for 2 stars.,"I’m updating this after two years. The BB-8 droid is fantastic...for a year or so. Then it’s garbage. I’ve taken mint condition care of mine, having only used it moderately. For $150 I expect to have a long life out of a device. But, what was awesome is now useless crap. I’ve tried the updates, the resets, and wasted a great deal of time researching how to revive my droid. Time, frankly, Sphero should reimburse me for. It’s a shame such a promising company ultimately fails and disappoints in the end. Fine for large educational institutions that can simply drop More budget on replacements. Crappy when it’s actually a hard working teacher’s money buying the device. Sphero won’t be getting my money in the future.<br /><br />This little droid is truly a new wave of gadget, and the quality and fun of it make it an awesome product. I certainly understand others' frustration with the connectivity issues they seem to be having. However, for me it synched right up and was a blast - up and running after a quick charge. It is actually quite simple to operate and designed with very clear instructional icons and operating features. I expected it to be far more complicated than it was and once I slowed down for two seconds to read what the tutorial was saying it all fell into place. As another reviewer said, if you watch the commercial it is very clear what this toy can and can't do. (Of course it doesn't project holograms from the unit itself; that technology doesn't EXIST yet.) The app is extremely well thought out and smartly designed as a solid partner to the droid, not as a gimmicky after thought. Its ability to respond instantly and mimic BB-8's movements in the movie is excellent and makes it a huge design achievement.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AFG6CW7C6MQLIOPXKLLIQ6MGUEPQ,1451103491000,2,False

1039,5.0,Your cat will love you forever and give you cuddles and you will annoy your facebook friends with Cat+BB-8 photos,"This gets 5/5 ot 9/10.<br /><br />First, the bad. Unfortunately, the unit suffers from some mild &#34;false advertising&#34; from what I can see, the toy does not &#34;learn&#34; from your interactions, in any way that I can reasonably tell. Plus, the advertising would lead you to think it has some time of obstacle detection when really it's just an accelerometer (a hard bump will cause it to flash red and it will emote). Finally, I'm not sure it's a criticism or a requirement of the design (probably the latter, friction = coeff*normal force) but the head's magnet is only strong enough for moderate bumps, so about 1/20 times the head can pop off during operation, but still operates fine. The biggest of all of my complaints: the toy has no speakers of it's own, so any noises it makes are completely driven by the app on your mobile device.<br /><br />Now the good. Have you seen how freaking cute this cat is? LOOK HOW HAPPY THIS DROID-LOVING CAT IS.<br /><br />Yes, I'm an undergrad mechanical engineer, and I wanted the toy for science and all that, but I really truly brought this Primarily because I knew it would be THE ULTIMATE CAT TOY. Rick (the cat) absolutely loves it, he stalks it, he sniffs it, he pounces it - and when he pounces it I count a kill if the head comes off. If you have a cat who loves chasing things YOU MUST BUY THIS TOY.<br /><br />The toy is very good on a range of surfaces, but does best on thin carpet. The rollers on the head will collect lint but thats very easy to clean off. The toy is a lot of fun just to hold and mess with, the gyroscope tries to keep the unit &#34;upright&#34; while it is powered, so you can have fun tossing it up in the air, putting spin on it, etc. - spin it on the kitchen floor like a top, it just keeps going.<br /><br />The app is pretty good, I have not explored all the features, I just use Drive mode and patrol mode. Patrol mode is somewhat OK for enticing the cat but I have found the best tactic for fluffy antagonistic mischief is manual drive - get the droid out of the cats field of vision and he feels inclined to chase after it. At the end of the day, this toy has caused me to create an emotional bond with it, and it is so fantastic that I liken it to the invention of the Ball or Sliced Bread or the advent of Transformer toys. This is one of those once in a generation kind of gadgets, frankly, that will get you excited (or your kids or your cat). If the toy had its own speaker, it would probably be even that much better at amusing the cat!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611JiDshdLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611JiDshdLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/611JiDshdLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710ZKKmAUkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710ZKKmAUkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710ZKKmAUkL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717z1+5JjNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717z1+5JjNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717z1+5JjNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SjDZkV5TL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SjDZkV5TL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SjDZkV5TL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qc-Db5lCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qc-Db5lCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qc-Db5lCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uk1pvA6+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uk1pvA6+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uk1pvA6+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHT73RNNMBFR377JQHREK3IYRTVA,1453441915000,113,True

I am sorry to hear that your BB-8 Battery is no longer holding.<br /><br />Over time, lithium batteries degrade, and it does appear that your battery has reached the end of its life. You can confirm this by charging your robot for three hours, and then removing it from the charging base. If the robot does not turn on, or it flashes long red lights, this indicates your battery is critical. Because the shells are fused together, there is no way to replace or repair the battery.<br /><br />We wish our batteries would last forever - there are two main reasons they are unable to.<br />1. Age - over time all rechargeable batteries lose capacity, and eventually die<br />2. Charging Cycles - in healthy batteries, ions flow between a cathode and an anode. When you charge a battery, ions move from the cathode to the anode. When you're using the battery (playing with your robot), ions move from the anode to the cathode. Over time, this process wears out the cathode, reducing the battery's capacity.<br />Even when batteries are not being used, their lifetime performance degrades. Batteries that are not used can lose 20%-35% each year depending on storage climate and temperature.<br /><br />Since you are outside of our one-year warranty, unfortunately, we are unable to replace the robot.<br /><br />I apologize that I am unable to offer a better solution.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Christophe<br />Sphero Customer Advocate<br />Email | support@sphero.com<br />Support Hours | Monday - Thursday 8am-5pm Mountain Time<br /><br />I have to admit, great Marketing, but a TERRIBLE product.<br /><br />Not buying any more Sphero products will let everybody know that it is not worth it….this is a disposable product, use for a year, and through it out or cut in half and replace the battery ourselves.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AGMH62NB4XGCTJAY6VWAXCSAHC2Q,1609784956457,2,False

For me the real test is how well it can stand up to my dog. I had my dog chase BB8 while i controlled it . It  stood up to the jaws . the bitting. Pretty much my dog tossing it around.

1116,3.0,A cute app controlled droid with limited functions and a hefty price tag,"The Sphero BB-8 is cute and fun to play with for about 10 to 15 minutes, then becomes a very cute shelf sitter.  My husband (a huge Star Wars fan) asked for this for Christmas and ultimately ended up returning him less than a week later.<br /><br />1. We knew going into this that the sounds do not come from BB-8 himself but from your smartphone, but it's annoying to have to carry your phone around with you everywhere when he's just &#34;exploring,&#34; especially since you have to keep the app running and draining your battery.<br /><br />2. The voice commands really don't do much.  My kids kept yelling out the prompts that came with him (only about 10) but yet it still didn't stop BB-8 from rolling down the stairs.  Twice.<br /><br />3. He loses his head.  A lot.  There's nothing like turning around to find a headless BB-8 roaming the house and then having to hunt for his head.  We once found it in the bathroom, then under the dining room table, then in a corner.<br /><br />4. Like other users have said, if you have an older molder Android phone, don't expect to be able to use the app.  My poor husband was so disappointed when he installed the app only to see a message that said his OS was too old to support it.  He had to use my iPhone, which defeats the purpose of him having the droid.<br /><br />5. He's small.  Like, really tiny. It didn't bother us too much, except that he kept rolling under the couch and would get stuck there, or lose his head trying to get out.  Make sure you don't have anything in the way that could trap him.<br /><br />All in all, if you have $150 to blow and don't care about limited functions and average performance, he's really cute and fun to break out during parties.

1161,5.0,You'll have a BALL with BB-8,"I've been reading a number of reviews here about the video being misleading (which I disagree with) and I'd like to add my experience so far, having purchased one on Sept. 4th.<br /><br />No, the sounds do not come from they toy itself, but I find this to be a non-issue. With as much technology that is packed into this little ball-droid, I don't see how speakers for voice could be expected; especially since they would be muffled by the casing. The sounds coming from the app allow for a louder, more clear audio than in-toy speakers could ever achieve.<br /><br />As for controlling BB-8, it does take a bit of practice. I found that it took about fifteen minutes for me to get a good grasp on the controls. Adjusting its speed in the settings was helpful; they key is to not go so fast that you lose control. Patrol mode is fun, and although I've read reviews where people stated that it just bumped into things, I didn't find that to be entirely the case. Yes, within small spaces it will bump into objects frequently (by nature of a roaming mode), but it will adjust itself and continue to roam while preforming quirky personality bits. You can also view a variety feedback data of its journey in real time.As for the head: it stays on very well. The attachment is strong and I've only had it pop off once or twice during play (and only when smacking forcefully into an object). When it does separate, BB-8 glows red and will shake in response. Voice control has a variety of commands including a reaction to the famous phrase &#34;It's a trap!&#34;. It's very fun to see him react to your voice and takes the toy further than a simple R/C robot. Also, during manual control there are a number of pre-set expressions and actions you can make BB-8 do including: 'yes' and 'no' and 'frustrated' expressions, movement in a square or figure-8, wobbling, and more.<br /><br />I feel as if a lot of the negative reviewers expect this to be an earth-shatteringly advanced, real-life robot but if you do the proper research, you'll find that it's a well made, functions very well, and is fun to drive around and have small interactions with. At $150 it's not for a casual buyer (I'm sure other companies will release cheap-o versions), but as a HUGE Star Wars fan, I can tell you it's fast become one of my favorite Star Wars items.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AEG5SV3LKGPNSL3IG4IBDE4HWT2A,1441774333000,171,False
1162,2.0,dont do it,if you are looking for a remote control ball then it is good. However it is not a droid. It does not learn a room on patrol mode it does not have a sensor. I watched a 150 dollar (160 after tax) toy run in to the same wall for 22 mins. I have a 2 story house and this thing without any kind of sensor would kill itself by falling off the stairs on patrol mode. The app makes the noise the droid does not. The head is a useless magnet that actually makes the little dude look drunk as it is traveling. I expected more for 150 dollars so I returned it. It should have a camera on the droid and a sensor so at the least it would not run into the same wall for 22 mins. Piece of crap.

1182,2.0,This robot is half-baked and boring disappointment,"I rarely take the time to write a review. However I shopped around and found what I thought was going to be the perfect gift for my sons birthday. When we received the Sphero BB-8, I was very surprised to see it came without instructions. There are some advertise capabilities on the box, and there are instructions on how to get started. But nothing tells you how to work the robot or what are all of its capabilities. So you have to rely heavily on YouTube videos and the Sphero help page.<br /><br />When I visited the help page I was surprised to see the people representing the company leaving very rude responses to people. This happen more than once per tickly when people were complaining that at the time Voice Commands in the Android software were not supported. One company representative who went as far to call a customer a &#34;SOD&#34; (whatever that means).<br /><br />Anyway with regards to the product I am very disappointed with how it operates. When driving the robot is constantly losing its north south east west orientation. Therefore it becomes very difficult to drive soon after you set the orientation. Secondly the choice of commands for both voice and by choosing icons is very limited, and out right boring. Other then being an RC remote controlled vehicle, this robot doesn't really do anything. I'm greatly disappointed with this product, it's really as if the company was not even trying. Maybe they were just trying to be the deadline and get a product to market before Christmas but I would not recommend buying this it is boring and does nothing of any interest. My five-year-old in my eight-year-old were bored with this thing after about 15 minutes.

My only complaint is the lack of instructions, it doesn't tell you how to properly clean the running gear from the head wheels. I find this important bc the wheels seem Delicate. in addition, the manual just doesn't say anything at all.

For 150 bucks, I would expect it to be a little more durable seeing that the product is capable of potentially wandering into dangerous places.

1241,4.0,"I love BB-8, but I received a defective charging base and had to exchange :(","I love it....but after 3 days of use my charging base quit working, which was a big disappointment. (The reason this gets 4 and not 5 stars) I reached out to the Sphero tech support and heard nothing back, so now I am waiting on my exchange from Amazon. It's a bummer because the BB-8 unit seems to work just fine, it's the base that is defective. I tried someone else's base, as well as placed their BB-8 on my base, so I know for sure it is the charging base that is the problem. When I plug the base in, the lights flash blue once then nothing. I have tried different outlets and wall plugs, all yielding the same results.<br /><br />Aside from the no-charging issue, BB-8 is a lot of fun. I found letting him run around on Patrol mode is the most entertaining. My friends and co-workers all get a kick out of BB-8. I am also really eager to see what additions and updates are created, Sphero advertises that they have a &#34;Big Future&#34; planned for BB-8.<br /><br />Some things to note if you are considering this product:<br />-My BB-8 really struggled on carpet, so if you have only carpeted flooring, this is something to think about.<br />-BB-8 has a knack for finding all the dirt, lint, grime and hair laying around, so to maintain it I would recommend cleaning it's head wheels after every use.

Might be a fun toy, but I never got that far - the Android app requires outrageous permissions and access to your contact list, photos, documents, location services and pretty much everything else on your device. Further, their TOS and (lack of) privacy policy pretty much give them unfettered access to your data and permits them to share it at will with whomever they choose. I'd post snippets of the rights over your personal information that Sphero/Zero grants to themselves, but there's no way to gain access to a version of the documents you can save or print because they've made it impossible to do that from within the app and there's nothing I can find on their website. If it was good policy, they wouldn't have to hide it. That's about as slimy as it gets. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY A TOY LIKE THIS SHOULD REQUIRE SUCH INVASIVE DATA PERMISSIONS! E-mails to &#34;management&#34; at the company have yet to receive a reply. If you're a typical facebook drone who never reads a TOS or privacy policy  agreement before clicking &#34;I ACCEPT&#34; and willingly regurgitates every minor detail of your personal life for others to see and companies to sell to others, you're already in the cesspool and have nothing further to lose - have fun.

The key is to not only download the BB-8 specific app but to download the Sphero Edu app, which allows you to control, program your BB-8 to be way smarter than its pre-programmed self. You can have it react or turn around wherever it bumps into something. You can have your mobile device make BB-8 sounds automatically (or even roar like a Lion) whenever BB-8 starts charging. My 8yo programmed it to run laps around my kitchen island. You can program it to go up to your fish bowl, change colors, and turn around. It's a lot of fun and provides quality STEM-based intro-to-robotics education for my kids.<br /><br />Make sure you have your mobile device Location AND Bluetooth turned on in order for the Sphero Edu to connect to BB-8.

Not a deal breaker, but that's not usually the first thing you want to think when you get a new toy. The size was something of a limiting factor in my not wanting to turn on the mode where he wanders around - you don't want someone stepping on it.<br /><br />The smartphone controls work fine, but the app doesn't add anything of real interest. In retrospect it was anpretty big negative for me because the kids couldn't play with it if I wasn't around (they don't have smart phones).<br /><br />The real nail in the coffin is that it just wasn't much fun. Once you zip him around the room a time or two, the novelty is totally gone.

AND if you do - you will soon find out that the controls - though should appear intuitive they are flawed by the stabilization feature - which continuously makes it wobble to right itself. The head pops off with almost every impact and mind you some of those impacts are not really form you intentionally driving it into something. The thing is just plain frustrating to us.

1476,2.0,A drunk little droid whose battery is no more,"This is a very exciting product idea, but it falls short upon opening the box. Firstly, the ads for this would make you believe the droid itself makes sounds, however, all sounds simply come from the app. The second thing is this droid is more like a drunk little droid, its wobbles all over the place when trying to stop and can barely move on anything but hard floors. Meanwhile the head is gets filled with dust and other wheel clogging items causing the droid to be even less smooth. I will say I am glad you can now purchase replacement heads. Finally, I have had my BB-8 since the first day it was available and now it is completely useless. After not playing with this droid for over a year, I decide to pull it out after some new features were released only to find that it will not hold a charger. I contacted customer support, followed their trouble shooting guide, and when that failed they said sorry its dead and there is nothing I could so now I have a $130 paperweight that twitches in its charger if I plug it in.

1488,4.0,I really like my BB-8 App-Enabled Droid!  Lots of Fun!,"I really like my BB-8 App-Enabled Droid.<br /><br />I was able to play with it right out of the box.  I know that a lot of people are and were expecting a lot more from this Droid.  Okay, the droid would be cooler if it had a camera built in to see from the droids point of view or even better if the droid itself made sounds and noise. So it is not actually a droid as much as a remote controlled ball, and that was all I was really expecting it to be considering the price. The  sound comes as bleeps and bloops from the device you choose to use to control your droid, in my case it is my iPhone 6 plus or my iPad mini 3. There are several cool settings on the app that make the droid do things like move in a figure 8 or a square, give you a short burst in speed, say yes or no and a few other neat things. There is also a cool voice control setting that allows you to make your droid do a few little tricks by talking to it through your device. Lights flash in the droid and the head moves in different directions  when following your commands. The voice control only seems to work well on my iPad and not so well on my iPhone though.<br /><br />The droid itself is about 6 inches tall with its head connected. The head is held on to  the droid body by the use of a magnet and does fall of it you hit a wall or solid object when moving at a high speed but otherwise stays on well.  It is pretty cool that the head stays upright while the rest of the body rolls around and that it turns to face what ever direction the body is moving in. The droid begins to flash red when his head falls of and also beings to make noises through the app. It does not come with any real instructions except for a graphic that uses pictures to tell you to attach the droids head, set it on the charger and download the app. The app will give instructions on how to operate BB-8.<br /><br />Like I said, I really like my BB-8.  The only thing that would be better is if it were more &#34;droid-like.&#34;  It doesn't learn anything or interact with the controller. Other than this, it was a great toy at a great price and anything a really cool collectors item.

My bb8's antena broke off, (I don't know how, he was in patrol  and was missing an antena when I picked him up, but I don't mind, it makes him more &#34;battle damaged&#34;.) they say he maps out his surroundings in patrol mode, but whe just drives, runs into things, backs up and runs into more things.

1511,3.0,It was a lot of fun and my family and I enjoyed it greatly,"I bought this a while back, but returned it after a couple weeks (best buy elite member). It was a lot of fun and my family and I enjoyed it greatly. However, it was difficult for the fun to last more than a few seconds because the head kept popping off. You barely bump something and there goes his head. I spent the majority of the time chasing down his head only to have it knocked off immediately after. And no.. it had nothing to do with my driving the thing.<br /><br />Also, another let down is that &#34;hologram&#34; app on the phone was very clunky and just not that good at all. I tried it out a couple of times and didn't bother with it anymore.<br /><br />Also, the bb8 has no speakers .. the sound comes through your phone. That is stupid.<br /><br />It would have also have been nice if you could see through the eyes of bb8 on the screen of your device.<br /><br />It was a love hate relationship. I loved playing with BB-8, but I also got very angry with having to clean the gunk out from under his wheels (under his head) and picking his itty bitty head off the floor.<br /><br />This BB-8 is very likeable though. I got attached immediately and I know this sounds weird... but he felt like a part of the family, haha.

Somehow this little droid comes across as a real Star Wars droid come to life with how he interacts with everything around him.<br /><br />The app that controls BB-8 is put together well, and it's very easy to use for almost any age.  I do like how the developers have made it so BB-8 can receive future updates to his software.  This means there will be new things added to BB-8 every once in a while to give him new actions, sounds, etc.<br /><br />The fact that I now have BB-8 from the new Star Wars movie in my home is really neat, but the part that makes it great is that it moves and looks almost exactly like how the movie trailers show BB-8.<br /><br />Overall this is a great little droid, and I think that anyone who is a fan of Star Wars, or is just attracted by BB-8's cute looks should buy him.

But instead, the app is on my phone. You can imagine how often I am willing to part with my lifeblood to let her play with him. So poor BB-8, even as cool as he is, spends most of his time just sitting in a corner.

Application.  You have to keep your app on all the time in order to do anything with the toy, and the moment you exit the app or turn off the phone, BB-8 stops, even if it was in patrol mode.<br />2. Sound.  The Sphero BB-8 doesn't make any sound AT ALL, the app is the one making droid noises, and that's just lame<br />3. The head.  The head piece just keeps falling off, however the body will just keep going w/o the head.  So if the head unfortunately fell off at some hidden space, good luck finding it because the body wouldn't be near it.<br /><br />Other than those, it's easy to control the the movement, and its fun for the first 10 minutes after I received it.  I can't really justify the price I paid for it for just 10 minutes of fun so I returned mine.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHOPFZJEURURZZ3URWPJNOVSY47A,1446005189000,8,True

I love the way BB-8's head weaves back and forth depending on how I'm moving it. And seeing the head pointed down at full speed is hilarious. The pre-programmed actions are pretty cool and funny to. Having it react No or Yes is awesome. Seeing it shy away. Giving it voice commands and having it react to that is neat. And I love how Sphero promises to upgrade the firmware to add new features, especially after The Force Awakens premieres since we don't really know what BB-8 does yet.<br /><br />If you can find this little droid, get it! This is definitely a must have and has lasting ability. Especially with the aforementioned future updates. It's hard to get tired of it.

The technology is really neat, the app and all the control features are incredibe, the movements are realistic and it's overall a great concept for a toy that is probably several years away from being viable.<br /><br />The first huge flaw is the size. For the &#34;real BB8,&#34; he's extremely diminuitive. The second big aesthetic flaw is the level of detail on the toy itself. It's literally just cheap looking sticker graphics that look like they would easily come off.<br /><br />Onto the craftsmanship. With BB8's propensity for running into everything, even on patrol mode, they probably should have made him, you know, capable of withstanding those inevitable collissions. O<br /><br />ne of the antennas literally broke off within 15 minutes. They're about a quarter of the thickness of a toothpick, and half the durability. For a $150 toy, you would think the antennas could at least be as sturdy as the black series $20 combo toy that comes with Rey. Speaking of the black series BB8, which would individually be valued at around $10, the level of detail on that figure is easily three times better than this &#34;real&#34; BB8.<br /><br />I get that we're supposed to be paying for the tech, but I just can't see the point if the BB8 itself is going to be so cheaply made. The magnet head is constantly falling off, not secure on the figure at all. It's basically designed to break a lot. We haven't even had ours for an hour yet and we already need to return it.

1649,4.0,He's pretty rad if you know what he is and is not.,"The biggest complaint that people seem to have is that there are no sounds emitted from the droid, all sound effects come from your phone via the app. The video promotion for this droid was arguably misleading. It's a legitimate complaint for people to have, though I was already aware of this prior to purchasing.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I love this little dude. In the spirit of full disclosure, I am a Star Wars guy, so let that be your warning that I may be a tad biased. It controls competently with the app and it moves faster than I had assumed it would be capable of. The novelty of his semi-stationary head is still a marvel of engineering every time I put him on the floor to terrorize the family cat. His free roam mode makes it apparent that there's not much going on in terms of complex spatial logic. But, really, without on board sensors there's really no way for a device like this to avoid obstacles without running into them first. I also really like that, with a push of the demo button, when he's in his charging dock he will glow and move his head around in ways that almost seem intentional, which is adorable. Even though I can get over the fact that he has no on board speakers it would have been awesome if he had a 3 minute timed demo mode while in the charging dock that would periodically emit beeps and chirps while he was looking around (which would require a speaker on the charging dock). I think his little holo message feature (which is all handled in the App in case you were unaware) is such an underwhelming feature that it probably would have been better to not even have it. It is kind of expensive but I've spent more on grown up toys that did less, so to me I don't think his price is an issue.<br /><br />In the end it's a pretty simple decision.

To drive it, you need to calibrate what it sees as &#34;forward&#34; vs &#34;forward&#34; in the app pretty much every time it rolls the length of a room or hits anything. Otherwise, when you move the onscreen joystick it doesn't go in the right direction. The controls are very inexact because it's a ball with wheels inside it that make it accelerate, not move at a constant speed or turn predictably like an RC car. The ball does not make any sounds. The sounds come from your smartphone. Same for voice control - you're speaking into your phone with all the excitement of Siri or Google Now. That really takes you out of the fun fantasy of it being a droid &#34;companion&#34;.

Even though a Kindle Fire does just about anything an average tablet would do, a Fire is not a tablet. We can't use this droid and are happy with our current smartphones but bothers the crap out of me why something like an Android OS is not universal for crap like this droid. Why does everything have to work on our phones and if you don't want to use this on your phone why there isn't another controller for it. I didn't know you needed the fancy Android OS before I bought this; if I knew that I wouldn't have bought this, just went off of the other 5 star reviews I read and videos I saw on Facebook of people playing with this droid.

Having just recently seen The Force Awakens, he's now a Star Wars junkie and BB-8 is one of his favorite Christmas gifts.  He's very much enjoying learning the toy's capabilities and limitations (as his his Dad, I suspect); the mini-droid and its app have a good learning curve for ages 5-12, IMO.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, the price for BB8 is $129, but on 12/19/16, when I purchased it, it was $99.  Not sure what that's about, but obviously I've got no complaint about the price break.  Right time at the right place, I suppose.<br /><br />Since I'm writing this review the day of Carrie Fisher's death, I'll add that it's mighty painful to see her depart the mortal coil.

1720,2.0,Too expensive for what little it does.,"This is way overpriced for what you're actually getting. We purchased this and a sphero for our kids last Christmas. They were about the same price.

You can drive it, but if it hits the wall, there are high odds its head will pop off. You can send it to explore, so it'll wander around your house (again, though, the head falls off so easily, you have to follow it around putting it back on). You can watch/create videos (BB8 calls them holographic messages) on your phone or iPad. You can tell your BB8 to do a few things, assuming you can get the voice recognition to work.<br /><br />That's pretty much it. I don't think we ever found games, nor is there any sort of programming capability. It's very expensive for what you actually get. The sphero is a much better investment for a kid. In fact, my husband &#34;bought&#34; BB8 from our son so he could have his own sphero, because that's how awesome the other robot is.<br /><br />If you're a Star Wars fan with money to burn, and all you really want is a mini BB8 to look at or occasionally wander your house, this robot is probably fine for you.

The packaging is solid (not that that matters to a toddler, but it makes you feel a little better about dropping so much cash on a toy). The droid itself is the real highlight and we weren't disappointed (after we got over the diminutive size). Watching BB-8 explore our house is mesmerizing. It is so much like the movie droid it's uncanny. The app that controls the droid is well thought out and works great, although it has difficulty recognizing my son's voice. I say that's his problem, not Sphero's.<br /><br />Regarding the size. It's small. Like really small. That's everyone's first reaction when they see it. But whatever disappointment there may be with the size quickly disappears when BB-8 starts moving around and beeping and bopping. My son has a bunch of the larger 13&#34; Star Wars figures, so I explained to him that BB-8 is the perfect size for those toys, which it is.<br /><br />In summary, this is an awesome toy. Yes, it's pricey. But if you're a Star Wars Force Awakens fan, or your kids are, you will love this.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHLCD3DOZJAUI2NZDR2GWFBES3FQ,1466439023000,2,True

1767,4.0,"Although it has some noticeable drawbacks, BB-8 is still a totally neat piece of tech.","A great item for any Star Wars fan, or someone who just likes interesting gadgets. It is made well and responds well to commands. I primarily only ever use the drive and autonomous mode. The augmented reality videos are a neat feature but have zero lasting appeal and are not great quality either (the augmented reality features on my 3DS are better). It would have been nice if this model featured some on-board speakers and/camera. I think people would have still gladly paid a higher price for those added features. The build is durable and well crafted, although the head does come off from time to time while rolling. I think this is partially due to the dust and dirt that gets lodged in the wheel mechanic. That is also tricky to clean. I have not seen any of the advertised intelligence or learning traits since I have had it. The lasting appeal is short, at least in this household, but it looks nice and is a good conversation piece. I was hesitant to buy one for months but I had gift money piling up so it seemed time to pull the trigger.<br /><br />Overall, I would still recommend it to any Star Wars or technology fans as I mentioned at the start of the review. It's a really fun piece and half of the excitement for me future potential. As it is app driven it can be updated wirelessly (although that obviously doesn't help the lack of camera or speaker). I think of this as a bit of a prototype and hope they come out with an updated, amazing model some time in the next few years.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AG54LXZGQQBJRIKNK6JQOZVHJPBQ,1459447373000,2,True

Out of all the Christmas gifts, this is the one they have played with the most.<br /><br />Within minutes of seeing this little guy, they had downloaded the software to their iPad 2 minis and were off and running. The daughter was a wiz controlling the unit within 15 minutes having it move in and out of various obstacles; for the son, it took about 2 hours for him to get a good level of control so that he wasn't smashing the unit into walls and other obstacles.<br /><br />They've had no issues controlling the unit even as they switch who controls the unit (just place the iPad near the unit and it will take control); battery life has been plenty long for every session.<br /><br />Only con has been the antennae -- since the device is small it will try to go under a standard couch. While the head can come off, many times the antennae can be bent to a funny angle. There's no functionality with the antennae - it's more of the aesthetic look, so a minor con.<br /><br />If they were under $100 I'd probably have at least two running around the house -- maybe 3 as the dogs seem to enjoy chasing the little droid around as well.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AFKSZ2W6LQ3HX22GJJPEMTIWNVNA,1451319428000,1,True

I sent two seperate emails, which I still have not received a response from either a month later.<br /><br />In fact, I did not receive contact from Sphero until I posted something on their facebook page.  I guess they do not want others to see I am having problems.  Tech support gave me a few things to try, none of which helped.  Then mysteriously tech support disappears again.  I have asked them to contact via phone which I am still awaiting their phone call since they do not have a customer support number of their own apparently.  I fear at this point there is a malfunction of some sort of its internal hardware.

1799,5.0,Wonderful!,"This little guy is great.  Right out of the box he was already raring to go and syncing with my phone!  The messages on the patrol mode event log are hilarious (it marked my ferret as an aggressive life form and my boyfriend got marked with a Stormtrooper mask on the map twice).  A few things:  I see a lot of people are complaining about a few things that really are more their fault.  First it's easy enough to make sure your phone or tablet is compatible with the Sphero before you spend your money, simply look at the website.  It lists the specs your device needs right there.  If nothing else the app won't even show up for you in the play store if it isn't compatible.  You can download the app for free even before you buy so try it, you have nothing to lose.  Second, yeah it's going to catch things off your floor as it rolls around...so clean your floors.  It isn't hard, although with pets I can understand having a bit of a problem. If you're having trouble connecting simply reinstall the app, accept the terms again, turn Bluetooth on and off, and it should be okay.  Besides if you go and purchase something with high expectations you're going to end up disappointed anyway.  It'd a good idea to read reviews on sites like this too.  As for the limited stuff it does now, Sphero has already said they plan on doing more with BB8 in the future so there ya go.  It's called patience.<br /><br />Anyway, the driving is fun, the actions you can command it to do are hilarious...we made a video that had it looking like it was dancing to a Psyclon Nine song.  Haven't tried the hologram messaging yet but I'm not too big into that anyway.  The main draw for me is that it's cute and the fact that it keeps marking my boyfriend as a bad guy is a bonus.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, although for kids I might go with the cheaper Hasbro version, especially if they are the sort to be rough on their toys.

My boys are six and two, they've rolled it all over our house, it's fought my army of chihuahuas quite bravely, it's been dropped a couple times - no problems. Not even a broken antenna.<br /><br />The built-in Sphero app allows you to drive BB-8, ask him simple questions, and send him out on patrol. It's pretty simple, pretty fun, and even my two year old can drive BB-8 - it's that intuitive.<br /><br />Third-party apps make this thing shine. We found an app that allows for drag-and-drop programming and my six year old has fallen in love. He can change BB-8's color to pretty much anything the LED set can handle, make him respond with all kinds of kooky commands, and drive him in increasingly strange shapes and patterns. If for nothing else, getting my kid excited about programming makes BB-8 worth the money and definitely worth a five-star review.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHIMUQA34GMXSO4WOYMFABCRV3DA,1453314720000,3,False

1885,5.0,The BEST Star Wars Force Awakens BB-8 toy on the market for many reasons.,"The box looks special, like you are getting a major collector piece. If you love Star Wars, its a fantastic piece to pick up. The presentation of the BB-8 is probably the best packing I have ever seen for a toy. Opening it up, BB-8 is built and ready to go. The app is fairly quick to download and get going, from open to start it took about 3-4 minutes to get BB-8 to roll around from the package.<br /><br />He is small in comparison to other BB-8 models, but to be honest it works in the favor of being small that he functions better. The technology is great, as its the original technology from the BB-8 in Force Awakens. The functions of the controls through the app require a bit of practice, but after about 10 minutes of rolling around you can easy move him how you want. The app offers a bunch of stuff that I didn't see many others mention. He can do motions at a push of a button that act sort of like a reaction to something. If you hit one he can spin around, quickly move forward, look down, shake his head, and more. Its really gives this BB-8 an attitude.<br /><br />On carpet he moves, not as good as a flat surface. This is something that is expected with any Sphero ball. His head moves great with his body. I didn't have a lot of issues of the top piece falling off. He is very durable and the magnet really holds in place well.<br /><br />Also the battery is great, I didn't play with him until he died. I think getting a hour on a battery is perfectly fine for him. If you want him to patrol maybe that would be different. The patrol is unique,  he really just moves around and bumps into walls and objects, acts as if he looks at it and then moves away. The batteries are no replaceable, but I am sure there will be something in the future just in case a battery needs to be changed out. Sure Sphero will offer a service on that. I would prefer a battery like this over double AA or AAA can get pricey in the long run, in which the Hasbro model has.<br /><br />As for kid functionally, its not as easy has the Hasbro model which is cheaper. However, I think the durable is where the Sphero stands out. If you want to spend 80 dollars on that model, I don't see it lasting as long. You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Last, the sound is fine. I know people want it to come from the actual BB-8, but with the Sphero its sealed. It makes for a better durable BB-8, the sound is just fine coming out of the phone. You could bluetooth the sound to external bluetooth speakers likely that is further away from you. Just a thought on that.<br /><br />I think this is a great toy, probably one of the best Star Wars Force Awakens products out there.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AHLYWJCK2XAJ3P2EGYJSFINXSAVQ,1450990552000,3,False

And The box he comes in is very nice. Not your typical cheap cardboard box. I would recommend keeping it. I can't bring myself to throw it away. I feel like how a product is packaged speaks volumes about the quality of and the care that went into the product. BB-8 himself is very sleek. He is plastic, but not a flimsy type that feels fragile. He appears to be sturdy and well built.<br /><br />He comes with a USB cord, a charging base, and of course BB-8 himself all fit securely inside a styrofoam inlay inside the box to keep BB-8 secure during shipping.  A base to plug the USB into is not included, but I have those things lying around my house in mass quantities so it didn't bother me. However if you wish to plug him in and charge him via a wall socket you will need one so keep that in mind.<br /><br />He is interactive and loads of fun to play with and watch. He's very expressive and animated. He really makes you feel like he is more than a toy. I fell in love with him right off the bat, and so will anyone else I am sure of it.<br /><br />The app is easy to use and has a user friendly interface.<br /><br />BB-8 is reasonably fast and moves effortlessly and flawlessly on hard surfaces and pretty well on carpet depending on how thick your carpet is. I found that he moves better on my area rug than on my actual carpet, but even on the carpet he manages to get around, albeit at a slower pace that takes him a bit more effort, but he does it nonetheless. (I suppose it helps that he is a sphere shaped object) his head rotates smoothly, and he is is very agile. I have read that for some, there are issues with his head popping off, but this has yet to happen to me.<br /><br />He can't do tons of things, but what he can do he does very well.<br /><br />I do wish he made sounds and that they didn't just come from the app itself, so that is a small downside.<br /><br />The holographic video messages are fun, my kids really enjoy recording themselves and watching it play back, and I think it is a cute feature.<br /><br />You might look at this and think it is overpriced, but keep in mind that sphero is a quality brand and Star Wars is a pop culture icon. Combine the two and it can be a bit pricey, but I have seen Star Wars figures, toys and even posters sell for far more than this. Plus you get a fun, interactive experience and a cute new friend to play with. That being said, I definitely feel like it is worth the money and I do not regret my purchase.

1942,5.0,Very neat to a lifetime fan.,"I first saw The Empire Strikes Back on VHS when I was four/five years old ('91/'92). My Grandmother let me pick it out at the local video rental store. I vaguely remeber choosing it based on the cover.<br />I had her rent it two more times over the next year before I realized Star Wars was a Trilogy.<br /><br />I've loved Star Wars ever since. Even in the sixth grade, when I saw The Phantom Mencace, I cringed a bit, but the series endured for me.<br /><br />I grew up on Star Wars. I had/have tons of action figures and vehicles. I made my own movies, as a kid, with friends and action figures, on an old shoulder mounted  Sony VHS recorder camera.<br /><br />If I had this BB-8 back then, I would have been completely enamored. Whether it was action figures, vehicles, light sabers, or video games, Star Wars merchandise always made my Birthday list. I saw this product this morning on IGN and added it to my Birthday list this year (end of this month.) It was extraordinarily nostalgic for me. Star Wars hasn't been on my list in quite a while (28 years old in a couple weeks)<br /><br />To my total surprise, my wonderful Wife brought BB-8 home for me this afternoon. She's adored him since Star Wars Celebration, and she has never seen a single film (just won't budge.)<br /><br />Overall, it's a really neat piece from Star Wars. I'm happy to have BB-8 sitting on my desk. More importantly though, my Wife likes him and my 15 month-old daughter kept saying Beebee [BB] (baby) which, coincidentally is my favorite word she says at the moment, while she was  mezmerized by the fact that its head was turning on its own in its charging station.<br /><br />I Can't wait to play Battlefront on my PS4 and go see The Force Awakens this Winter...very pleased that Abrams is Directing.<br />Thanks for the &#34;droid&#34;, Star Wars, Sphero, Disney, etc. Five-star product, in my opinion.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nh44z54IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nh44z54IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nh44z54IL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AGYA7PKAGKF7BI5BNDAEO4BH5WWQ,1441426676000,13,False

All sounds and video come from free downloadable app NOT from BB-8.  You grant app access to microphone, camera, and speakers on your iPod Touch.  You record video through app and it transforms it into hologram looking 2 dimensional video that you view - as you view BB-8 through the camera on your device - and line up your device with BB-8 to make it look like BB-8 is generating the images.  Some fun preloaded hologram looking video messages from a storm trooper and about the X-wing fighter and C3PO.  Tricky to get the hang of driving BB-8 using your finger on the surface of the iPod Touch.  My daughter took 15-20 minutes to start to get the hang of it - even after an hour still tricky - head of BB-8 only falls off when you run into furniture.  BB-8 doesn't run on the short shag nylon carpet I have.  Runs well on hard flooring.  After a few days of driving I think my daughter will be able to control it better.  BB-8's body does light up - not when driving - when starting messaging mode - when you play video on your iPod.  Head is kept attached to body by magnets.

It doesn't even include a charger that plugs into the wall, just a usb one.<br /><br />Second, it wasn't even compatible with 90% of the phones, ipads, kindles and other devices I had lying around the house, even some of the ones it was supposed to be. My mother's samsung phone was the only thing that would even let me attempt to install the BB-8 app. Why I can't use my PC to control it, I don't know.<br /><br />Third, finally and most importantly it loads your phone up with spyware. I finally get to the google play/app store and the conditions of installing the app to control this thing include access to (I'm copying this verbatim):<br /><br />BB-8 App Enabled Droid needs access to:<br />- Identity<br />- Location<br />- Photos/Media/Files<br />- Camera<br />- Microphone<br />- Wi-fi Connection Information<br /> -Bluetooth Connection Information<br /> -Device ID and call information<br /><br />Yeah, so why does a toy designed for a 10 year old need access to every aspect of my identity, wi-fi, pictures, my phone records? Answer - it doesn't, it just needs bluetooth, the rest is so it can better load your phone up with spyware. DECLINE. Will be returning for a refund. I really don't need more text spam and telemarketers calling me, let alone when someone had the decency to spend $100 or whatever this costs.

I wished it could been bigger, like the size of a basketball.<br /><br />It runs great on carpet and tiled floors, but it lacks the power to go from my kitchen to my living room. The tile is a lil bit lower then the carpet, and that makes all the difference when he follows me into the kitchen and is unable to get out!<br />-update//- the ball portion doesn't work with sphero 2.0 accessories or its apps for that matter.<br /><br />I haven't figured out how to keep him from falling off the coffee table. I am using &#34;explore&#34; and that will hopefully make BB8 learn his surroundings better.<br />-update//- with more time spent on this &#34;droid&#34; I have finally figured out how to keep bb8 from falling off a coffee table. The limits of the so called AI is actually on the app itself.<br />-on the ground, bb8 will learn to avoid obstacles by bumping into them once or twice, &#34;mapping&#34; the obstacles in the app as more time is given to her.<br />-to keep bb8 from falling off a coffee table, you'd have to train it. It won't detect that's there's danger in front of her and not fall off the table. She will always fall off. To stop this, place books or TV remote or dvd cases around the edge of the coffee table. After bb8 has run into them, go ahead and remove the &#34;blockade,&#34; bb8's mapping system will remind her that the edges have obstacles.<br /><br />Because the movie is under wraps and Lucafilm doesn't want spoilers, the droid has limited features.

2022,2.0,"it is a nice ad, and it worked","My wife persuaded the purchase because she was taken by the presentation as seen in a bedbath&beyond store video ad in which they present the bb8 peeking round a corner as if peeking at you.  it is a nice ad, and it worked.  however, the way it is presented is naturally/reasonably interpreted that the device has awareness of that corner and an imperative to peek.  that is misrepresentation of the capabilities of the bb8.  I have yet to see what it learns, as is also promoted, and I checked some of the youtube reviews, post purchase arrggggh, and one extensive review of the disney, hasbro, and sphero bb8's function concur--not sure what this thing learns.  I know this from several hours experimenting, it does not learn where it is and more importantly where it has been.  it will continue to bang into to the same walls. it is essentially a brain-dead ball that moves about with a slick app that creates the illusion of an aware and interactive device. hohum.  that complaint is while on 'patrol.'  that is the reason I gave in to my wife--patrol curiosity.  patrol is a fail; it learns nothing and that is it.  the sounds come from the app, not the bb8.  you can assume some control of the device with 'drive' mode, but that function is not worth $150.  at that price range, I assumed more sophistication and higher age group target.  wrong.  my guess is with practice one can duplicate the peek with drive mode, but of course the reason my wife became smitten is defunct--back in the box.  this thing has a slick app, but the question after messing with it especially after the expectation dashed from the ad-high: what is it worth?  $49, maybe.  Continue to research the device prior to purchase--unlike this dumbbss contributor.  good luck.  I recommend waiting; it will not be too long before we have much more real (not fake) sophistication in these devices.  For those thinking I should have researched and had a better idea and it so unfair to not kissbss, I can argue the ad was my research.  not usually a good idea to base one's research solely on the manufacturer ad, but it is reasonable to assume what is seen is honestly presented.  They give idea this thing can navigate areas like it has awareness, no.  if it goes down a narrow corridor it is either in drive mode or getting lucky.  This thing is NOT worth $149.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AEG5ADVP4WKF2XTPCGX4OYV7RNIA,1456766349000,1,False

2038,4.0,My only gripe with the app so far is that i'd like to see them add new features (I suspect they're ...,"This is the droid you're looking for.<br /><br />What's in the box:<br />BB-8 is packaged in a high quality box reminiscent of Sideshow collectibles packaging in terms of quality. Inside is a tray that holds the droid firmly still (It's unlikely they'll be found with scruffs or damaged antenna new out of the box, as it's packaged very well!). The box is so well done that I would have to say it is intended to be kept. Inside It has a charging base, cable for the base, warranty pamphlet, and BB-8.<br /><br />BB-8 Sphero App<br />The app is similar in appearance and image quality to the new Star Wars app that has recently been put out. It is compatible with I-phones and Androids, so there's no need to worry about that, and it can work on tablets or phones. The app allows you to use augmented reality to play a short holomessage (Help me Obi-wan Kenobi, you're my only hope), remote control BB-8 with your tablet or cell phone, or wander mode, where the droid wanders on its own. There are several options for emoting the droid's action, such as nodding and disagreeing, babbling, and it can also be told to drive in a figure 8 or a square. Personally, I find just letting him wander to be most amusing. Sound comes out of your device speaker, not BB-8, which some may find disappointing. You can also adjust the max speed (and it's quite fast at top speed!). It have read something about voice activated commands, but I haven't seen that feature on my Samsung yet. Either I haven't found it, or it's not available on Android phones yet. My only gripe with the app so far is that i'd like to see them add new features (I suspect they're holding some back to avoid spoiling the movie), and an option to turn off the music. Music isn't too distracting though, as it only plays on the home screen and during start up.<br /><br />Charger<br />The charger has to be plugged into a USB port, but if you have a USB to wall socket adapter you're good to go. If you set him to wander while he's on the base, he'll sit there and mumble at you. He moves around a bit while the app is on, as if he's contemplating his situation or what you're doing. When the app is off, he holds still and 'sleeps'.<br /><br />BB-8 and general use<br />BB-8 itself is quite well done in appearance! The details are crisp, and his scale seems to be close to 1/6th scale. So if you never turned it on and just set it on a shelf with 1/6th scale sideshow star wars figures, he'd fit in quite well (and balances pretty good  for a ball, too). The head is slightly smaller than as depicted in the movie, but it's not all that noticeable.<br /><br />The droid is difficult to control via remote control, or at least, was for me. There's a blue light that shines through the sphere that you use your control to point toward yourself to orient the controls. Even still, so long as you are using it on the ground and not a table, it shouldn't be much of a problem while you're getting used to how it works. I have yet to have the head pop off in use even on wander mode (The droid detects collisions and rights itself when it bumps into something, even on wander mode ... after grumbling). It is rather small though, and at one point got behind my oven (it DID eventually find its own way out ... with a lot of complaints from BB-8). It doesn't see. When on wander mode it simply bumps into something, re-adjusts, and goes in a different direction.<br /><br />It's quite solid, with the ball section of the droid being fairly heavy. The head his extremely light, and has no inner electronics. It seems to be controlled via magnets inside the body. My only worry about the robot over time is the detail on the sphere. I can see the paint eventually wearing with long term use over years. It's smooth as a cue ball with no sculpted detail, but looks great out of the box!<br /><br />I would definitely not consider this a toy for a small kid. It's recommended for ages 8 and up, but it's honestly geared toward older people with disposable income. I could see an 8 to 11 year old screwing it up horribly, which would be ok if it weren't 150 dollars (which to me is a bit of cash).<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />I hope they update the app to disable music, and add pre-programmed movements and more sounds over time ... and want to see the voice activated commands implemented for android phones (assuming it's not just that I didn't find it on mine before writing the review). Outside of that, I'm happy with it. It's like having a small robot cat. ... I found myself talking to it at one point when it bumped into my feet. It really does seem to feel like it's got a personality, which is the big appeal of it. It's worth the price, but there's no need to buy from scalpers until it is out of production.<br /><br />(I've included a picture of mine with a 1/6th sideshow real action hero R2-D2 for size comparison as to my basis as its estimated 1/6th scale).",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AEE4UVW77JPQGF4OBVDOK62Q2EIQ,1441394113000,196,False

It is also dependent upon an app to work, lousy on any carpet except for very short and tight knits or berber and difficult to control on hard floors, makes no sound (all sounds come from the app), and after a few uses gets kind of dull until a visitor comes to your house and wants a demo. The reason I gave it 4 stars has a lot to do with my experience with Sphero. After about 16 months it no longer held a charge. I contacted Sphero expecting nothing and was completely amazed by their customer service. I no longer had the box, proof of purchase, or receipt. It didn't matter. They had me take a photo of it next to my computer screen with google's search screen showing the date and time. The next day I had a prepaid fed ex label in my email to send my dead droid back to them and within 5 days I had a brand new one waiting at my door.

2108,5.0,The perfect gift for any Star Wars fan,"The title says it all, really. This little BB-8 (And I mean little, it stands at just a few inches) is an absolute blast to play with around the house.<br /><br />It has quite a long battery life for its size with relatively quick charging considering it's contacless (Uses a dock that's powered through Micro-USB), and can traverse pretty rough terrain for it's size. With enough momentum, it'll easily get over most things scattered along the floor in the house, over the bumps in pavement and grass.<br /><br />Hair and other kinds of fluff will often get caught in the wheels of BB-8's head, but it's nothing a tweezer can't fix. I've never had a problem with this before, as long as you regularly check to make sure there's no hair clogged up.<br /><br />As BB-8 is connected through a smartphone, there's a whole variety of features to use. The most common and fun one is where you get to drive BB-8 around. There's another where you get to see BB-8 playing a video message through your phone, a 'roaming' mode where BB-8 will just roam about the room and learn where the obstacles are to avoid them (Does not work too well in complicated rooms with lots of obstacles), and even a mode where he'll sit down and watch Star Wars Episode 7 with you, reacting to all the different scenes in the movie. It's even possible to ask BB-8 a question, where he will then either shake or nod his head in response, as well as some audio feedback.<br /><br />Though unfortunately the sound does not come from BB-8, it makes this device no less impressive.<br /><br />If you, or anyone you know is an avid Star Wars fan, this is the perfect gift for them.",[],B0107H5FJ6,B0107H5FJ6,AF723VKSFPZOEXB4NHTFF2A7V2PQ,1466782257000,1,False

Especially because you can record a short clip using your camera and then BB-8 will display it in front of you on your phone screen. The only down side is that I REALLY wish you could post this records of BB-8 to social media because it would be neat to share the videos that way.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good if you ask me. The box advertises 60 minutes and I had it out for about 30-35 or so and I didn't notice any slowing down in movement.
