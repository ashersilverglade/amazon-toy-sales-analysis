0,5.0,A lot of fun for Toddlers,It’s awesome and my grandson (2) loves it.  He has one in his daycare and all the kids play with it so wanted to get him one and he plays with it all the time.  Got the toys to go along with it.  It takes about 3.5 to 4 hrs to put together but is very sturdy and perfect size for toddlers.,[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFTEZMTDJTMY4YIU4HJQEQY35BXQ,1609892936645,0,True
1,5.0,Very nice product for all those future chefs!,"Very nice product! Item was packed very well and all parts were labeled 👍! This was pretty easy to assemble! You just have to lay out all the pieces in numerical sequence as that is the way they go together! There are a some numbers that get skipped, but just review the pictures and you can figure out which ones! The instructions could be much improved with enlarged details on a few of the steps! Especially for the little parts! Another thing to keep in mind is that there are some screws that have a brown finished head and those have particular places they should go! This kitchen has some great features like the ice maker and burners that make realistic sounds! I just wish they would have went a step further and included a working microwave keypad that beeped when you pressed the buttons! But I suppose a red led oven light or a insert for the refrigerator to make it look real would just add to the cost! All in all a very good quality product that I would definitely recommend! It’s well built and fairly sturdy! Total assembly time was about 2 hours, but we (2 of us) took our time! You only need a Phillips screwdriver as the rest is included! It was actually pretty fun to assemble! We didn’t have any missing parts 😉!

21,4.0,Under 3 hours to build.. instructions could be better,"[[VIDEOID:3fbf660096dcb8a1624a8ec21910aada]] Next on kitchen nightmares,,,<br /><br />Kitchen looks great, but installation was a bit tedious. The instructions are ok, but could use major improvements. It took 2 hours 47 min to assemble<br /><br />BEFORE YOU start building remove all battery tabs, before you install kitchen. This step was in the end of the instruction booklet. When it should be the first thing to do.<br /><br />The pieces weren’t too difficult to put together, I used power drill, Allen key, wrench and screw driver.<br /><br />The reason for so many tools was because some angles were tight to fit a drill or a screw driver into. So I needed something short to tighten some of the screws in certain location.<br /><br />Next, the screws were different colors. Some were brown and some were silver. The instructions DO NOT specify what screws to where.<br /><br />So after assembling, it bothered me more than it should to see the screws on the outside being a different color.<br /><br />I then had to swap screws and put the brown ones in all the location where they were visible. It drove me nuts.<br /><br />This oven swings open like a cabinet door, and so does the washer and dryer. Doesn’t really make sense, but it’s a play kitchen.<br /><br />Last, the kitchen curtains tiebacks were made incorrectly. They were sewn on the same side, it looks weird but since it’s for my 7 year old who doesn’t care. It isn’t a deal breaker.<br /><br />In the end, the kitchen looks great. A tad smaller than the photos make it appear.<br /><br />Advice, look at the illustrations very carefully. Make sure you’re putting brown screws with the brown boards to have a uniform look.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the kitchen assembly was moderate with some challenging parts. This is still worth it, because it is a solid kitchen with a couple of fun features.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lZ3WXVO1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lZ3WXVO1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lZ3WXVO1L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFDZME2PAUO2OZELET576CETDB6A,1671025750379,17,True

26,5.0,Prefect kitchen!,"This is the perfect kitchen! I watched the time, it took just under 2.5 hours with 2 adults working on it. Could have taken 2 hour if we both were working on it the whole time together.<br /><br />Adding the lights is a must! I will say, this came in about 500 pieces, which includes all the screws, nuts, pieces and more. The plus side, everything was labeled with numbers or letters. “Put #25 and #32 together with screw B”.<br /><br />Only con was that there are 2 letter “N” screw packets and 2 letter “B” screws packets. At first, I thought they just needed more room in the packet so they made 2 little packets but it wasn’t until half way through when my husband noticed that one of the packets had a brown head (for the outside surfaces) and the other packet were regular silver screws that would be hidden. I wish they were labeled differently or if they wanted to keep the same letter since it was the same size, then mention “brown head” screw. We switched a few of the screw around but ended up leaving a couple of exposed screws the wrong color since it didn’t matter too much.<br /><br />I wish there was a little extra table/counter space, even another attachment would be nice, but we just gave her an extra table on the side.<br /><br />I did put little upgrades around though. I added sop dishes to the inside to make shelves and a command hook basket in the freezer.

27,5.0,Nice looking,"I looked at a lot of kitchens before deciding on this one. I have twins and thought that the size of this one might be better for both to play at the same time.<br />I'm a 37 yr old female and I got this together easily by myself and using just a screwdriver. It took only a couple of hours total. There is a ""what have I done"" moment when you see all the pieces, but if you can spread them out a little to see what you need, it goes pretty quickly. I put it together in a bedroom and moved it into the livingroom and it held together just fine.<br />It is annoying that the screws aren't labeled a little more clearly whether they're to be used on an outside wall (brown) or inside wall (silver). The main thing is to take your time, think it through, and mainly just pay attention. For the most part, once you figure out which are outside panels, it's a no-brainer. If my memory serves me, panels 2 and 25 were the outside main panels. Of course I was going to remember for sure...I'm pretty sure.<br />One thing to consider is the area above the washing machine and the area above the oven are open. We've had several items fall behind which means they're lost in the abyss between this thing and the wall. One of these days I may try to put something blocking things from sliding behind quite so easily. I tried using a broom handle to retrieve the lost items, but they went under the kitchen so that was double annoying.<br />If I had it to do again, I would buy this kitchen again. My kids have really enjoyed playing with this since they got it Christmas. They're two and they can use everything now but will also be able to as they grow. If you have a good corner for this, I would recommend.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A-hKeQ90L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A-hKeQ90L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A-hKeQ90L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AHJDX3QF4FK5G6VTSNE2SBINPO6A,1673234511327,0,False

And it did, It took me about 4 hours. A lot of parts, and some tricky areas with the screws, but TOTALLY worth it! Instructions were very clear, all the pieces and screws marked. Do pay attention though; some of the screws have the brown heads, clearly to go on the outside panels, but I didn't realize that until I had put the thing together... so all the brown screws are in random spots...<br /><br />She came down this morning, and has played with it for 6 hours straight, right up til naptime.<br />It is very sturdy, like a rea piece of furniture.

42,2.0,Edited- falling apart,"Edit: we'd had this play kitchen for only 4 days by the time two handles had broken off. My daughter played with it each day, but not for a particularly long time, and definitely not roughly. She just opened and closed the doors with a regular amount of force, and they've both broken. The screws that hold them in are super crappy. When we were putting it together, we were concerned about how well the handles would stay. Well, they don't stay well. I'm pretty disappointed about it falling apart so quickly.<br /><br />This took almost 3 hours to assemble, even with my husband and a power drill. The instructions were not always super clear, and there were lots of pieces to keep track of. As shown in the 3rd picture, we had a lot of difficulty at this step when we were supposed to attach the screw right next to the stove burners... it was a huge pain trying to find something that could fit in that spot.. screwdriver, drill, drill bit extention, nothing could fit. It was a headache figuring that out.. so the assembly was a pain. However, we expected that, as pretty much all the reviews said it, and my daughter loves it! There are so many cabinets to open. She can't get enough of the ice maker that actually pushes back to make the ice sound (batteries for the ice maker and the two burners are included).

There is plenty of storage, and areas to entertain children. The worst thing about this product is putting it together. Some screws were missing an etched head to place a drill bit into, or they were missing all together. Additionally,  the pre-set holes didn’t match up well causing some cabinetry to be misaligned. Overall, if you’re halfway decent at woodworking, you will figure out how to piece it together given some time.

85,2.0,Toddler kitchen from hell.,"I’m sure I’ll update this review once I have it fully put together and the agony of the assembly process has become a mere memory, but for right now? This thing is EVIL. I must’ve gotten a defective one because almost NONE of my pieces fit flush where they’re supposed to go, unless I turn them around and then those gaudy white screw things are showing and it looks tacky. 1-2 hours my rear end. This is a nightmare.<br /><br />UPDATE: So, yes, the thing is cool. It really is. But it takes FOREVER to assemble and I actually had to flip some pieces backwards because it wouldn’t have been flush, and would’ve made the whole thing tilted up, if I didn’t. That to me is unacceptable. For what this thing costs and for how long it took to put together? No, the dang thing should at least have the parts fit together the way they’re supposed to.

87,4.0,Assembly was long but 6 month later its still a daily staple for all ages!,"Okay. I'm gonna be brutally honest here. I I purchased the retro version of this years ago & it was a hit! Such a hit, that when my kids outgrew it I took it to my work for the kids corner. It's got so much use for years & all the kids loved it. Flash forward until today where I received & put together this updated corner version for the toddler. Upon opening the box I noticed that one of the peices of particle board had been crudly mended. Considering its packed with enough styrofoam to pollute a small village & I had all ready unwrapped it all, I decided to press my luck and hope it wasn't visible. At first the assembly was fun, by pictures only & kinda like tedious adult legos. Then about an hour more of tedious assembly & I was over it. When all was said & assembled, it's very sturdy & has LOTS of nooks of storage space. The factory repaired blemish was not visible. My little one work up for his nap & all of a sudden all of the issues I had were nonexistent. He was UTTERLY STOKED!!! The battery operated burners & ice maker are a fun touch. It's only been a few hours, but I'm hoping that this kitchen will hold up to the same abuse as the last kidkraft I had. I will update in the future. Overall: Assembly is a pain. It really could be worse, but the 65lb box was about 10 inches thick, so not much at all is pretty assembled. Its surprisingly sturdy & even the older kids are having a blast with it. I think the trouble is worth the fun. More so if it were less expensive. UPDATE: Its been about 6 months & this kitchen has held up extremely well for all of tge abuse its taken. Every kid has LOVED playing with it. Hours & hours of pretend fun. Even the older kids have enjoyed it! I purchased a wire basket that fits & holds the produce perfectly in the bottom shelf.

98,5.0,So cute!,"Just like the other reviews, you need to be prepared for the assembly. Don’t wait and leave yourself an hour. This took my husband about 3, and we were working together. One thing I wish I would have known is this could be done in two stages. The first stage is getting handles and clips and such on all the pieces. Then the second is assembling it all.<br /><br />One thing to note: they have great organization for their screws. But, there’s not clarification. Ie: you are shown to use screw “A” - but there’s more than one tray with different amounts. What I realized about half way threw is some screws have brown tops for outside, and silver are for the parts that won’t show. It wasn’t specified, so I have silver screws on the outside. I’m okay with it.<br /><br />Also - you will want a drill. By far, the worst part for us was installing the sink, as hilarious as that sounds, only bc some screws are tight, and you have to literally get under the sink to screw in the faucet from below.<br /><br />I do wish it had lighting like some reviews. That’ll be an easy modification. Overall, HUGE hit!

I picked up a felt pad with 3M sticky side on one side and cut it into strips and then covered all the wood pieces that would rest on the floor  I did this because my brother just had their floors redone and protect them from the wood scratching the floor.  This should protect the floor and as a bonus it made the kitchen less likely to slide on his smoother floor.  Otherwise, putting this on a carpeted floor or placed on a rug is ideal: protects the floor and the kitchen slides much less than on a hard floor.<br /><br />Finally, I like how it came with a spare set of parts that are more likely to break from wear and tear: set of door lock pieces (male and female) and an extra ""clicky"" oven dial.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AG5FZ4N4IWOR6JOETJCAI4HE6FRQ,1609783413862,0,True

111,5.0,Adorable little kitchen,"This play kitchen packs a lot of features into a nicely sized package. Assembly took some time (it ships flat and requires full assembly) but the end result was worth my efforts.<br /><br />What I like most about this kitchen is its corner design. The kitchen can go in a corner, or you can place one of the sides against a wall and have the other stick out. The kitchen is decently sized yet due to its shape doesn't take up a huge amount of space for how much play it offers.<br /><br />There are two windows, a sink, a microwave, a refrigerator, a stove, a dishwasher and a generous amount of space to store dishes and play food on the shelves beneath the sink. You can also store things inside the refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher and stove if you'd like. The windows are a bit silly as they sit against walls in my home but I think I may back them with outdoor prints to make them look more realistic.<br /><br />The stove has two burners that do in fact light up and the ice maker on the refrigerator lights up and makes sound as well. The little phone mounted on the side of the kitchen is a nice touch.<br /><br />My toddler son absolutely adores this kitchen and I expect him to get a good few years of play out of it before he outgrows it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a solid, well built kitchen that's styled more like a real kitchen, look no further.

113,5.0,The perfect kitchen set,"We LOVE this kitchen! Originally I bought a cheaper one and it was not worth it at all.

We were a little overwhelmed upon taking it out of the box and tackling the process of putting it together. It took 3 hours to get it all put together between my husband and I both. The only thing I’d say could be better is the instructions. They were a little misleading but with the help of some YouTube videos of other parents putting it together, we got the job done. This kitchen is sturdy as they get and will hopefully last a lifetime. It has ample storage space and so many ways to play! Another great thing is it’s easy on the eyes. Our apartment is on the small side and this fits perfectly tucked into the corner of our living room and it isn’t an eyesore. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a kitchen set that will last through their little ones childhood and beyond.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71js-h87YNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71js-h87YNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71js-h87YNL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AEGUZOXX5C44WU4ACIJIPJVAKFEA,1581692790542,0,True

143,4.0,Good Price for Value,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for our 2-year-old great-granddaughter. She fell in love and has been playing w/it constantly since she got it. It took around 4 hours to assemble. The instructions DID NOT STATE TO REMOVE THE PLASTIC PROTECTORS FOR THE PREINSTALLED BATTERIES that operate the ice machine & burners; the ones on the burners were difficult to get to and would have been easier to remove before assembling it. It's fairly sturdy even though it's laminated pressed wood. Some things could be made better: the kick-plates are attached w/one screw each side so can move/tip; there's a lot of wasted space in the refrigerator, oven, dishwasher, etc... some extra shelves would be nice. I will try to make some shelf inserts for more storage. The ice machine really sounds like ice cubes dropping when pressed and the burners light-up and make noise when a heavy pot/pan is placed on them. All-in-all it's a good value for the price.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dv8x3JnML._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dv8x3JnML._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dv8x3JnML.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AG5FVSMQMCGJCPEG2JQ25QDAKGBA,1577821463162,0,True

My nephews went bananas when they saw this on Christmas morning.  Great quality, great details, and a far cry from the play kitchens of my youth!  :-)  Putting it together definitely required two people and took several hours.  There were many points during the assembly process where one of us had to hold two pieces together while the other one screwed in the screws.  Make sure you have an electric screw gun/screw driver.  They give you extra hardware, which is great.  Highly recommend this.

Our daughter can barely reach stuff on top of it, which means this will grow with her.<br />+ I love that it has a washing machine, too, and realistic burners with light and sound and ice maker with light and sound, daughter loves them.<br />+ Best playkitchen I could find and a good value for the price (and I spent a month researching them, so many options!)<br /><br />CONS<br />- Batteries for burners/ice maker need to be more accessible! Changing batteries should not involve disassembling a bunch of stuff!!<br />- Batteries could be AA or AAA, rather than the unnecessarily expensive tiny button batteries. Seriously, this isn't a tiny toy, you can hide bigger batteries inside.<br />- Wish burners weren't so sensitive to water/more water resistant, or AT LEAST had an on/off switch hidden inside cabinets to use when water may be involved in play. Of course daughter played cooking with real water and splashed a little on one burner (not much, just a few drops, but there are holes in burners!). Of course the burner no longer works, and to troubleshoot and see if it can be fixed by drying/changing battery involves a dissasembly now (see above). Ugh.<br />- Latches in doors are super tight, our 2 year old barely has strength to open/close them. Wish they were magnetic instead.<br />- Oven door should open up/down instead of left/right but I'm nitpicking. I can see how up/down would pose a risk of injury if done wrong.<br />- Speaking of injury, countertop corners are nicely rounded, but not door corners. Daughter already hit herself in the head.<br />- The phone is kinda pointless, no buttons to press and the holder isn't compatible with the million of play phones my toddler has.<br />- Super duper bonus points if the set was configurable. I would totally pay extra to have the microwave with real buttons and a light and a turning table, washing machine make sounds and sink either fit one of the battery operated sinks available on the market (with real water and pump) or came with that option built in (for extra $$$, of course).<br />- Bonus points if instead of the pointless ""window"" there was a small shelf or cupboard instead, so daughter didn't have to store plates and cups and teapots in the fridge or oven.

My 3 years old daughter and 1 year old son loves it and it is big enough for both of them do do stuff at the same time.<br />Pros: cute color, lots of storage, the fridge makes ice making noise, the stoves makes sounds and lights up. It is a tall kitchen, looks fancy and fits perfectly in a corner.<br />Cons: it took us a while to assemble, my dad and I assembled it in about 6 hours following the manual to the dot. There was a couple of issues with the assembling, some nails are dark and some are silver and the manual doesn’t tell you where to place them, I ended up switching some nails at the end to make it look more aesthetic. One door didn’t have instructions for the hook, so we improvised and did it ourselves. It took us longer because we were watching my 3 year old and 1 year old at the same time. I believe two people uninterrupted can be faster so just keep that in mind; but it was worth it.<br /><br />My next step will be to buy some motion sensor lights when opening and closing the fridge, stove and microwave.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719wczRrU9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719wczRrU9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719wczRrU9L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGJG3DOUFIF5RTEVXYYGMNEMZD5A,1603212079882,12,True

177,4.0,Better than we hoped less than what we expected.,"The packaging of the product was pretty solid. The overall quality of the material what they call Wood is just compressed like fiber with fibers. It's not particle board used for speaker boxes or flooring. And it's not plywood. It's some kind of dance fiber board. Do the piece as a whole they seem strong, however corners and edges are the brittle part because of the thinness and the quality of the material. Don't tighten your screws too tight it will split the wood apart very easily. I used an electric screw gun at the lowest setting my screw gun is so small it probably the size of them the palm of my hand and it was still too strong and split wood when tightening it. So it might be best to use a hand screwdriver. Overall I think my two-year-old might break something on it because it's material. I think plastic might be better to hold up against the abuse of kids. But I can't be too sure we'll see what happens. Do you have confidence and it's durability for the most part. The instructions kind of suck because it's all picture based in the quality of the print job of the instructions suck. Lot of different sizes of screws.

I believe she will get great use out of this for the next several years.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LUgxhurUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LUgxhurUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LUgxhurUL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SvQPWiavL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SvQPWiavL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SvQPWiavL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WI-OhIDaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WI-OhIDaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WI-OhIDaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hWz2aK-dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hWz2aK-dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hWz2aK-dL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AEURPQSQWQZJQQQ7WYLS5DOXLJRQ,1498641243000,13,True

181,5.0,Not as difficult to put together as first expected. Cutest design.,"Wonderful kitchen, possibly better than my own! haha After unpacking all the items it can seem pretty daunting. Lay all the pieces out in order (they are numbered) and check all the components are there. I was convinced it would take 5hours due to many people saying it takes a long time, however my husband got it done in 2.5hrs. He did use a power tool for most of it, which they advice not to do because it could strip the wood. He went slow though and there was no damage. Added some photos, please note the kitchen comes with grey curtains...I just sewed new ones that match our decor better. Your kitchen wont come with the coffee print curtains in the photos.

205,5.0,Quality wood kids' kitchen with great features,"This is our second KidKraft kitchen set and we love it.  The first was similar, only pink/white/yellow, and flat instead of L-shaped.  This one brings an array of new features that we really love -- and, thankfully, so does our daughter!  Here are the highlights:<br /><br />✤ As with our first KidKraft, we absolutely love that it's made of wood instead of plastic.  This gives it a warm and sort of &#34;fancy&#34; appearance in comparison with the hokey plastic ones, and offers similar or slightly better durability.  The paint is high quality and has not rubbed off or stripped away after several years of use on our previous one.<br /><br />✤ On a similar vein, the quality and workmanship is outstanding.  The doors, hinges, knobs, and handles are surprisingly strong.  Our old one, which has been used extremely hard, has yet to have a single piece break.  This new one appears to be of the exact same high quality.<br /><br />✤ The design is really great, too.  It's not perfectly square, but it's square enough to fit nicely in a corner, as advertised.  It has a fridge, oven, washing machine, sink, microwave, and plenty of storage.  You will also enjoy the nice touches of detail, such as the knobs on the appliances, the moving faucet, turning knobs, and curtains.  This is a super attractive kids' kitchen sure to stand out.<br /><br />✤ Assembly was about what I expected.  With the first one, it took probably four hours to assembly, entailing lots of steps, but otherwise it was not particularly complicated or frustrating -- just time consuming.  There are a lot of parts.  So, when you get the compact, heavy box in the mail, just set aside some living room space and have several hours to devote to its assembly.  It's worth it.<br /><br />✤ Finally, as in most of my reviews, a word is in order about the price.  This thing costs a bit more than a lot of kids' kitchens, but it's absolutely worth every penny extra.  When you see it in person, you will know what I mean.

208,3.0,"Great play kitchen, difficult assembly, missing pieces in package","This product got off to a bad start, because it looks like UPS went caber tossing with the package. It was also missing three pieces, the entire hardware kit, and the paper instructions. The instructions are readily available online, and the manufacturer replaced the missing pieces free of charge, so it was an extra headache, but they made it right.<br /><br />Assembly tips: Have two people, one person starts on step 1 (attaching bits to other bits) and the other starts on step 19 (assembly of the item itself). It took us about one nap + 2 episodes of My Little Pony (2 hours) to assemble this. The instructions are not clear that some of the screws have painted or unpainted ends and when to use each type. Put painted screws anywhere that will be visible when the kitchen is completed, or decide that it doesn't matter and just use whichever ones you find first.<br /><br />One of the four hangings pegs broke during assembly, and the faucet is really loose and I fear it may break soon as well. Be careful when assembling those pieces, and do not over tighten. I may try to create my own replacement faucet instead of ordering a replacement from the manufacturer, because a new one will have the same basic design flaws. The hanging pegs are really wide so we don't have anything that can actually hang on them, so I'm not terribly upset about having broken one.<br /><br />This kitchen is the birthday present for my twins second birthday. It is sturdy, looks good, and has room for the both of them to play side by side. They should be able to share it for years to come.<br /><br />It has a lot of storage. We got a huge pile of play food, kitchen tools, and dishes from family for their birthday, and there's still plenty of room for more. Some fabric boxes we already had fit neatly inside the oven and clothes washer, and the girls' 4"" tall nesting mixing bowls set fit on the shelf below the sink. Unlike many other play kitchens I looked at, this one has flat surfaces on the top, meaning we can put additional bins for even more storage up there.<br /><br />It's a bit weird to me that there is a clothes washer in a kitchen, but I guess that's not that unusual! It can also be a dishwasher with a bit of imagination. We put a fabric box inside this to store their aprons and chef hats and oven mitts.<br /><br />This kitchen is 5 stars for a wonderful place to play with lots of storage, minus one star for the fragile plastic parts that break during assembly, and minus another star for shipping packages that are missing pieces.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710QkjdhsWL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710QkjdhsWL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710QkjdhsWL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGZIBDQ3D7BRKY7DVKB76XTWV52A,1565615959516,1,True

232,4.0,Beware the instructions!,"(The following is excerpted from an email to Kids Kraft)<br />First, the good news. The packaging is an engineering marvel. Who ever configured it should get a raise. The quality and fit and finish of the completed unit is also impressive (another engineering marvel). There are a few things, however, that would have helped immensely with the assembly instructions. With all the effort that went into labeling parts for ease of installation, designating where the brown-headed screws should be used would have been nice. I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure that out and still didn’t get them all correctly. A simple ""A/B"" coding would do the trick. The biggest mistake is not instructing us to activate the batteries until AFTER the unit is completely assembled. The ice maker isn’t too bad but the stove top burners are very difficult to access after the fact. Just put the battery activation instructions at the beginning or make a note in steps 9 and 12. I’m sure my grand-kids will enjoy the kitchen and they’ll never know it took four hours to assemble (not the 2 hours and 38 minutes as shown in one of the customer videos)",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFFVOYNZTUV4TGVME7B7ATUGSKXA,1545695207430,1,True

256,4.0,Great kitchen but needs improvement,"We bought this for our daughters for Christmas and it turned out to be a great gift.<br /><br />This kitchen set is made out of wood. It is very sturdy. That's actually the main reason I chose this one.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed that I could notpurchase in white. l had searches high and low for a white wooden kitchen that was all inclusive with laundry but I ended up going good with the brown which was finw. My daughters really didn't complain. Hehe<br /><br />I also chose this kitchen because either is the &#34;lights and sounds version&#34;. That basically means that only few features have lights and sounds. To be exact two. The ice maker makes a very realistic notice and has a light. As does the stove top. R hey have little buttons that causes it to make a gas fireplace noise and light up action. Also the knows on the stove have a clicking action. Which is nice but the laundry only has a picture knob. Which is kind of odd. Also the microwave is just pictures and not actual buttons<br /> I suppose for that price you'd expect the microwave to have buttons and another plastic knob for the laundry.<br /><br />The other thing I don't appreciate is the  plastic features. For a children's kitchen set over $100 I would have appreciated a little more bang for my buck. The handles and knows are very cheap plastic that broke up almost as soon as I overtightenws just a little. I'll be buying some more sturdy ones soon I suspect because this kitchen will last forever.<br /><br />This kitchen set took me, alone, 3 hours to assemble but there's an extra hour because I confused to pieces initially and had to restart. I'd highly recommend planning ahead for some decent help and tools. It'll take about 2 hours to build. On the plus side they anders extra parts just in case.<br /><br />Overall it's a great kitchen but it could use a few improvements for its price.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AE4CGFRJPXSMGH2VDEEGW3GJ2NTQ,1486872138000,14,True

260,4.0,Overall very nice.,"Just got the thing put together. It took all of two hours which i had expected based on other reviews. Everything was straoght forward with simple instructions. The only reason i docked it a star is because the holes for the stove burners were too small and when you tried to put the screws in, they cracked. My fix was drilling them out with a 1/8&#34; drill bit and then they worked fine. Also, the screw bubble packaging had two sets of the letter &#34;I&#34; and the only difference was one set was metallic, the other had brown heads. Not really a problem, im just anal and had to move them around a bit to make things match.

263,5.0,It takes some time but it's worth it,"First of all, assembly goes a lot faster when you don't have a toddler trying to help. The assembly itself takes some time but this thing is STURDY. The instructions were relatively easy to follow as well. My only complaint with the assembly is that there are two sets of ""I"" screws; some are painted to match the exterior and the others are not. The directions don't specify which type of ""I"" screw to use and when, so be mindful of which screws will be exposed when the kitchen is assembled. We knew from other reviews that this would take time to build so we were prepared for it but everything went together easily. All the knobs turn, all the cabinets open, and the burners and ice dispenser light up and make noise so it's very exciting for our kiddo. And since all the cabinets open it's a great place to store all his kitchen toys like pots and pans and food toys as well.

264,5.0,Amazing play kitchen,"Bought this for a one year old and loves it. You do need to buy other supplies for it like pots and pans, fake food, etc. It takes hours to assemble and the instructions are not great. Be careful with using a power drill on some parts. Also, some screws especially I screws come in two varieties - one has brown and other metal on end. The brown ones should be used for the visible part. It is optimal for two people to assemble. Would recommend opening box and placing parts out in numerical order, having power drill and regular Philips screwdriver, it also comes with small wrench. Study the pictures carefully and look at the holes - that is key for how to put it together.<br /><br />Overall despite the assembly, it is a great play kitchen and probably the best out there.

266,3.0,mom of six little ones...very pretty kitchen but has some down sides to it.,"I gave it 3 stars which is hard to do because it is a very pretty kitchen but I had a few issues,  parts broke and doesn't feel sturdy, afraid to move it when we move out of our home into our new home.  Wish it was built better not as strong as our old Little Tikes  wooden kitchen we wanted to upgrade for our younger kids since older kids were hard on our old one I'm not sure if it will last as long (that one lasted 7 years), but as far as looks we like the way this one looks.  We didn't put the clips on the doors so that our children wouldn't have to pull hard on the doors to open them (and they do keep close)...we found with our older  kids kitchen set the doors all fell off because they had to pull so hard on them  to open them and after a while they all fell off.  A couple of pieces were broke but we were able to build around it.  Since it was a Christmas gift we didn't have much options but to continue on, once we were already in middle of building it.  I built this in one day by myself, it took about 4 hours...I had to stop and start because I did it while my kids were doing their schooling (home schooled) but over all not a bad process.  No words on instructions only pictures but it was fine everything was marked but for some screws gave an (I) and they were silver ones and brown ones, some were to be on inside some on outside and they didn't give them a different letter (which they should, that would be an easy thing to add, so that you don't have a silver screw on outside and a brown one on inside.  Looks pretty but not as strong as I had hoped for,  we don't want to move it around to much feels like screws will go right threw the particle board .Glade I got it on sale or else I would have been really sad if I spent over 200, I spent about  139.<br />  On the up side- MY KIDS LOVE IT!

301,3.0,"I love the kitchen, but a few easy fixes by the company would make it great","First, the assembly directions could be more clear on which screws to use. We did not realize that screws that were the same size were still different because some have paint on the end to blend in and others are silver. The directions were not clear when to use which screws since they are labeled the same thing. You would only notice if opened all the screw compartments in the beginning and no one in their right mind would do that. Now we have some silver and some brown screws showing. It is not a big deal, but it is annoying.<br />Second, it would make more sense to have a dishwasher in the kitchen instead of a washing machine. It is also a bad idea for the company. I really wanted to buy the matching separate washer and dryer and have a big play area but why would I want to pay for two washing machines. A washing machine does not really make sense.<br />Third, I wish there was just a little more depth to the kitchen. I love all of the Melissa and Doug play food, but it does not fit. The cookie sheet is too big for the oven and the food sets do not fit in the fridge.<br />And finally, all of the little screws to hold the latches are pointless. The very first time a door was opened and then closed, the latch came right off. We had to remove all of the latches and put super glue on the screws in order to keep them on the doors.<br />It has the potential to be an amazing kitchen. My kid loves it. There are just a few quick fixes that KidKraft could make to make it better.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGQ4HWA3LK57BFOUAJJQCSSHTIRQ,1611856937650,1,True
302,4.0,Great kitchen,"Great ""little"" kitchen for the kids! Just a heads up, there are a LOT of parts stop be prepared up spend some time putting it together. My biggest assembly complaint is that there are screws that have painted heads and the same size screws that don't but they share the same part number.  The instructions don't tell you which one to use where so pay careful attention to whether the screws will be visible or not.  Unfortunately I didn't catch this early enough so I now have mixed head screws exposed.  Also a dishwasher would have been a better fit over the clothes washer, but heck, a two year old doesn't know the difference!",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AH7NXLWLHVOVPAFU52YAW6KERTXQ,1534017391502,0,True
303,5.0,5 hour build time!  Best Christmas present ever!,"This was an amazing and thoughtful gift from Nana to her two year old granddaughter for Christmas.  It is truly amazing and well designed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Decent pictures and instructions.  Except as noted precisely below, we've all dealt with much much worse.<br /><br />Good quality pieces. Precise pilot holes. Everything fit securely and accurately.<br /><br />Heavy. Solid. Will withstand my 2 year old.  And 5 year old, and 6 year old and 8 year old.  All are interested and want to push the buttons and play.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Build time - it took me 5 hours and 20 minutes of nearly uninterrupted work to put this together properly.  There really isn't a way to speed this up.  You must go slow. A drill helps - a little.  But only so much as to tighten once you've used a screwdriver to get the screws started really well.<br /><br />Build pieces - Try not to get discouraged when you are unpacking the box and see pieces labeled 49 or so.  Like I said - it's a slow build.  And the first pieces you need? On the bottom of the box.  Naturally.<br /><br />Confusing Screw descriptions - Okay, you have to be a reasonably comfortable with basic tools and construction builds to even contemplate this project.  But even still....come on Kid Kraft!  Why oh why are you giving two kinds of screws the same identifier even when they are for two different purposes?  What do I mean? Ok....there are two sets of screws labeled ""I"", ""L', and ""N""....because although they are exactly the same kind of screw in size and shape, one has brown coating on it so as to be used on outermost pieces or uppermost pieces.  However, the instructions do not give a distinction when to use the colored top screw and when to use the plain silver top screw.  You have to be sure as you are building and asking yourself - is this an outside ""I' screw or an inside ""I"" screw because on the same piece, you may actually use both. See the picture of the hardware.  This isn't so obvious in the first 20 steps or so as you are building the bottom and back.  I had to unscrew some to conserve them and save them for outermost pieces and replace with silver topped screws.  ANNOYING!  They didn't go through the alphabet.  It would have been nothing to give these painted top screws a different identifier.<br /><br />Build order:  At one point, the build order is flat wrong.  It's an easy fix so long as you do not do it earlier.  I can't remember the exact step, but basically, it's attaching the silver handles to hold hanging pots and ladles.  Don't attach them until the end.  Seriously.  If you attach these 4 silver holders earlier, you will have to take them off to screw in the side pieces at later steps because these prongs severely interfere with the use of any screwdriver or drill.  That wouldn't usually be a problem, except in this case.  These use a screw into the plastic, so to get them tight, and then take them out kind of strips the plastic and it's hard to get them back in securely.  So, save the 4 pot holders for last.  Very last.  It will be okay! Trust me.<br /><br />So yes, it may seem like there are a lot of ""cons"".  But not really.  They are overcome with a little better instructions. The set itself is magnificent for a play set.  I don't regret a single hour building it.  I don't think anyways.  Once it's complete, you really do get a great feeling of satisfaction.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EW9Jq15EL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EW9Jq15EL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EW9Jq15EL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HI2ll3CEL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HI2ll3CEL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HI2ll3CEL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vKaEEfzxL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vKaEEfzxL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vKaEEfzxL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816RYTJ919L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816RYTJ919L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816RYTJ919L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFDWQHYEZT3POXRHUGMJQXALS4FQ,1545611246664,0,False

314,4.0,Great kitchen but has faults.,"Ok. Let's talk this through.<br />1. Assembly: omg assembly sucks. So 3 days before Christmas we decided to get some of the smaller assembly stuff out of the way to save time on Christmas eve. Well I suppose instead of being up until 2am, it saved us 2 hours. We had to unscrew a few things to screw others in place. Putting this thing together is a lot of right spaces and defying gravity. It took us about 5 to 6 hours total. In other words, take the day off from work to assemble. Not kiddding.<br />2.) Sturdiness: it's heavy. It's not moving. Assemble where you want it to live. No way my kid is moving that. My grown adult shelf had trouble at times.<br />3.) Space: there are some small spots. The under sink shelves are about 8 inches deep. The fridge and freezer about 5 inches.<br />4.) Tips and tricks: the backsplash is awfully ugly. Weird painted on plant, soap and utensils. Get $8 faux backsplash contact paper. Looks better. I also used cardboard and extra contact paper behind the stove and duct taped it on the back. If you want to change counter tops, get spray paint. Don't bother with contact paper. It's such a plastic porous surface that 2 different contact papers bubbled and kept coming up. Get 10 mini push lights. 3 for fridge and freezer. 1 over sink. 1 for each shelf under sink, 1 for washer, 2 with bumper tape for the oven. Trust me you need it. The kitchen is super dark spaces. It's a cheap fix and my kid loves it.<br />5.) Biggest irritant: the stove has to be unscrewed from under the oven to replace the batteries. I will never be doing that. It was a serious pain to screw them back in. I had to take one out to screw the side in and putting it back on took 30min.<br /><br />Overall: we/he loves this kitchen. It's great but it's not without it's faults. Plan for double to triple the time to assemble. Don't go too over board customizing it. Get push lights. It's honestly the best kitchen out there though. It really is.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1fHAqly3-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1fHAqly3-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1fHAqly3-L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1prjufzrhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1prjufzrhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1prjufzrhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AEUVMK7HEUDY6E263B3M66HVJJWA,1608923398994,4,True

318,5.0,So happy with this purchase 10/10,"I ordered this kitchen for my kids in October but it was for Christmas so we didn’t put it together till Christmas Eve. I was really nervous about the assembly after reading the reviews but honestly it wasn’t that bad at all, I am glad I didn’t let those reviews deter me from buying it. I did double check to make sure all parts were in the box when it arrived since some people said they received theirs missing parts & since this was a big part of my kids Christmas I felt it was best to check when it got here in case I needed to exchange it. Everything was accounted for including batteries. With that said I did make some customizations per some of the reviews & it really made this kitchen one of a kind. I added magnetic motion sensor puck lights (from Amazon) and put 2 in the refrigerator, one in the microwave & one in the oven so when they open the doors the lights come on. For the motion light in the oven I covered it in red vinyl so when they open the oven door it glows red like it is baking. These lights stay on for about 20-25 second and then shut off on their own. I also added another puck light over the sink that is push activated so they can turn that one on & off as they please. I added 2 silver command hooks on the side so they can hang their aprons on them when they are done “cooking”. I bought 2 bins for the cubbies under the sink from dollar general that fit perfect & were only a dollar each, I also got the plant there. Before assembly I used wallpaper (also purchased on Amazon) to cover the backsplash to give it a more realistic appearance. I planned on using my cricut to put brand names on the appliances like I did the “kitchenaid” mixer however assembly did take some time, maybe 3 hours & I ran out of time, I may add them at a later time. The most difficult part of assembly was there are no words in the instruction booklet at all despite of that it was still fairly to “read” it would have been more helpful if they labeled the screws better since they were all labeled the same I wasn’t sure where the ends were when I started to assemble it so I used the silver screws instead of the painted ones and now I have silver screws showing on the painted sides but that’s ok, I’ll hit them with some paint later. I also didn’t have a legit screwdriver, I put this whole thing together with a Sog multi tool.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase & would definitely recommend this to anyone with little ones. My kids (3 & 1) have been playing with this nonstop since they woke up Christmas morning. I have been joking with my friends and family that I built my dream kitchen, just miniature, lol. I can’t wait to get the matching washer & dryer!<br /><br /> If I had to do this again the only things I would change would be to allow myself a little more time to complete the little customizations I had planned, although I know the kids could care less, lol. I also would have not covered the top of the backsplash so that the inside of the microwave would be white.<br /><br />Just in case anyone is wondering the Melissa and Doug cookie kit pan is too big to fit in the oven, thankfully the kitchen plate set came with a smaller cookie pan so I was able to make it work, also the Melissa and Doug dish rack was too big to fit in the dishwasher.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61E2IPNYPTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61E2IPNYPTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61E2IPNYPTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iIGhEn9KL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iIGhEn9KL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iIGhEn9KL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KZ1MLBJBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KZ1MLBJBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KZ1MLBJBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SKiYslDpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SKiYslDpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SKiYslDpL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZA5WrlLsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZA5WrlLsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZA5WrlLsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ah2tiw8kL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ah2tiw8kL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ah2tiw8kL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dwAEsNnCL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dwAEsNnCL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dwAEsNnCL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8102T6lEtNL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8102T6lEtNL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8102T6lEtNL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8128cthAUyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8128cthAUyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8128cthAUyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lGfx-lQeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lGfx-lQeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81lGfx-lQeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nl4pxr5UL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nl4pxr5UL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nl4pxr5UL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AHTAXKCMZBTIR6IHGJTZKYC4PGIA,1640582990729,0,True

It made it so much easier so we didn't have to go back and forth between us... and on some of the instructions/pictures that made no sense, you can zoom in on the picture to help figure it out. ... Did I mention there are tons of parts? I get why for some things, but others I don't know why it couldn't come preassembled. It took 4 hours+ (2yr old & 6yr old 'helping' included)...

340,4.0,Read instructions and inspect all pieces!,"This review is for the people who like to jump into projects without reading all instructions carefully:<br /><br />I am giving 4 out of 5 stars because some of the wood pieces don't line up easily when ready to be screwed on and in combination with cheap particle board can make for damaged pieces. With that said, KidKraft is awesome about sending replacement pieces if you go to their website and provide proof of purchase. They give you 90 days from date of purchase to do so, no questions asked.<br /><br />Depending on your skill level, you will need to give yourself 2 to 4 hours to put this thing together. There are A LOT of pieces and hardware. One thing I also must add is the hardware comes with some brown colored screws (just the top) to match the wood. The instructions DO NOT mention that. So if you are a perfectionist and want the screws to match the brown wood where they show on the outside, I suggest you set those brown screws to the side and use them accordingly. There are 2 size screws that come in brown, the ones marked &#34;I&#34; for sure. If you don't care about mismatched silver and brown screws showing, then good for you, but it drove me crazy when I noticed 3 of my 4 screws were silver and I had an option to make a truly &#34;clean&#34; look by using the appropriate color screws.<br /><br />I would also like to mention that the battery access to the &#34;stove/burner&#34; is really a dumb placement because you have to take the entire thing off in order to replace the batteries. Unless you want to &#34;crawl&#34; under and unscrew the 3 screws attaching each burner to the wood piece. It's really annoying and isn't mentioned until the VERY END of the instruction manual.<br /><br />This is a great looking kitchen and I'm not going to add to all the photos other reviewers have attached, but make sure you take your time and do it right otherwise you will have to wait for replacement parts like me and undo a lot of work because you didn't use the right hardware or pull the plastic tab that deactivates the battery.<br /><br />Good luck!",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGSAYWODFTUXV2URCHXUYNSHDHXA,1505294474013,17,True

346,5.0,The BEST play kitchen ever!,"This kitchen was the most realistic kitchen on the market, due to the white one being out of stock. We had to settle on the brown kitchen which was still cute. However, being that I’m over the top and i love for my daughter to have girlie things. I customize hers adding pink marble contact paper on the counters. I also added a grayish and white brick for the backsplash. The curtains are really thin and cheap looking (in my opinion) so i purchased some short cheap pink ones. I also wanted to customize her kitchen just for her, so i added her initials in the center. She also LOVES magnets, so i added a magnet board to the side.<br /><br />The kitchen is a great investment, the con is the amount of time it takes to put together.

378,4.0,Perspectives of the husband who had to build it.,"This is one solid kitchen set. Once built, it felt like it would last for a long time. Durable feeling too. That's a great thing because I wouldn't want to spend hours and hours again building this thing.<br /><br />Loved that it was wood instead of plastic but didn't appreciate the gaps in the build instructions that comes with the kitchen set being a furniture (little kids sized) in a box. I would like to pass onto the next person what I learned the harder way. First, the instructions are well done. Follow them. To a fine detail. I did follow them but in my rush to just get it done, I missed small details that I had to go back to fix. Not hard to fix but really annoying having to go back. Second, your experience may vary but my version came with same screws divided into different groups, such as &#34;I&#34; and &#34;L&#34; screws that came in bubble sheets, each having two groups. Shrugged my shoulders and kept building until I realized that one group had screw heads that were color matched to the kitchen and the other were noncolor. If you're not concerned about those details, ignore my second lesson. Third, there are tons of wooden panels and pieces which are each labeled with a number so finding them is just a matter of going through the stack. What wasn't clear is the orientation in which the pieces had to go. Quickest check? Every screw hole should match up and you should be able to get an 1/8 or even 1/4 of an inch of all the screws for that particular direction in every single time. If you see the directions not matching up with what you are doing, it's very likely that you messed up instead of the directions were wrong.<br /><br />KidKraft should just relabel those colored and noncolored screws as totally different screw labels and also include a very prominent direction to be ginger with the screws. That's the last wisdom. For installing any of the plastic pieces, less force is more. Do not overtight.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AHC4F7VNGOBUYWPNRQSY6KZUCU2A,1523197145751,14,True

We did it Christmas Eve and I think it took 3/4 hours with 2/3 people lol.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend. The little moving pieces work and she loves to cook on the burner. She says 'mama burner burner!' she gets everyone ice all the time and she loves to do dishes in the clothes washing machine.

It was worth the 3 1/2 hours to assemble it. I’m a single mom and literally did all of this by myself. My mother did help me with certain pieces that you’ll need an extra hand with, however it was very easy to assemble together. I separated the pieces in groups by their numbers. I found that to be very easy versus laying all the pieces out and searching for the numbers. For example, first group 1-20, second group 20s, third group 30s, and fourth group 40s. This set comes with over 40 pieces so you’ll need a set plan to avoid frustrations and long hours. Also try to use a drill as your tool. But remember to not drill too hard because this is fine wood! Yes even for a children’s play set. They’ll supply you with a wrench but you’re going to need a screwdriver or an electric drill. I find that using a drill was faster vs a screwdriver! All of the pieces are labeled with numbers.

Put on the middle  back panels with the tape facing the back of the unit or you'll have big white strips in the cupboards like me (the kids don't care, though).",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AH4ASFAJHKO4U6XUZA62OAECCHKQ,1578892943467,0,True
419,5.0,Play kitchen I've been looking for,"I purchased this kitchen from another website for a lower price but first saw it on Amazon. My husband just put it together yesterday, so I can't provide an opinion on how it will hold up, but so far I'm very happy with my choice. I got this kitchen for my 16 month old daughter after comparing lots and lots of other play kitchens. Seriously, I probably looked at every wood play kitchen on the market. A bit obsessive, I know, but it's a big purchase and a toy I hope to be enjoyed for many years, so I wanted to pick the one that was just right for us. I'm really glad I took my time because I eventually discovered this kitchen, which came out quite recently I believe (I don't even see it on kidkraft's website), and it meets all the criteria I was looking for in a kitchen.<br /><br />Things I wanted in a play kitchen that this kitchen has:<br />- made out of wood, not plastic<br />- has a refrigerator with 2 doors instead of just 1 (seems more realistic to me)<br />- has counter space for play prepping food/so it doesn't feel so squished<br />- has a washing machine (I know reviews about other kitchens sometimes think it's weird to have a washer in the kitchen, but I like that it's adds variety and I don't have to buy a separate washer machine play set)<br />- neutral color scheme<br /><br />DESIGN:<br />- My daughter still gets a kick out of peekaboo, so the two &#34;windows&#34; are a pretty nice addition.<br />- Although this is a lights and sound kitchen, I didn't buy it particularly for those features. The ice machine's screen lights up and makes sound like, well, an ice machine, which my daughter likes. The lights on the burner are also cute, but it also kind of sounds like an ice machine, which I think is a little weird.<br />- I like that the fridge (top door) has a shelf inside and the oven has a &#34;rack&#34;/shelf because it seems more realistic and provides more storage options.<br />- Also, in general this kitchen, this kitchen has a good amount of storage space, with 2 additional compartments under the sink.<br />- I was worried that the kitchen would take up a lot of space, but was pleasantly surprised at how compact it is. It's kind of an L-shape, but rather than two sides meeting at a point, there are 3 sides, and the area behind the faucet can be flush to the wall. This has been great because we didn't plan to put it in a corner anyway, and we can either put one side against the wall or have the center piece where the faucet is against the wall and still access both windows (because, well, see peekaboo comment above).<br />- I'm also really happy about the height because my petite daughter (about 30&#34; tall) can reach just about everything, although she has to stand on tiptoes to put things in the microwave.<br /><br />NITPICKY CONS:<br />- I really only have 1 right now about the design, and that's that I wish the washer had an actual dial instead of just one painted on.<br />- I'm not sure why, but one burner and the ice machine didn't work right out of the box. After continually pressing the buttons though, my daughter managed to bring them to life.<br /><br />ASSEMBLY:<br />In all fairness, I didn't lift one finger to help assemble this kitchen (someone had to keep my daughter out of the box!). But I think I can accurately say that assembly was pretty easy. Time consuming, yes, there were 90+ steps, but it was probably easier than assembling an ikea bookshelf (sometimes it's really hard to get the doors right on those things!). I think it took my husband about 3 solid hours to put it together, but it seemed pretty straightforward and I didn't hear any complaining from him (I heard a lot of complaining with the aforementioned ikea bookshelves).<br /><br />So overall, I can honestly say I'm really happy with this kitchen, and I can already tell it will provide a lot of entertainment for my daughter.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EvxhRgMgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EvxhRgMgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EvxhRgMgL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LVdk7Nb9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LVdk7Nb9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LVdk7Nb9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OxVQSTw4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OxVQSTw4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OxVQSTw4L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ldrsoXbAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ldrsoXbAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ldrsoXbAL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AHZCCFCNYMR7DPOV4JAN4U2EJMWA,1471837936000,559,False

Only words of warning I have is watch what screws you use where, some of them are painted to match the color of the wood while some are plane screws. In the parts box they are both labeled the same, so take the extra minute to think if it matches or not. Whoever designed this must have kids.

I spray painted the knobs and sink a soft gold. I purchased a peel and stick backsplash from Lowes...also had the same soft gold as the spray paint. It was easy to apply. I had some leftover backsplash, so I added it to the tops of the kitchen as well as on the top of the washer area. I purchased the topiary, wreath and dish towels from Target. Everything turned out better than I imagined. For the final touch, I ordered a chandelier ornament to hang on top of the washing machine area. It arrives next week. My daughter LOVES it so much.

472,3.0,Soooo many parts,"So my daughter loves her kitchen.  I have a few issues with it.  Here's my review.<br /><br />Pros...<br />Looks sleek and nice.  Seems like sturdy wood but we shall see over time how well it holds up. I liked that all the parts were labeled with a sticker so I didn't need to use pictures to try and figure that out.  All holes were drilled correctly and 99% of screws went right in with no issues and lined up perfectly.  All parts were included and they even had a pile of extra misc fasteners included. The stove bubbles and lights up.  The knobs click.  The ice maker lights up and makes sound.  My daughter loves it.<br /><br />Cons...<br />Sooo many parts.  I'm used to putting ikea furniture together and this was WAY  more effort.  There were 49 labeled wood pieces plus the plastic pieces and like 150 screws. The screws were nicely labeled by size in a bubble package ... until I picked it up and they all fell out because the plastic bubbles were cracked.  Also,  some are painted to go on the outside so they  blend in,  but as you build it you need to guess which will be visible.  It doesn't tell you which to use. So annoying.  The directions were fairly clear but no words.  Some pictures took a few minutes to figure out how to orient pieces based on tiny screw holes. My wrist was cramped and killing me when I finished it from all the screws. I don't recommend a power driver but at least get yourself a ratcheting one (which o did use).  I did complete it myself without a helper and it took just over 3 hours. Some of the screws were in hard to reach places so make sure you have a short screw driver on hand to squeeze in tiny places.  There was one on the sink/counter that I just left out because I have no idea how you were supposed to manipulate it to get in the awkward angle.  I  was disappointed that the microwave and phone only have a painted piece.  My daughter wanted to push the buttons after the cool stove and ice maker features and there aren't any.  I thought the sink could make noise or something too. Why is there a washing machine but no dishwasher??","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wxGTfOQTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wxGTfOQTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wxGTfOQTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z5FQllO0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z5FQllO0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71z5FQllO0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFNF3P2EGYASLBIRFVCK5XPE4LQA,1653003930694,2,True

I'm not sure who loves it more, me or her.<br />As far as assembly, it took my husband and I 2.5 hours to put it together. A lot of people say it's tedious, takes a long time. We went into it thinking it would be that way, but was surprised it was rather easy. Set aside time, put the kids and pets in another room, you got this.<br />One thing to keep in mind is that the hardware IS mislabeled. As far as the colored screws are concerned, anyway. If you care about not wanting the screws to stand out on the sides, I suggest pulling out the colored ones and swap them. We didn't mind, so we went along with the instructions and had no other issues.<br />There were a few corners that were damaged (none that can be seen), which didn't mess with the functionality of it, but still annoying. I don't think it was from the delivery, either. The company definitely put damaged pieces in.<br />We decided to put lights in just like one of the other reviewers did.

For the price point, I would expect that it would be sturdy enough that a baby couldn’t easily break it.

Seeing as though it took nearly 4 hours to assemble and it is extremely heavy, I find that to be an unacceptable solution.

545,1.0,Disappointed. Feel like I wasted a lot of money,"Bought this for my 2 year old for Christmas. It was tough to put it together, but my husband and I managed. Some of the plastic pieces are extremely flimsy, and there are screws which are the same size, but some are brown and some are silver (brown are supposed to be used on the outside to blend better), but the instructions don’t tell you when to use which, so for something with this many pieces. It’s not apparent what the outside is until you’re further along and it’s too late, so we’ve got some silver screws where there should be brown and vice versa, but no big deal.<br /><br />The big issue comes in which the quality. For a close to $250 toy, it should definitely be a better quality kitchen. We decided to spend the extra money for a better quality toy as opposed to a cheaper one, but within a month of regular use (toddler use of course, but nothing crazy- she doesn’t hang on the doors or anything like that) the oven door broke off when she was opening it.<br /><br />Really disappointed in this product. I would tell someone not to waste the money.<br /><br />ALSO, the description says the ice maker drops plastic ice cubes. It doesn’t. Doesn’t even have the ability to. It’s completely closed- there’s no way to put plastic ice cubes in it or have some come out. It just makes sounds like ice dropping into a cup. It wasn’t a dealbreaker for me when I realized it during assembly, but it was disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE: another piece broke today. One of the plastic pegs for hanging above the stove broke off leaving a sharp piece of plastic behind. Thankfully I noticed it before my daughter hurt herself on it. Very disappointed, I feel like I wasted a lot of money on this.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NdAXuEmJL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NdAXuEmJL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NdAXuEmJL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B12JwywkIsS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B12JwywkIsS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B12JwywkIsS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1LokhCJiHS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1LokhCJiHS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1LokhCJiHS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1Z6y0np60S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1Z6y0np60S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1Z6y0np60S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFIUCB5LXEIIIKVCVCIHX2ED7ZQA,1612209014239,7,True

It should have more sounds. The cell phone makes no noise , but has buttons . The microwave has buttons , but no sounds. The refrigerator has buttons that don’t do anything too ( only makes noise and lights up when you press on the part where cup goes. )  so the only noise is the refrigerator where you put the cup, and when you set something on the burner.

565,5.0,Awesome kitchen !,Super cute play kitchen!!! First I have to say putting this together was a pain in the butt...it took me about 3hrs. Have to read the instructions carefully and pay attention to some screws that have the top part painted so where the screws show outside the kitchen doesn’t look ugly. I do wish the instructions say where those special screws go exactly. I had to always check and go back to double check I was putting those screws at the right place. But once it’s put together it’s totally worth it. It’s super cute and it looks like a real kitchen. Has some sounds like the stove and ice maker. The backsplash behind the sink I added that myself...I wasn’t to crazy the original background it came with.  I also like that it has tons of room to put accessories. Also bought the matching washer/dryer. My daughter loves this set and has fun playing.,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7151aj1syqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7151aj1syqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7151aj1syqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715dXXCq8OL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715dXXCq8OL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/715dXXCq8OL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BGFBvtpqL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BGFBvtpqL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71BGFBvtpqL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lhs+O-+dL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lhs+O-+dL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Lhs+O-+dL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vkw1j-J1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vkw1j-J1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Vkw1j-J1L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rkeXNw-AL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rkeXNw-AL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rkeXNw-AL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71syLdE6B+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71syLdE6B+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71syLdE6B+L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ub7n715-L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ub7n715-L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ub7n715-L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71urngrXfVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71urngrXfVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71urngrXfVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xE39voWVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xE39voWVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xE39voWVL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFH2IFGGPKBKWKDECOIA7U6GHNTA,1518041107304,1,True

578,3.0,"Cute Set, with sounds to boot!","First off, this thing took a while to put together, with less-than-stellar assembly instructions.  Should you purchase this set, be prepared to spend more than hour to assemble, and have your power screwdriver handy.  It is not difficult to assemble, but there's some common sense decision making that goes into the assembly that isn't explicitly stated in the manual.  For example, this particular set is brown with gray appliances.  There are brown screws that are meant for the exterior, and regular silver screws that will remain hidden.  You need to use your spatial judgment to determine which screws will end up being visible, lest you end up with unsightly silver screws on the very top of your unit.  The set is very cute, and the burners and fridge make noise.  The knobs have that satisfying ratcheting sound when you turn them.  Overall, it is much smaller than I expected for a kitchen set labeled ""ultimate.""  Sure, I could have looked at the measurements in the item description and previewed the size for myself, but I just expected this thing to be bigger.  That being said, it's the perfect size for our one and three year olds.  It doesn't come with accessories (aside from a phone), so do yourself a favor and buy some if you want your kid to be able to play right away.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFO36JKWMXX5T3ANYOL263A7L6SQ,1548683773025,3,True

As we began to search in deeper we found almost all of the pieces were broken in half ( as visible in the picture). I immediately went online and voiced my concern. Unfortunately because it was a Christmas present we weren't able to open the box and set it up earlier and had no time to get another one before Christmas. When we did get the replacement kitchen it was disappointing to say the least. The material is not that great quality. The box of screws is not marked great, there are about 49 I screws and you can't tell there are some with brown tips and some silver ( because the tray is flipped over when you are pulling them out). The two different colors are intended for different parts of the kitchen but nowhere is that explained in the instructions and they are both labeled &#34;I&#34;, no differentiation. The middle section is suppose to fit together into ridges and then it is secured with screws... however as you can see in a photo it isn't cut correctly so. It won't for into the ridges.

648,4.0,It’s a beautiful set once it’s set up,It’s a beautiful set once it’s set up.  DO NOT WAIT UNTIL CHRISTMAS EVE TO PUT TOGETHER. Building it took three days/2 hours each day.  I’m not by any means handy and I am a perfectionist so someone who is more handy might cut that time in half but it’s still a 3-4 hour build. I would suggest maybe hiding it in a spare bedroom or garage while building. Quite a few of the pilot holes that come pre-drilled for you are already stripped so that was annoying.  Thankfully there are sooooooo many screws everywhere else it still holds together very well. The clear plastic film that comes on the door of the washer was cracked out of the box so that stinks but i put clear tape over it to prevent further cracking.

The only complaint I have is that the interior and exterior screws were not labeled so some screws have stained heads and others are stainless steel, well they were mix and match at the end, oh well!  I strongly suggest a flash light to peek down areas and ensure holes are lined up appropriately.  I can't wait for my daughter to see this in the morning.

705,4.0,"Cute kitchen, careful on which ""I"" screws you use for which pieces (painted vs not)","Took me about 2.5 hours for assembly, but I took my time and was careful to line things up perfectly and not overtighten. I added some paper shims behind the stove temp knob as that one was loose compared to the ""on/off"" and the other one.  It would be nice if the ""Fridge"" door had another latch ""c"" piece at the top (there's only one on the bottom) so there is less of a singular pressure point for kid abuse. Definitely be careful with which brown painted screws you use where, we had to keep referencing the finished product to make sure we saw what was what. The main ""countertop"" on ours has a scuff on it that has rubbed off the paint in a thumbnail sized area. Also, the ""Kid Kraft"" stencil under the corner piece is off center, which a kid won't care about, but it just looks sloppy on an otherwise well thought out kitchen. It's also too bad that the phone is just a plastic rectangle and doesn't make any boop noises or ringing. I'll have to see if I can find a replacement that does, they love playing with the phone.

734,5.0,"Assembly is challenging, but it's worth it.","I purchased this kitchen for my granddaughter's sixth birthday. She was thrilled with it, and a lot of the parents at her party were quite impressed. I gave it five stars for the quality and cleverness of the design, but I want to caution prospective buyers about the assembly: it's not easy. The parts are clearly labeled and went together well, but it's a pretty big job that took me a few hours. My biggest complaint is about the hardware. It's in a blister pack, which is helpful, but a few of the screws came in two varieties - with brown heads to blend into the surface and standard heads for less visible applications. Both sets of screws had the same code, and the instructions did not specify which type of screw to use. I ended up making my best guess and swapping out a few later. Another minor complaint is with the &#34;burners&#34; on the stove top. They light up and make a sound when something is set on them, which is a lot of fun. However, changing the batteries promises to be a bit of a pain. Fortunately, my granddaughter's parents will have to worry about that. ;-)",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AHSMCO2FLRBDEHABCPKKLYI2KFHA,1490632607000,0,False

769,4.0,Review and Putting Together Notes,"This will be a Christmas gift for my little guy, so I do not yet know how it holds up but I can share these thoughts and suggestions:<br />1. Do not wait until the night or even the day before to put together, unless you are a night owl and or a master builder. We put it together over a two day period, and it took approximately 4 hours (maybe an hour goes to<br /> un-boxing and organizing and reading through to get a feel of how the instructions will read.<br />2. Instructions -- Awful. Small pictures and it took a lot of concentration and rereading and double checking to make sure what we were doing was correct and we are experienced in this area, I have put together everything from Foosball tables to entertainment systems to bunk beds-- my mom who helped me installed an entire Ikea kitchen in her home. This was not our first time-the instructions are very frustrating at first.<br />Here are the notes:<br />A. Pay attention to the screws -- some are brown tipped, some are not, they do not specify which ones are suppose to go where, they are also not found together in the package. You have brown tipped L's at the bottom, and non-colored L's toward the top. You can always get screw caps to match the wood color if you missed this and did not want to take it all apart to switch the screws.<br />B. The first shelf -- yes the door catch goes on both sides.<br />C. Towards the end -- 46-56 -- pay attention to the Ls and the Is - you will probably be tired and over it by then and it is easy to mix up the two (as a side note, the I screws worked where the L screws were suppose to go (just in those last steps) - I did not go back and unscrew everything to which I just went to hardware store and got new I screws.)<br />D. If you are putting together and need to wait to give the gift, please note that the kitchen is not something that can be put together in sections, moved, then easily set up again. Put together in a place that you can move to the garage or a room and cover with something to hide it until you need it.<br />E. I loved the idea of the motion lights in the fridge, stove, etc. I haven't set up the lights yet, I wish the guy who initially posted the video would have told us what lights he used, but I will figure it out.<br /><br />One last comment: I do not understood why companies who require their products to be put together do not invest in creating instructions that actually instruct us how to put the thing together more effectively.  I am not referring to the time it takes to put something together because all of us have different levels of experience and knowledge in this area. I am referring to the clarity of the instructions itself. Even if the company did not want to provide color copies of instructions, or make the pictures larger which would take more paper. They could totally put an online version of instructions that the customers can access on their computers or phones or print out if they wanted to. Just an idea.<br /><br />The kitchen is very cute and I hope my little one will have lots of fun with it. Hope this helps someone out there :-)",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFIWCS6Q4LCPXRUVRKPUY44HAWIA,1544476570866,4,True

787,5.0,One of the best kids’ kitchens I’ve seen,"***I added LED touch lights. The kitchen does not come with them***<br />I’m the type of person who takes forever to decide whether to buy something. I explore all of my options and read hundreds of reviews. When I was looking for a new play kitchen, this one was at the top of my list because it seemed to have “all the bells and whistles” and seemed to be big enough for my two-year-old and three-year-old to play with together. Obviously, I finally decided to get it.<br /><br />I haven’t given it to my kids yet so I can only speak on the assembly and dimensions, but I am 100% certain that my kiddos will love this due to the size, sound effects (ice dispenser and stove top), and many things to play with. Right now, they have an old Little Tikes plastic kitchen that is much smaller than this and they love it. So what’s not to love about this one??<br /><br />I put it together by myself one night and it took 3.5 hours. The directions are pretty straight-forward and I didn’t find it difficult, but there are a lot of pieces. The number of pieces is why it takes so long. I think it would have been slightly easier with a second person at times when I had to angle myself into weird positions, but my hubby had already gone to bed...he wasn’t nearly as excited about it as I was.<br /><br />I’ve tried to include photos showing the dimensions I had been questioning before I bought it. The oven holds a 7.5” x 11.5” cookie sheet that I got from Ikea. I tried fitting the cookie sheet from the Melissa and Doug wooden slice-and-bake cookie set, but it’s too big. Definitely not a dealbreaker by any means. Overall, the kitchen feels pretty sturdy and well-made.<br /><br />I love this kitchen and I can’t wait to stock it with food and see my kiddos play with it. I’ve never been disappointed with any Kidkraft product and this is no exception. Next on my wishlist is a playhouse!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+6nCVkCvL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+6nCVkCvL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+6nCVkCvL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HLGnL16gL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HLGnL16gL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HLGnL16gL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OpqBN+S1L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OpqBN+S1L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OpqBN+S1L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UFSsC0O2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UFSsC0O2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UFSsC0O2L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WmVKGvY0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WmVKGvY0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WmVKGvY0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c-4vAd7ZL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c-4vAd7ZL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71c-4vAd7ZL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fNyXcE3bL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fNyXcE3bL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fNyXcE3bL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nI7QoNOKL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nI7QoNOKL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nI7QoNOKL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SqX34IYpL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SqX34IYpL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SqX34IYpL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AEERYC227R6L3RHY3RVNEOS7JYZQ,1522867790130,9,False

It’s nice that it’s a corner unit, so you get more bang for your buck. Since I bought it for my boys, I liked that it looked like a real-life kitchen and it actually matches our real kitchen. Anytime other kids come to play, they are immediately drawn to the kitchen. When they outgrow this in a couple of years, we will donate it and I know the next family will love it just as much.

789,4.0,"Pretty good, but is flawed.","1st! We do really like the kitchen. We have two littles under three so we saw it as something that would  get a lot of use. The instructions are an issue as mentioned in the reviews but if you know that, you know how to fix it when you get them. Took about 90 minutes for my husband to build.<br /><br />The flaw is in the plastic pieces. It was in the first week that one of the hooks above the stove completely snapped off revealing a screw underneath. I mentioned it to my husband and he said he wasn't surprised because he saw it being a problem when he put it together. We had to superglue it back on but now we don't want our kids playing with it unattended. Which, honestly would be kind of nice occasionally.<br /><br />Its got lots of storage space and is tall, which is what drew me to it the most. I was thinking of long term use.<br />Both my 1 year old and 3 year old are fascinated with the different features. Overall its good (I'm only a month in.) But its not going to hold up as well as an ALL WOOD one would, but the all wood ones wouldn't have these features.<br />Edit to add**** one year later and the microwave stopper broke off(not a big deal though) and the faucet did fall apart like other reviewers mentioned.<br />Hopefully the company can fix these since Many have reported the same problems.<br />2023 update:<br />All the things mentioned above are still the case. We removed the facet and the microwave stopper is not attached (not a big deal for that one)<br />The small hangers that broke off first, we superglue and they have not broken since.<br />It's still one of our favorite big ticket items to date for our toddlers.

(I recommend the Melissa and Doug sliceable fruits and veggies - they even make a slicing sound when cutting through the Velcro that holds the pieces together).<br /><br />Cons:  I wish the microwave and washing machine panels were also somewhat interactive rather than being just painted on.  Also wish the oven opened downwards like a real oven.  My daughter picked up on that difference right away and was skeptical that it was an oven!  Lastly, note that the phone is essentially a throw-away - just a plastic rectangle with a keypad sticker stuck on - but we just replaced it with one of her more interactive toy phones.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFHYAEELJPHPOQH3QVPKVQEIBZQA,1473259721000,14,True

It is very time consuming and quite boring to do by yourself.<br />2) Do it alone if the only company you have is your child. Having a child nagging non stop while you try to build this thing prolongs the process by at least 3 hours and sends you at least 2 states closer to being committed into a mental institution.<br />Note: The above statement is not a joke.<br />3) Does not come with the utensils and pretend foods so I suggest the Melissa and Doug stainless steel set which perfectly compliments this modern kitchen and the 'cutting foods',[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AEOYTDWK3MTZKIZNWJGSDAOM567Q,1493135136000,0,False

The icemaker makes a realistic sound, the stove lights up, stove knobs click, water faucet turns and all the doors open/ close.  She also likes the phone that is included (although I'd say it's the only thing that could be improved since it's very cheap looking) and loves playing hide/seek through the window curtains.  The battery operated features do not offer an on /off switch, but if you need to turn them off you can always take off the batteries.<br /><br />Mom: Loves that the colors are unisex, its great to fit in a corner to maximize space, has a lot of storage space and looks very modern.<br />However, this is a very time consuming toy to assemble.  Just to give you an idea it took my husband a little over two hours to finish the kitchen. It's not difficult as all the steps are illustrated, but its a 20 page instruction manual with over 80 steps. The only recommended tool is an electric screwdriver. Everything else is included.<br /><br />Once finished it's exactly as pictured. You won't be dissappointed. I've attached pictures so that you can see by yourself.<br />----<br />I also recommed buying the Kidkraft cookware set and the Learning Resources New Sprouts Market set. With those two items you are all set for long hours of play!!! I also bought the Melissa and Doug cookware set, but had to return them since my daughter was slamming the metal pots against the kitchen and I was afraid that she might hit herself or damage the kitchen.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cv48L+ShL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cv48L+ShL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cv48L+ShL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cv48L+ShL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cv48L+ShL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61cv48L+ShL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uIlzvKZUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uIlzvKZUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61uIlzvKZUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71436ur7+cL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71436ur7+cL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71436ur7+cL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JRntTBMhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JRntTBMhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JRntTBMhL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dUbjZaxeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dUbjZaxeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dUbjZaxeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dUbjZaxeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dUbjZaxeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dUbjZaxeL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lwYLPmaYL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lwYLPmaYL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lwYLPmaYL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nznp2GHlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nznp2GHlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nznp2GHlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nznp2GHlL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nznp2GHlL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nznp2GHlL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AHJD2U6BPXGW2KK6YKQNCKPMEKIA,1475001228000,31,False

Some have a painted head (that go in visible locations) and some are just silver. The instructions don’t specify between the two so you have to pay attention to what spots are visible. Other than that, the instructions are very straight forward and way to follow. Also we added push lights and spray painted the handles/knobs/sink gold.

855,4.0,"Great product, but few flaws","So we couldn't keep our little one out of our real kitchen. Decided to get this one so he could cook in his own kitchen. And now he takes spatulas and pots from our kitchen to his kitchen.<br /><br />It's big, it's nice, it's ALMOST perfect.<br /><br />First: During assembly, the screws that you get are different but labeled the SAME. There are painted screws that should go on the ""outside outside"" but you don't know what's the ""Outside outside"" parts until the final steps. I ended up using some of the colored screws on the parts I thought would be showing, but they really ended up being covered. I wish the labels were different so L screw that's Brown is not same as L screw that's not Brown.<br /><br />Second: The label on the knobs for the oven. It's printed up-side-down. Yup, there's only one way to install it because of the alignment of screws and notches. Can't rotate and install it. All the writing is up-side-down. I don't care, but I thought that was weird.<br /><br />Third: Lot of sharp edges. When I say sharp, I mean REALLY sharp edges. The outside of the kitchen is rounded but each door that opens has sharp corner. This is not good as a child can injure themselves. So we're always watching our little one as he plays in the kitchen.<br /><br />Other than that, everything worked out perfectly.

865,5.0,"Easy to assemble, but take your time","This is an amazing play kitchen. It came really fast and I had to hide it, as it is a Christmas gift for my 3 year old twins. So yesterday I had to assemble it because it takes time and I wanted to surprise them when they returned from daycare. To say the least, they were ECSTATIC!!<br />Now let's talk about the product. These are my honest reviews of the process, from assembly to play time.<br />Assembly: I am a single parent, a female, and I am not familiar with assembling products like these, so for me, this was a challenge. It took me 3 hours of painstaking detail and I SUCEEDED by taking my time and carefully READ the manual, analyzing the pictures to make sure I was doing it right. Please DO THE SAME. YOU WILL THANK ME LATER.<br />When you open the box, you will be overwhelmed by all the pieces. To decrease your anxiety,  the best advice is to place all the pieces by order number, spreading them on your living room. Make sure the floor is clean and free of carpets and other obstacles. Yes. The pieces are numbered. And they FIT PERFECTLY where they need to go.<br />Then, please gather your tools. It comes with an Allen key and a tiny wrench. If you dont want to lose your wrist twisting and turning and if you want to keep your back pain free, get a cordless drill!<br />After you organize your tools, get the box with all the screws and bolts and things you will need from the big box. They are also numbered, and FLIP it upside down so that the cardboard surface is facing you. Each receptacle has a tiny tab. You just press with your thumb and get what you need. It took me a while to get it. And after I did, EVERYTHING moved faster. It is important to say that there are EXTRA PIECES just in case. It is just a precaution. Dont be alarmed if you see them after you are done. Just save them just in case. And dont get frustrated. The manufacturer included them FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE.<br />Now it is time to start. Please, FOLLOW THE PICTURES IN THE MANUAL TO THE T. THEY ARE SUPER CLEAR AND TO THE POINT. Take your time. And please, look at all the details, see where the grooves go, where the different bits and bobs are supposed to go, so you dont have to go back and disassemble the whole thing!<br />As I said, the pieces match to perfection and the holes for the screws are just perfectly aligned. I was extremely surprised when I finished. I COULDN'T BELIEVE I WAS ABLE TO PULL IT OFF ON MY OWN.<br />Please, note the gadgets come with batteries that are protected with a pull-out plastic. Remember to pull it out from the stove tops BEFORE installing them! The same with the refrigerator ice maker! Pull the tiny plastic string out.<br />And that is it!! It sounds, it sizzles and it is SO WONDERFUL! I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS IF I COULD.<br />My kitchen was a returned item. I know because some of the holes did not look brand new and unscrewed. It doesnt matter to me. The previous customer probably returned it out of frustration. I know because the holes suddenly were brand new almost at the end of the assembly. Again, I didn't care because the end product  IS JUST PERFECT.<br />And that is it!! Tonight, December 24, we will be getting the pots and pans and the play food and everything else we asked Santa. So I will update with pics.<br />If you are looking for a super trendy and sturdy play kitchen, GET THIS ONE.<br />YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT and the happiness and elation in your kids faces will more than compensate for the hours you will spend figuring how to build it.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGK262CVTB5THWFFVVN3AOTF225Q,1608846159054,0,False

Each major piece was numbered.  Each step was numbered.  And if you paid attention and followed the steps exactly, it all just worked. The best part was Step 1 used piece 1.  For a lot of the steps the step number and part number were the same.  One small improvement could be made.  The screws and bolts were on a sheet of cardboard under clear plastic bubbles.  There were two groups of screws that had the same letter code, one with painted screw heads and one with metal screw heads with no color.  The directions didn't indicate which to use when so we used the painted ones where we should have used the plain ones and when we got to the steps where we should have had the painted ones they were all used up, so the outside of the kitchen has silver screw heads which should have been painted ones.  It wasn't serious enough to take it all apart and start over but it would have been nice to know.  But the ease of assembly is truly amazing.

939,4.0,Mostly great,"This kitchen is so cute, and I'm so excited for my son to play with it!  As with the others, we found the assembly very time-consuming, but I think it will be worth it.  We took some others' suggestions and ordered a little stick-on LED light for above the sink.  I really have to compliment the manufacturer for actually putting the screws in clearly labeled compartments (with labels on front and back) so that you know you are using the right pieces.  There were even a few extras included, which we ended up needing.  They could take this a step further by giving the brown-headed screws a different letter in the instructions so that you would know to use them for the visible, outer parts of the kitchen.  When you first start working on assembling, it's not totally clear which pieces will be on the outside.  Alternatively, the manufacturer could also just send mostly brown screws other than for the silver top and the back parts.  Before you start working on this, if you don't already have one, it would be a good idea to buy a &#34;stubby&#34; screwdriver, which I was able to find on Amazon.  There are a few screws on this that you need to get inserted in really close quarters, where you cannot use a typical-length screwdriver.  As some others have commented, it would also take this product to the next level to provide some real beeping buttons for the &#34;microwave&#34; and &#34;washer.&#34;  And speaking of the washer, it would also probably make more sense for this to be a dishwasher given that the company sells a washer/dryer toy.  I also really wish that the area above the stove had a backing so that items would not fall behind the wall or scratch the wall.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGR45A5YOOHV2C24ZGRTCQDI6GAA,1524677963844,0,False

The doors all open easily for children to use, but also close securely to keep their play food, plates, etc. inside neatly.<br />As any great parent would do, we waited until 10pm or so the night before her birthday to assemble this. Not the brightest idea we've had, but we actually had fun putting it together. The instructions were easy to follow, the parts were separated into sections, and everything was labeled.  I highly recommend giving yourself and a partner at least 3-4 hours & 2 bottles of wine to put this bad boy together.

Batteries included.<br />- Ice maker on fridge makes an ice maker sound. Batteries included. Very cute.<br />- Lots of shelves for storage.<br />- Doors open and close smoothly and completely.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Backsplash graphics behind the sink look a little cheap.<br />- Shelves are the same all the way across. All the same color, even in the fridge and oven.<br />- There is a clothing washer, but seeing as the company makes a separate washer/dryer set (and I’ve never seen a clothing washer in a kitchen) wouldn’t it make more sense for this to be a dish washer?<br />- The fridge / washer have a lot of vertical space, but you can’t really take advantage of it without storage containers or an avalanche of toys.<br />- It would be nice if there were buttons on the microwave, and weren’t just painted on.<br /><br />Enhancements I made:<br />- Bought Melissa and Doug pots and pans set and used a command hook to attach it to the side for easy access.<br />- put two command hooks over the large counter top in front of the “window” to hang a measuring cup set + measuring spoon set<br />- put some peel and stick “tile” on the backsplash for a more realistic look.<br />- put motion lights inside the fridge and microwave. I’ll probably put two more in the freezer and oven.<br />- used some command hooks to put a small basket in front of the sink to hold dish rags.<br />- put a small basket in the sink as a dish strainer<br />- put some small wire organizers with legs in the fridge and washer so more items could fit in without being in boxes.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AELU4NU56JRIFL3AJ56RSUYATU3Q,1606092680499,3,True

987,4.0,Fun for all ages!,My husband just put this together yesterday for our daughter's Christmas present.  It took him a little over 2 hours to complete due to all of the pieces but it is a sturdy piece of &#34;furniture&#34;.  The ice maker works as well as the stove when you set pots and pans down on the burner.  My only concern is the possibility of pulling too hard on the handles and it coming forward.  We have it sitting on carpet so it is a bit more wobbly when the doors are opened.  I am sure with time those latches will loosen up and we won't have any issues at all.

1002,5.0,This kitchen is beautiful and my kids love it!,"Pros:<br />Super sturdy, this will not fall on your kids at all.<br />The oven door opens to the side rather than down. At first I didn't like this because it wasn't as realistic but then I realized I stops my toddler from standing on it and flipping the kitchen like she did with the old plastic one.<br />Great hieght for toddlers, decent for older kids too. I would say it's perfect for 2/4 year olds. But you won't really find anything bigger for the price and my 6&2 year olds don't complain :)<br />Every piece had the right sticker on it and everything was labeled, making assembly much easier.<br />Came with extra hardware pieces and instructions for battery change.<br />Cons:<br />No light aside from the stove top burners and ice maker. I'll have to add puck lights because it's pretty dark.<br />It doesn't come with anything but the phone, and the phone is very very cheap feeling/looking.<br />While assembly was decently easy, it took 4/5 hours. Me and my husband ended up breaking about 3 pieces as we screwed them in. This hasn't affected the product but, like one of the little hanging knobs above the stove now can turn.<br />Following the steps, a few steps were VERY difficult as even a slim screw driver didn't fit at the correct angle.<br />As others have said, it's really hard to tell what will be the outside and inside. Only some screws will be finished with the outside color, and the instructions don't tell you which to use. So about half of the outside screws just had to be silver","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EbId7pH5L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EbId7pH5L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EbId7pH5L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AH7ELSLEORUG2P6LLEXWCHSBL3DQ,1591882040045,2,True

She loves this kitchen and plays with it a ton with her 4 year old brother.  We added the drawer lights on Amazon that are motion activated (mentioned in another review) so when you open any area it lights up.  Be careful when installing those, if not placed very far forward you will have to buy more and the stickers don’t come off.  Next we added the peel and stick tile from another review and love how that looks!  It’s so much better than the cardboard picture this comes with.  We added some 3M hooks to the side for extra storage from Amazon also pictured.<br /><br />My one complaint and why I gave this 4/5 stars is the oven is not deep enough.  If you buy some of the cute Melissa and Doug cookies and cookie sheets they will not fit.  The door will not close.  It is very frustrating.  This oven is not the same depth as the other kitchens out there so carefully consider this when buying any play items that go in the oven.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1FeTRgfxyS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1FeTRgfxyS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1FeTRgfxyS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YdaVodE1S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YdaVodE1S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1YdaVodE1S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1ntTk7nzpS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1ntTk7nzpS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1ntTk7nzpS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGYANRIJHTXWU6FS3ZWROF7DUDDQ,1609556179606,4,True

This one was more expensive than the others, but I didn’t mind paying the money for the product advertised.  Upon opening the set, the oven door was completely cracked in half. And the edges are very sharp! I called the manufacturer and was told all I needed to do was submit for a replacement part! No problem, easy enough (although my child then didn’t receive the big birthday gift as hoped). I was then told that the  piece was on back order and would be a couple weeks. A month later I still haven’t heard anything, meanwhile this product is still actively being sold on Amazon. I reached out again for an ETA only to be told there is no date in sight for this part, that it probably wouldn’t be available until the summer. This set that cost almost $200 that I purchased in January. And conveniently now I am past the date of any kind of return or refund.<br /><br />I understand anything can happen during shipping, but this is not right! So if you have a child who really wants this set, do not take your chances with this company! I wish I had gone elsewhere.

1069,5.0,Must have!!!,"And yes it did took us 3 hours to assemble it but instructions were clear and easy there's just so many details. I love everything about it especially it's a corner kitchen.<br /><br />I love how the stove lights up and makes a sound but I wish the button is sensitive a little, so that when we put a pot on top, it will automatically lights up. Also, the microwave buttons are just painted so there's really nothing to do in there, sounds and actual buttons would have been nice.<br /><br />There's two things I didn't like, the washing machine door hole isn't sturdy. I feel like it will not last long. Another thing is the screws that are painted, I have checked the reviews before assembling the kitchen and I was aware about those screws, but there's no way for me to know where to place them. It's not a big deal and not noticeable so we just let it be. Overall, I do love it!

1071,5.0,LOVE this kitchen,"I read many reviews on this purchase before making it. When I originally viewed this kitchen set, it was listed at one price and when I decided to purchase it, it was $35 cheaper! It is now $70 more than my purchasing price. So it may be worth watching the price on this.<br />I bought this for my 2 year old son for his birthday. At school, he enjoys the kitchen area and he likes to play with food outside in his play house, so this seemed like the perfect gift. We gave it to him 5 days ago and after reading reviews, we were well aware it would take 4 hours or so to put it together, and it did. Mostly because I started the process. Had my husband done the entire thing, it would have moved quicker! It is truly a  QUALITY piece!! Normally things like this, the holes don't line up and we end up having to make our own holes just to get it done. But we didn't have any issues. My only complaint and just a warning... there are screws that are colored for those screws that will be visible once complete. I really really wish they had made them a different letter. I didn't realize this and in the end we had to change some screws around to make it work. So just keep that in mind... use silver anywhere it won't be visible on the outside (does not include the inside of the fridge. My son loved the stove lighting up and the sound effects and he loved all the doors that he could open and close. We have a lot of Melissa and doug Let's Play House items, and they all work well with this set. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to buy a kitchen set. I chose this over the Melissa and doug set primarily for the storage component. I love the open counter, the attached fridge (what ikea's kitchen set lacked), I found it unique it had the washer but my son loves that feature too! And it is a large area for storage. I am SO happy with this purchase and I look forward to years of use!!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EBdOAfn9L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EBdOAfn9L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EBdOAfn9L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ip-+uhd7L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ip-+uhd7L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ip-+uhd7L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TrMl2DafL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TrMl2DafL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71TrMl2DafL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lgg+1ecaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lgg+1ecaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lgg+1ecaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AFUVUQJGN26MPRFR2RBTUDQNI5MA,1500610596315,7,True

This kitchen was in our home for a year and a half with my oldest, we moved and didn’t have space inside so it sat in the garage for almost a year and a half. I recently brought it back in, wiped it down, and gathered all the accessories for my 6 and almost 2 year old. They love it, especially the youngest. The only piece that has come loose is the curved faucet. It hasn’t came out completely though and my youngest tries to pull it out! Great purchase that I’m sure will last both my kids and then some.

I purchased a scratch and dent but found only one minor stripped hole  which I fixed with a dab of wood glue. This item was definitely worth my money. I used a hand held screwdriver and the 2 tools that were provided with the hardware nothing else was needed. No drill needed.

1175,5.0,"Amazing kitchen, great value","I shopped around for MONTHS comparing different brands and styles of play kitchens for my daughter. This set is everything I was looking. It looks realistic has all of the standard kitchen items ( sink, range, fridge, microwave). The biggest selling points for me were that it is a corner unit and all one piece. There are even built in shelves for storing the play food/dishes/ utensils. The stove burners and ice machine are battery operated and make realistic noises. The stove knobs click like a real stove turning.  Extra counter space for additional appliances (we are able to fit a little Keurig, standing mixer, and toaster on the counter above the washer).<br /><br />Assembly was...laborious. I’m the assembler in the house and was able to do this completely by myself, but let me tell you I had my moments. The directions are easy to follow and the parts are clearly labeled and the hardware is precisely packaged and labeled. The challenge is that there are SO MANY pieces. It took me about 5 hours total over 2 nights to complete this. I will say that the complexity of assembly really just speaks to the quality of the piece- this is not a snap together cheap plastic gaudy toy.<br /><br />It looks amazing in my daughters room and she absolutely loves it.

You just have to be very gentle. It took me about 3 hours to complete. Also if you are very crafty like me and love to DIY THINGS PLEASE DO YOUR CHILD A FAVOR AND DO THIS!! I installed those little insertable Christmas  village lights into each compartment! I used a 1 inch drill hole maker thingy (your husband will know what I’m talking about lol) it fits perfect for the little night light bulbs! I even got super crafty and painted the oven light orange! So neat right?! I also ran a led light bar under the microwave to light the sink! The backsplash is also customized I did not like the fake look of the soap and plant. I got the peel foil from dollar tree! Also there is no back behind the stove I got a piece of foam board from dollar tree and taped it up with its own custom backsplash!!! I just love this little kitchen for my daughter!

Kitchen is beautiful! Love all the sounds and features. Set up with ample time before Christmas. My little man is gonna love it!<br /><br />One year update....<br />Kitchen has held up great! Except the water knobs fell off. I'm actually really happy I bought this piece in particular. My plan was for the kids to share a room so that our spare room could still function as a play room. That didn't work out. So I had this seemingly huge kitchen I had to fit in the corner of my son's room. Not only did it fit perfectly BUT it also stores a ton of toys! It's really like a 2 for 1. Toy storage plus it's a toy!

There are 4 plastic "" hooks "" that go over the stove which are cheap plastic and way to big diameter wise to hang anything on them. Most pots and pans or utensils that would fit in this kitchen don't come with a hole bigger than my finger for hanging.  Smaller metal hooks seem like they would be more useful. The other thing is too many parts, some of which could have been assembled without taking up much more space. Takes a long time to assemble. Luckily i put it together the night before because i can't see the kids patiently waiting 2 hrs for their new toy to be assembled when that was the main birthday gift. Overall a quality product that seems like it'll last for quite a while. While reading other reviews I saw a suggestion for putting lights inside of the appliances,  great idea!!!

1440,4.0,Purchased this for my 2 year old son for Christmas ...,"Purchased this for my 2 year old son for Christmas.  Here are 6 important things you should do/know first:<br />(1) Open box and layout each piece in numerical order and follow the instructions, step by step except for my below #2 and #5.<br />(2) Pull the plastic tabs that separate the batteries from the connectors on the ice cube maker and both gas range burners before attaching them<br />(3) There are duplicate screws with natural silver metal heads and DTM (dyed to match) brown metal heads.  Instructions do not advise when to use which and I still don't know.  I would advise to use all the silver ones first and once you've go through those, start using the brown ones.<br />(4) Make sure to use the Brown side of the bottom corner back board to face the front (towards you).  The white side should face the back.<br />(5) Install the Faucet before installing the counter top (as you would in real life)<br />(6) There is 1 wooden dowel.  Keep this. It's for the curtains.<br /><br />It took 2 people 3.5 hours to assemble the entire project.  Once it was done, it was well worth it.  My son loves it and I added a battery operated light switch for above the counter top and in the oven.  I also printed a picture of our family with our phone numbers and double-side taped it onto the phone.  And to prevent items from falling behind the kitchen from the counter tops, I printed an outdoor scenery and taped that on cardboard to cover the openings.  There's a lot more you can add to this to make it more authentic and personalize it.<br /><br />The doors can be a little hard to open and close as the locking mechanism is a little tight but should loosen over time, or at least your child will get stronger.  The kitchen could use a another shelf in the fridge and dishwasher.<br /><br />Otherwise, my son absolutely loves the ice cube maker and faux gas flames and sounds.

1482,1.0,"When I spend hundreds of dollars, I expect a product to work","I bought this kitchen for my daughter this past Christmas and while I will say that it is a beautiful toy, I don't think it's worth the hassle!<br /><br />I'm entirely competent, I build all of our real furniture, all of my daughter's toys. I have never come across a product with worse instructions. Not only were they extremely unclear and difficult to follow, but some steps were missing entirely! I had all kinds of unused parts at the end and combed back through the manual searching for what to do with them... only to find they were never mentioned. So after spending about 4 hours building this thing as per the instructions, I had to spend another 2 hours taking apart large portions of it to add parts that apparently they forgot existed! But a frustrating building experience is almost a right of passage for parents, no?<br /><br />Well, the issues don't end there. One of the stove burners doesn't work. It worked intermittently a handful of times while I tried fixing it, before dying completely. When I went to their site to order a replacement part, I was prompted to provide what I can only describe as an annoying and inconvenient amount of information. I know that's a small thing to fuss over, but given how needlessly frustrating every aspect of this kitchen had been up until that point, proving several different types of proof of purchase made me mad. It just felt like they were doing whatever they could to avoid actually having to replace anything. And of course when I go to pick the part I needed, the site informed me that they no longer made that part and it was not available to order. No further instructions on how to remedy the situation, basically just &#34;sorry, we don't make and don't have the product you bought a month ago&#34;. Which is ridiculous. Again, the impression I got is that KidKraft is doing everything in its power to not replace parts that THEY made poorly. Not parts that had broken with a lot of play and use, parts that arrived broken.<br /><br />So now I am in the process of emailing KidKraft about the part, but again the process is drawn out and frustrating. And as the window on their 90 day guarantee is quickly closing, I thought I might have better luck leaving a review here than I have from emailing them directly.<br /><br />Look, if the product were cheap, all this might be acceptable. However, it's not! For the money I spent on this headache of a play kitchen, I could have made under our tree look like we robbed Santa's workshop. I would certainly think twice about purchasing anything from KidKraft in the future because of this experience.<br /><br />EDIT Feb 16:<br />They finally sent a replacement part which arrived in the mail today. It was the wrong part. The saga continues.",[],B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AG4HG73H7SEGFOHC5IG3Q2QG5XFQ,1518283057069,5,False

There were a few scratches on two or three of the pieces when we unboxed it. It was a minor disappointment in the grand scheme of the things. None of the scratches were on prominent pieces, so it didn't detract from the look of the kitchen at all.<br /><br />We added puck lights per the suggestion of another review. I would highly recommend this addition. We happened to get lights that have the ability for multiple colors so we could have a red light for the oven, a blue light for the fridge and freezer and white light for the microwave and under cabinet lighting.<br /><br />Since receiving her gift, our 2.5 year old daughter has played with it constantly.

I needed a second set of hands twice because the parts I was assembling were too long to hold both ends myself in order to connect them.<br />The directions were essentially clear. I wish the longest of the screws were labeled better so I knew which ones would be visible on the outside of the kitchen. Some of the screws were painted so it matches the wood color and I wound up mixing them up with the ones that were not supposed to be visible. If you’re handy, that probably would be caught early. Another thing is that a few times, there wasn’t enough hand space to screw in all the way, so it takes extra time to screw in using Less than 1/4 turns.<br /><br />One thing I noted is that when the batteries need to be replaced for the stove and fridge, it’ll pretty much be a pain because of the award angle you’ll have to unscrew them to change the batteries...for the stove at least.<br /><br />It doesn’t come with accessories, so I ordered separate stuff to come at the same time.

1671,5.0,Great Kitchen!!!!,"I love love love this kitchen. I bought this kitchen as a Christmas present for my 22 month old. It is a great size and fits perfectly in a small cornered area, mine fits perfectly behind my couch, not to mention it looks nice. With my daughter being 22months old I was worried about the initial size and that the kitchen would possibly be to big for her but it isn’t. It’s the perfect size and she is able to reach everything perfectly but still has room to grow with the kitchen. I also love the fact that it has actual realistic sound effects and displays such as the stove Top lighting up and making sizzling sounds And the ice machine on the fridge lighting up and making ice dispensing sounds which majority of the kitchens I’ve looked at did not have. Also the assemble time was as expected about 2hrs. Overall this kitchen is great. I do have one concern, after a week of having the kitchen the ice sound machine stopped working, it stopped lighting up and making any noise. I’m hoping this is just a battery problem and by changing the small batteries it will work again.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719H22v7AjL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719H22v7AjL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719H22v7AjL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S5x6+J9IL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S5x6+J9IL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71S5x6+J9IL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SwNweOPLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SwNweOPLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SwNweOPLL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AGZSKJJSOHJDFJQJK25Y4XSNWLTQ,1579058451397,0,True

1735,2.0,Grab some wine before assembling!,"My son had been begging me for this exact play kitchen for months and when Amazon had a used one for sale I just had to get it. I've never bought anything used on Amazon before so I was a little concerned. But it arrived on time. I was warned that the box would be damaged and that some parts were cosmetically damaged but that it worked and had all the parts. I was okay with that risk and proceeded anyway. When we got it the box was so destroyed that I was surprised that it even made it to my house. Assembly was an absolute nightmare, it took probably 3 hours to do by myself and with a drill. You don't need it but it helps. But be careful a drill can be too powerful for some parts so you'll need a regular screwdriver as well. We've had a different kid kraft kitchen before and even though it was small, assembly for that was horrid as well. So I was expecting as much. There were several parts missing despite the fact that the description said the damages were only cosmetic and that it would be fully functional. Well, it's not functional with missing parts. So that was extremely disappointing. However, I was able to order the exact parts for it from the kidkraft website for free and that was honestly so amazing and for that alone I was impressed with kidkraft. We added some stick on lights for a more homey feel. In my honest opinion I am satisfied with the finished product. HOWEVER, I do not recommend buying this at full price as it doesn't seem worth it in my opinion.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oJm996T0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oJm996T0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oJm996T0L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01C49MCCS,B01LALE67U,AF54W7G6ZBRJ7W6UYP6OW7E4XICA,1592682307370,0,False

1791,5.0,BEST KIDS KITCHEN OUT THERE!,Amazing! I'm one of those moms who researches a big toy for months before I purchase. I became that way after I bought a few toys and after I received I wasn't happy.<br /><br />Needless to say I tried several kitchens before and this by FAR is the best! The sounds from the burners and ice maker are very realist and the extra counter space and washing machine just put this over the top. It's the tallest kitchen I could find and enough space for a few kids to play with at the same time.<br /><br />I posted pictures of my little girl playing with it! I'm also posting videos on YouTube. She loves that it actually has room to fit her cookies and cakes into the oven and microwave. The Melissa and Doug Disney cookies fit in the oven perfectly! (The bigger cookie sheet if their Christmas and regular cookies does not fit). Her previous kitchens microwaves and oven could hold a plate much less and cookie sheet.<br /><br />My only disappointment is not enough shelves in fridge and bottom cabinet.<br /><br />Still the best out there and the quality is over the top! It's heavy and not going to fall over on your one year old like my previous step 2 kitchen did.

We didn’t have an real issue assembling it like some reviews state.<br />However, the oven is too small for the very basic cookie set that is also sold on amazon (pictured) so my husband had to cut a slit in the back of the over for the plan to slip into for the door to shut.<br /><br />The water/ice slot is way too small for any cup except a Dixie cup, like other reviews also state.<br /><br />There is no backing to the fridge so things fall out the back. I realize it should probably be up against a wall, but it’d be more convenient if it also had backing like the oven.<br /><br />Overall, mostly happy with it since the kids love it and it is being used like we’d intended.

1902,4.0,Requires some work but a solid piece,"The product is well made and the construction, while taking a few hours, was not overly difficult.
